Drawing inspiration from Psalm 119:112-116, we explore the profound shift from performing religious duties to embodying a spirit of true obedience and devotion. Learn how to cultivate a deep-seated aversion to spiritual instability, find solace and protection in the Lord, and place unwavering hope in His Word.
Join us as we navigate through the three key inclinations that can transform your relationship with God: hating all forms of instability, hiding in the Lord during times of trouble, and hoping in God&amp;apos;s Word as the ultimate source of truth and salvation. This sermon is not just about what we do but about who we are inclined to be in the Spirit.
