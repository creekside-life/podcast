      <title>Sunday Evening Q&amp;A #5</title>
      <description>In this lesson we tackle three common questions Christians keep asking. What does a faithful daily walk actually look like in today’s world. What happens when we die. And what is the place of prayer and fasting in the life of a disciple.
From 1 Peter 3:15 we start with a heart ready to answer with gentleness and respect, then we move into practical, grace-driven habits drawn from the life of Jesus and the pattern of the early church. We talk about Bible study, prayer, serving, discipleship, dying to self, visiting the sick, and using our spiritual gifts, not as a way to earn God’s love, but as a response to the gospel.
We also look carefully at what Scripture says about death, comfort, and hope. Passages like Luke 23:43, 2 Corinthians 5:8, Philippians 1:23, 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18, and John 11:25-26 help us think through “sleep,” “paradise,” and the coming resurrection, and why this matters for both Christians and those outside of Christ.
Finally, we ground prayer and fasting in God’s power and God’s purposes, using texts such as Matthew 6:16-18, James 5:16-18, Acts 13:2-3, and Isaiah 58. If you have been stuck between legalism and laziness, or if questions have been weighing on you, this message is meant to bring clarity, courage, and a steadier walk with the Lord.</description>

      <title>Renewing Your Minds</title>
      <description>Renewing your mind is more than positive thinking. Romans 12:1-2 shows how God’s mercy changes the way we live, especially when the holidays bring stress, loneliness, financial pressure, and unrealistic expectations. In this lesson we walk through four Bible-centered anchors for a renewed mind: the mercies of God, the teaching of Jesus, being reshaped into God’s image, and the renewing work of the Holy Spirit.
We’ll also connect renewal to everyday discipleship: staying watchful in prayer (Mark 14:38), learning to take harmful thoughts captive (2 Corinthians 10:3-5), and choosing what is true, honorable, and excellent (Philippians 4:8-9). If this season feels heavy, you’re not alone. God calls us to present ourselves to Him and let His word reshape us from the inside out so we can recognise His good will and walk in it.

      <title>God’s Unexpected Child</title>
      <description>Christmas is not nostalgia. It is God keeping His promises. In this lesson we walk from Isaiah 7:14 and 9:6-7 to Matthew 1:18-25 and Luke 2:1-20, listening to what people said about Jesus and what God said about Him. Some called Him illegitimate, a friend of sinners, and a blasphemer. God names Him Immanuel, rightful King, and His Son. We look at why the virgin birth matters for a real Savior, how His kingdom is in our midst, and why that brings hope in a negative world.
Texts used include Isaiah 7:14; 9:6-7; Micah 5:2; Matthew 1:18-25; Luke 2:1-20; John 10:30-33; John 18:36; Luke 5:31-32; John 1:14; Galatians 4:4-5; Ecclesiastes 7:10; and more.

      <title>Joy to the World</title>
      <description>Explore why real joy is more than a seasonal feeling and why it holds steady even when life is heavy. We begin with Luke 2 and the coming of Jesus, then connect the words of Isaac Watts’ hymn to the Bible’s picture of Christ as King and Savior. From there, we walk through several passages that show where the Lord places lasting joy: in His presence, in doing what is right, in worship and praise, in the strength He provides, in repentance, in the fruit of the Spirit, and in the hope of heaven.
This message is also a reminder that joy is not the same as pretending everything is fine. The New Testament shows believers rejoicing while still facing trials, because joy is rooted in the Lord, not in perfect circumstances. If you have been stuck in complaint, carrying bitterness, or feeling drained, this lesson points back to the kind of joy Scripture calls us to pursue through faith, prayer, gratitude, and obedience to Jesus.</description>

      <title>God’s Unexpected Love</title>
      <description>Christmas can get loud and busy fast, and it’s easy to miss what it’s really pointing to. This lesson centers on one simple truth: God showed His unexpected love in Jesus Christ. Using Ephesians 3:14-21, we think through the width, length, depth, and height of Christ’s love, a love that surpasses knowledge but can still be truly known because God revealed it to us. We also talk about why many people in Jesus’ day expected a political rescuer, while Jesus spoke of a spiritual kingdom (John 18:36) and came to save in a deeper way than anyone expected.
If you feel worn down, guilty, or unsure where you stand with God, this message points you back to the heart of Christmas. God gave His Son for the world (John 3:16), and that love calls for a response. We want to believe Jesus, turn back to God, confess Christ, and be baptized into Him for the forgiveness of sins (Acts 2:38; Romans 10:9-10; Galatians 3:27).

In this lesson from Matthew 2:1-12, we follow the wise men as they seek the newborn King, and we connect the song’s three verses to three gospel truths: Christ’s appearing gives the soul its worth, His coming invites us into friendship with God, and His discipleship brings real freedom from sin.</description>

      <title>Christmas: God’s Unexpected Plan</title>
      <description>What if Christmas is God’s most unexpected plan showing up in an ordinary town and an ordinary life? In Luke 1:26-38 we meet Gabriel, a startled teenager named Mary, and the promise of a King whose kingdom will never end. We look at the angel’s greeting, the call to fear not, the name Jesus, the forever throne of David, and the overshadowing work of the Holy Spirit. Mary’s simple words, “Let it be to me according to your word,” still teach us how to trust today.
Scriptures: Luke 1:26-38, 2 Samuel 7:12-16, Isaiah 7:14, Isaiah 9:6-7, with a preview in Luke 1:46-55. Great anyone hungry for hope rooted in God’s promises.

      <title>Silent Night</title>
      <description>A simple Christmas message with the Bible open to Luke 2 and John 1. We walk through Silent Night in three parts: the calm in Bethlehem, the angel’s good news to the shepherds, and the light of redeeming grace in Jesus Christ. We briefly note how the hymn began with Joseph Mohr and Franz Gruber, clear up common nativity mix ups, and invite each listener to respond to the gospel.
Scriptures: Luke 2:1-20, Matthew 2:1-12, John 1:1-14, Isaiah 9:2, 6-7, Titus 2:11.
How to respond: Hear the word (Romans 10:17), believe in Jesus (John 8:24), repent of sins (Acts 2:38), confess Christ (Romans 10:9-10), be baptized for the forgiveness of sins (Mark 16:16; Acts 22:16), and live faithfully (Revelation 2:10).</description>

      <title>Sunday Evening Q&amp;A #5</title>
      <description>Some questions are too real to ignore.
In this Q&amp;A lesson we wrestle with three of the hardest:
1. What if human limitation is not failure, but part of God’s design?
2. How should Christians think about grief when the pain just will not go away?
3. What does the Bible say about domestic abuse and a spouse’s obligation to an abusive partner?
Drawing from Romans 8-11, Psalms, the life of Jesus, and key Old and New Testament texts, we look at how God uses our limitations, how He meets us in seasons of deep sorrow, and why abuse is always sin and never God’s will for a marriage. This message speaks especially to those who have stayed in unsafe situations because they believed God required it. If you carry guilt or confusion about grief, weakness, or abuse, this study is meant to help you see God’s goodness and His heart for your safety and healing.
Passages referenced include: 1 Peter 3:15; Romans 8:18-23; Romans 9:21-23; Romans 11:32; Genesis 6:6; Psalms 78 and 95; Isaiah 63:10; Mark 3:5; Ephesians 4:30; various Old Testament accounts of violence and injustice; and additional texts on marriage, justice, and protection of the vulnerable.</description>

      <title>The Way</title>
      <description>Early Christians are described in Acts as followers of “the Way,” and that title still speaks today. In this message we explore how Luke uses that term, why names matter for the church, and how Jesus is not just a label but the path we walk. We trace seven mile markers from Scripture: Teaching, Jesus, Salvation, God’s Way, Peace, Truth, and Righteousness. Key texts include Acts 9, 19, 22, and 24 with John 14:6 at the center. We clear up common misunderstandings about ekklesia, connect the “Two Ways” theme from the Old Testament to the early church, and offer simple next steps for entering and walking the Way through faith in Christ, repentance, and baptism. This study serves anyone who wants to follow Jesus on the narrow road and live out the life of the church of Christ in everyday discipleship.
