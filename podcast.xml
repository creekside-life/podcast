      <title>Three Kinds of Transformation</title>
      <description>Three pivotal moments shape every believer: the Spirit-powered new birth, the ongoing renewal of the mind, and the future resurrection glory promised in Christ. Walk through Jeremiah 17, Romans 12, and Philippians 3 to see how God moves us from veil to vision, from world-shaped to Word-shaped, and ultimately from mortality to immortality. Along the way we test counterfeit “transformations,” trace stories of genuine change, and celebrate the liberty found where “the Lord is the Spirit.” Perfect for Bible class prep, small-group discussion, or anyone craving a deeper grasp of conversion, sanctification, and hope beyond the grave.</description>

      <title>The Biblical Case for Elder Rule</title>
      <description>Sheep thrive under skilled shepherds—so how should churches choose and honor their elders? In this message “Shepherding: The Biblical Case for Elder Rule,” we trace Acts 11–20 and the Pastoral Epistles to see how God-appointed leaders handle resources responsibly, decide weighty matters, guard doctrine, and nurture every believer. You’ll hear the dramatic rescue the over-grown sheep, learn why hand-raising in Acts 14 matters, and discover the difference between a hireling and a true overseer. Expect practical takeaways on spotting qualified elders, supporting them with “double honor,” and cultivating a shepherd’s heart in your own life. Stick around for three soul-searching questions that turn theory into action—perfect for small-group discussion or personal reflection. Join us and step into a richer, safer pasture under Christ, the Chief Shepherd of our souls.</description>
