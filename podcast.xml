      <title>Shepherding: Marks of a Good Shepherd</title>
      <description>What makes a shepherd good in the eyes of Jesus Not slick leadership tricks but a Shepherd who enters by the door, calls by name, and lays down His life. Walk through John 10 to see the protocols, purposes, and passions of the Good Shepherd and how elders, pastors, and parents can mirror His heart.</description>

      <title>Church Leaders’ Children: Must Not Be Accused of Dissipation or Insubordination</title>
      <description>What does Scripture mean when it says an elder’s children must not be accused of dissipation or insubordination (Titus 1:6)? This sermon unpacks the qualifications of church leaders, examining the balance between parental responsibility and a child’s free will.

      <title>Shepherding: The Effective Shepherd</title>
      <description>This message explores the six core traits of an effective shepherd, using Psalm 23 and the life of David to guide nominated elders and spiritual leaders in their calling. Real-world illustrations: a baby giraffe, a struggling butterfly, and windless trees reveal how challenge strengthens both shepherds and the flock. Discover how true leadership involves guidance, protection, preparation, and knowing when to step back. This lesson reminds us that while shepherds play a vital role, each believer must grow through their own struggles and ultimately learn to serve others.</description>

      <title>Shepherding: The Pathway to the Eldership</title>
      <description>Eldership grows where love for Jesus overflows. In John 21, the risen Lord restores Peter and gives a threefold charge: feed the lambs, shepherd the sheep, feed the sheep. This message shows how that commission shapes elders today with 1 Peter 5:1-4, Acts 20:28-31, Psalm 23, and John 10. Includes practical steps for aspiring shepherds, guidance for guarding the flock, and hope for those who have failed and want to start again.</description>

      <title>Church Leaders’ Children: Must Be Under Control</title>
      <description>Elders and aspiring leaders need a home that’s well-managed, respectful, and shaped by Scripture. This message walks through 1 Timothy 3:4-5 and Titus 1:6 with a practical three-R framework (Role, Rule, and Reverence) showing how a father can shepherd a household without harshness and model the kind of leadership Christ expects in His church.
We explore what “faithful/believing children” means, how to think about adult children, and how to practice measured, gospel-shaped correction that builds self-control. Along the way you will find encouragement for weary dads and concrete steps for family discipleship.
Keywords: elders qualifications, 1 Timothy 3, Titus 1, church leadership, household management, parenting with grace, family discipleship, self-control, gentle correction, shepherding the home, Luke 15 hope.</description>

      <title>Church Leader’s Wives: Must Be Faithful In All Things</title>
      <description>Faithful leadership always takes root at home. This lesson unpacks the short phrase “faithful in all things” from 1 Timothy 3 : 11 and reveals four complementary dimensions: watchful, exemplary, pleasing, and orderly. You will trace this theme through Scripture, from the steady courage of Moses to the climactic faithfulness of Christ, then step into a contemporary wedding where almost every guest failed to appear. The story stings, yet it highlights the beauty of steadfast love that refuses to quit, much like the shepherd’s goodness in Psalm 23 that keeps pursuing. Whether you are an elder’s wife, aspire to church leadership, or simply want to strengthen your everyday reliability, you will leave with practical tools, honest questions, and a fresh view of God’s unwavering covenant loyalty. Stay to the end for reflection prompts suited for family or small-group discussion and a brief profile of four women in Scripture who modeled authentic faithfulness.</description>

      <title>Church Leader’s Wives: Must Be Temperate</title>
      <description>Church leaders are not the only people called to live with steady minds and steady hands. Their spouses often set the tone. This lesson on 1 Timothy 3:11 traces the Greek word nēphalios and shows how true temperance takes shape through four everyday practices: abnegate unhealthy desires, self-regulate emotions, moderate opinions, and cultivate a sedate, clear head for sound judgment. We draw from ancient priestly rules, Proverbs level wisdom, and a modern cautionary tale to show why clear thinking matters in every home and congregation. You will find practical steps to guard your heart, support your spouse, and strengthen your witness. Ideal for elders, deacons, ministry couples, and anyone who wants self-control rooted in the Spirit instead of sheer willpower. Watch and use these habits to bring calm credibility to your family and your church.</description>

      <title>Church Leader’s Wives: Must Not Be Slanderers</title>
      <description>Why must church leaders&amp;apos; wives never be slanderers? This hard-hitting sermon breaks down 1 Timothy 3:11 with deep biblical insight, showing how gossip, whispers, and harmful speech not only destroy church harmony but mirror the behavior of the enemy himself. Using dozens of Scripture references and real-life examples, this message equips believers—especially women in leadership families—with the spiritual armor to guard their tongues, foster unity, and avoid disqualifying their families from service. Packed with wisdom, warnings, and real-world relevance.</description>

      <title>Three Kinds of Transformation</title>
      <description>Three pivotal moments shape every believer: the Spirit-powered new birth, the ongoing renewal of the mind, and the future resurrection glory promised in Christ. Walk through Jeremiah 17, Romans 12, and Philippians 3 to see how God moves us from veil to vision, from world-shaped to Word-shaped, and ultimately from mortality to immortality. Along the way we test counterfeit “transformations,” trace stories of genuine change, and celebrate the liberty found where “the Lord is the Spirit.” Perfect for Bible class prep, small-group discussion, or anyone craving a deeper grasp of conversion, sanctification, and hope beyond the grave.</description>
