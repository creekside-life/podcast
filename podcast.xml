      <title>Shepherding: Chasing the Title or the Towel</title>
      <description>On Ordination Sunday we slow down and look at the kind of leadership Jesus calls great. In John 13 the Lord takes a towel and shows elders and churches what real greatness looks like. This message walks through three “towels” for everyday ministry: the towel of smallness from John 3:30, the towel of spikenard from John 12:3, and the towel of service from John 13:14. We also hear Paul’s warning to shepherds in Acts 20, Ezekiel’s rebuke of failed shepherds, and Peter’s call to humble oversight in 1 Peter 5. It is practical, church focused, and ready for leadership training or elder appointments.
Scriptures: John 13:1-15; John 3:30; John 12:1-8; Acts 20:28-31; Ezekiel 34:1-10; 1 Peter 5:1-4; Mark 10:42-45; Philippians 2:5-8; 1 Thessalonians 5:12-14; Hebrews 13:17-18.</description>

      <title>The Last Sermon I Would Ever Preach</title>
      <description>If This Were the Last Sermon I Would Ever Preach: I Would One Last Time Preach Jesus.
From Acts 8:35, we trace the sweeping story of Christ-Prophesied in Isaiah 53, Proclaimed to the crowds, Identified as the Son of God, Ostracized by men, Crucified for our sins, Risen on the third day, and Glorified at the right hand of God. Along the way we hear an excerpt from “That’s My King,” reflect on living water that truly satisfies (John 4:14), and respond to the gospel with the humility of Acts 2:37-41.
Key texts: Acts 8:35; 2 Cor. 3:18; Matthew 4:25; Matthew 7:28; Matthew 16:16; John 8:48; John 10:33; 1 Cor 1:23; 1 Cor. 2:2; Acts 2:32; 1 Cor. 15:1-4; Acts 2:36; 1 Tim 3:16; Gal 3:1.</description>

      <title>Lord Show Us the Father: Faith Over Sight</title>
      <description>When life shouts through pain, Paul teaches us how to look past what is seen and fix our gaze on what is eternal. This message traces three contrasts: Internals, Incomparables, and Eternals, to show how God renews the inner person, outweighs present suffering with a true weight of glory, and anchors us beyond the tent of this body. Along the way we connect John 14 to the face of Christ, explore the Spirit’s guarantee, and swap fear for courage as we walk by faith, not by sight. If you need fresh courage in grief, uncertainty, or weakness, this sermon will help you see the Father by looking at Jesus.</description>

      <title>Shepherding: Affirmation and Commendations</title>
      <description>How does a church honor Christ’s work in people without slipping into flattery or favoritism?

      <title>Shepherding: The Mission in Submission to Church Leaders</title>
      <description>Hebrews 13:7-19 shows why healthy churches practice Christlike submission to shepherds and how that mission helps leaders teach, serve, and watch for our souls. With Jesus’ servant-leadership front and center Mark 10:42-45 and John 13 we explore practical ways to support elders and ministers, the biblical limits of authority Acts 5:29 and 1 Pet 5:3, and how praise, generosity, and prayer fuel a joyful flock Heb 13:15-18. Includes honest cautions about abuse, clear guardrails for accountability, and real-life steps any believer can take this week. Open your Bible to Hebrews 13 and walk with us toward a church culture shaped by the cross and filled with joy.</description>

      <title>Lord Show Us the Father: In a Gentle Breeze</title>
      <description>What if the clearest way God makes Himself known isn’t in the quake or the fire but in a gentle breeze? In this message we open John 3:8 and 1 Kings 19 to see how the Holy Spirit reveals the Father’s heart—sovereign in power, gentle in posture, mysterious in His ways, and authentic in His fruit. We’ll connect Jesus’ words to Nicodemus, Elijah’s moment at Horeb, and the everyday practices that help us “raise the sail” for the Spirit’s leading. 
Key texts: John 14:8–9; John 3:1–8; 1 Kings 19:11–13; Psalm 135:7; Galatians 5:22–23; 1 Thessalonians 5:19–21.</description>

      <title>Freedom</title>
      <description>Freedom is more than a right on paper. Looking at David and Goliath (1 Samuel 17), we talk about the freedom Jesus gives: freedom from fear, freedom in obeying God together as a church, freedom from sin by grace, and freedom from death so we can serve with courage. Even if earthly rights fade, Christ makes us truly free. If you need prayer or want to study the Bible, reach out to a faithful church. Like, share, and subscribe to help others hear this message.

      <title>Church Leaders’ Children: Must Not Be Accused of Dissipation or Insubordination</title>
      <description>What does Scripture mean when it says an elder’s children must not be accused of dissipation or insubordination (Titus 1:6)? This sermon unpacks the qualifications of church leaders, examining the balance between parental responsibility and a child’s free will. Through biblical examples, real-life cases, and a call to wise choices, we explore what it means for elders to lead faithful families and why this matters for the health of the church today.</description>

      <title>Shepherding: The Effective Shepherd</title>
      <description>This message explores the six core traits of an effective shepherd, using Psalm 23 and the life of David to guide nominated elders and spiritual leaders in their calling. Real-world illustrations: a baby giraffe, a struggling butterfly, and windless trees reveal how challenge strengthens both shepherds and the flock.

      <title>Shepherding: The Pathway to the Eldership</title>
      <description>Eldership grows where love for Jesus overflows. In John 21, the risen Lord restores Peter and gives a threefold charge: feed the lambs, shepherd the sheep, feed the sheep. This message shows how that commission shapes elders today with 1 Peter 5:1-4, Acts 20:28-31, Psalm 23, and John 10. Includes practical steps for aspiring shepherds, guidance for guarding the flock, and hope for those who have failed and want to start again.</description>

      <title>Church Leaders’ Children: Must Be Under Control</title>
      <description>Elders and aspiring leaders need a home that’s well-managed, respectful, and shaped by Scripture. This message walks through 1 Timothy 3:4-5 and Titus 1:6 with a practical three-R framework (Role, Rule, and Reverence) showing how a father can shepherd a household without harshness and model the kind of leadership Christ expects in His church.
We explore what “faithful/believing children” means, how to think about adult children, and how to practice measured, gospel-shaped correction that builds self-control. Along the way you will find encouragement for weary dads and concrete steps for family discipleship.
Keywords: elders qualifications, 1 Timothy 3, Titus 1, church leadership, household management, parenting with grace, family discipleship, self-control, gentle correction, shepherding the home, Luke 15 hope.</description>

      <title>Church Leader’s Wives: Must Be Faithful In All Things</title>
      <description>Faithful leadership always takes root at home. This lesson unpacks the short phrase “faithful in all things” from 1 Timothy 3 : 11 and reveals four complementary dimensions: watchful, exemplary, pleasing, and orderly. You will trace this theme through Scripture, from the steady courage of Moses to the climactic faithfulness of Christ, then step into a contemporary wedding where almost every guest failed to appear. The story stings, yet it highlights the beauty of steadfast love that refuses to quit, much like the shepherd’s goodness in Psalm 23 that keeps pursuing. Whether you are an elder’s wife, aspire to church leadership, or simply want to strengthen your everyday reliability, you will leave with practical tools, honest questions, and a fresh view of God’s unwavering covenant loyalty. Stay to the end for reflection prompts suited for family or small-group discussion and a brief profile of four women in Scripture who modeled authentic faithfulness.</description>

      <title>Church Leader’s Wives: Must Be Temperate</title>
      <description>Church leaders are not the only people called to live with steady minds and steady hands. Their spouses often set the tone. This lesson on 1 Timothy 3:11 traces the Greek word nēphalios and shows how true temperance takes shape through four everyday practices: abnegate unhealthy desires, self-regulate emotions, moderate opinions, and cultivate a sedate, clear head for sound judgment. We draw from ancient priestly rules, Proverbs level wisdom, and a modern cautionary tale to show why clear thinking matters in every home and congregation. You will find practical steps to guard your heart, support your spouse, and strengthen your witness. Ideal for elders, deacons, ministry couples, and anyone who wants self-control rooted in the Spirit instead of sheer willpower. Watch and use these habits to bring calm credibility to your family and your church.</description>

      <title>Three Kinds of Transformation</title>
      <description>Three pivotal moments shape every believer: the Spirit-powered new birth, the ongoing renewal of the mind, and the future resurrection glory promised in Christ. Walk through Jeremiah 17, Romans 12, and Philippians 3 to see how God moves us from veil to vision, from world-shaped to Word-shaped, and ultimately from mortality to immortality. Along the way we test counterfeit “transformations,” trace stories of genuine change, and celebrate the liberty found where “the Lord is the Spirit.” Perfect for Bible class prep, small-group discussion, or anyone craving a deeper grasp of conversion, sanctification, and hope beyond the grave.</description>

      <title>The Biblical Case for Elder Rule</title>
      <description>Sheep thrive under skilled shepherds—so how should churches choose and honor their elders? In this message “Shepherding: The Biblical Case for Elder Rule,” we trace Acts 11–20 and the Pastoral Epistles to see how God-appointed leaders handle resources responsibly, decide weighty matters, guard doctrine, and nurture every believer. You’ll hear the dramatic rescue the over-grown sheep, learn why hand-raising in Acts 14 matters, and discover the difference between a hireling and a true overseer. Expect practical takeaways on spotting qualified elders, supporting them with “double honor,” and cultivating a shepherd’s heart in your own life. Stick around for three soul-searching questions that turn theory into action—perfect for small-group discussion or personal reflection. Join us and step into a richer, safer pasture under Christ, the Chief Shepherd of our souls.</description>
