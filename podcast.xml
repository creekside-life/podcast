      <title>Sunday Evening Q&amp;A #12</title>
      <description>Tonight we tackle two big questions. When does God give a person a spirit, and does the Bible teach that souls existed before conception. We walk through passages like Jeremiah 1:5, Psalm 139, Acts 17:26 to 29, and Acts 10:34 to define God’s foreknowledge and God’s impartiality without turning providence into fatalism.
Then we address a practical salvation question. What if someone was baptized by immersion but repentance did not come first. We compare Mark 1:4, Acts 2:38, Romans 6:3 to 4, and 1 Peter 3:21 to clarify what biblical baptism is meant to express, how repentance relates to it, and how Scripture talks about returning to the Lord after wandering.
If you’ve ever felt anxious about whether you “did it right,” this lesson aims to replace confusion with a Bible-shaped conscience and a clearer path forward in Christ.</description>

      <title>The Cross Paradox</title>
      <description>In 1 Corinthians 1:18-25, Paul says the message of the cross is foolishness to the perishing but the power of God to the saved. This lesson, “The Cross Paradox,” traces how the gospel flips the world’s assumptions: weakness becomes strength, humility becomes greatness, and losing your life for Christ becomes the way you truly find it. We walk through why Christ crucified is offensive to worldly pride, why God’s wisdom confounds human wisdom, and how the cross reveals the love and justice of God meeting in one place. Along the way we connect key Scriptures including Isaiah 53, Galatians 3:13, Mark 10:42-45, and 1 Peter 3:18, and end with a clear call to embrace the cross-shaped life Jesus teaches.

      <title>Sunday Evening Q&amp;A #11</title>
      <description>In this lesson we put three major prophecy texts side by side to see how they relate: Daniel’s seventy weeks (Daniel 9:24-27), Paul’s comfort to grieving Christians about the Lord’s coming (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18), and John’s vision of the thousand years (Revelation 20:1-6).
We walk through what Daniel 9 promises Messiah will accomplish, why the passage has fuelled so many timelines, and where interpreters disagree about the final “week.” Then we look closely at what Paul actually says about the dead in Christ rising first, the living being caught up, and why the goal is comfort and hope rather than speculation. Finally, we compare premillennial, amillennial, and postmillennial readings of the millennium, including the binding of Satan, the “first resurrection,” and how Revelation moves toward final judgment and the new creation.
If you’ve ever wondered how the seventy weeks, the rapture passage, and the millennium fit together, this study aims to clarify the text, name the major viewpoints fairly, and keep the focus on the simplicity of Christ and the certainty of His victory.</description>

      <title>Sunday Evening Q&amp;A #10</title>
      <description>In this Q&amp;A session we tackle three tough topics Christians ask about often: The Book of Revelation and the rapture, a Christ-centered response to transgenderism and homosexuality, and Genesis creation days, 24-hour days or long ages.
We open with 1 Peter 3:15 and talk about learning to ask honest questions and give thoughtful answers with gentleness and respect. Along the way we compare common end-times views, study key passages like 1 Thessalonians 4 and Matthew 24, and clarify what Scripture actually says about marriage, holiness, and hope through Jesus Christ. We also examine several major interpretations of Genesis 1 and why Exodus 20 and Exodus 31 matter in the discussion. If you want a Bible-first approach that aims for conviction without cruelty, this lesson is for you.</description>

      <title>The Truth</title>
      <description>In John 8:28-32, Jesus connects truth with discipleship, obedience, and real freedom. This lesson walks through five practical pathways that lead people to the truth of Christ: Epiphany, Positivity, Stability, Clarity, and Liberty. Along the way we compare “right” with “almost right,” test our assumptions, and bring common claims back under the light of Scripture. If you want a faith that can handle hard questions, a Bible-centered way to discern truth from error, and a clearer view of what it means to be set free by Jesus, this message is for you.
If you want deeper study on “truth sets you free” in its full context, spend time reading John 8:31-36 and compare it with John 14:6 and John 17:17. Supporting passages include: Psalm 19, Psalm 119, Acts 1:3, Galatians 5, Hebrews 4

      <title>Sunday Evening Q&amp;A #9</title>
      <description>In this Bible Q and A lesson, we work through three questions that often come up in everyday conversations about faith. First, we talk about dinosaurs and fossils and how Christians can think clearly and honestly about what the Bible says and what it doesn’t claim to be addressing. Next, we study the Parable of the Mustard Seed from Matthew 13, Mark 4, and Luke 13, seeing how God’s kingdom can begin in what looks small and ordinary, yet grow in ways only the Lord can bring about. Finally, we walk through Jesus’ message to the church in Laodicea (Revelation 3) to understand what “lukewarm” faith looks like and how to turn from spiritual complacency into a life that is sincere, obedient, and close to Christ.
If you’ve ever wondered how to answer hard questions with gentleness (1 Peter 3:15), or you’ve felt your faith slipping into routine, this lesson is meant to help you think, listen, and respond in a way that honors Jesus and leads to real change.</description>

      <title>Sunday Evening Q&amp;A #8</title>
      <description>In this lesson we walk through four real questions Christians get all the time and aim to answer them with Scripture and a gentle spirit (1 Peter 3:15).
First, we study Luke 16 and the rich man and Lazarus, focusing on what Jesus was teaching about repentance, compassion, and the sufficiency of God’s word.
Second, we talk about dinosaurs, “millions of years,” and how Christians think through Genesis, biblical timelines, and academic claims with humility while keeping the resurrection of Jesus as the focus of our faith (1 Corinthians 15:3-4).
Third, we explain why Churches of Christ practice a cappella worship, looking at the New Testament pattern for singing (Ephesians 5:19; Colossians 3:16) and why we avoid adding worship elements God did not specifically authorise.
Fourth, we discuss infant baptism and why the New Testament links baptism to belief, repentance, and a personal appeal to God (Mark 16:16; Acts 2:38; 1 Peter 3:21).</description>

      <title>Born of Water and Spirit</title>
      <description>In John 3:1-12, Jesus tells Nicodemus that no one can enter God’s kingdom without being born again, born of water and the Spirit. This lesson walks through the context, the difference between exegesis and eisegesis, and four common interpretations of “water” in John 3:5: womb, Spirit, Word, and baptism. We trace how John’s Gospel flows straight into baptizing ministry (John 3:22-26; John 4:1-2), connect the new birth to repentance and forgiveness in apostolic preaching (Acts 2:38), and address common questions like the thief on the cross. If you’ve ever wondered what “born again” means in the Bible, how the Spirit relates to conversion, or why baptism matters in the New Testament, this study stays close to the text and asks you to choose truth over team loyalty.

      <title>The Body of Christ</title>
      <description>The Body of Christ is one living reality for the New Testament church. In this lesson we trace three threads that belong together in Scripture. First, the Word became flesh so our hope rests on the real birth, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Second, at the Lord’s Supper we remember His covenant, we proclaim His death, and we participate together in the one bread and one cup as a weekly practice on the first day of the week according to the apostolic pattern in Acts 20:7. Third, as members of one body we pursue unity, reconciliation, and service so that every part does its share.

      <title>Sunday Evening Q&amp;A #6</title>
      <description>In this Bible Q&amp;A we address three practical questions believers keep running into. First, how do you balance spiritual life with work, marriage, parenting, caregiving, and personal interests? Philippians 2:3-7 reframes the issue from managing time to having the mind of Christ, putting away selfish ambition, resisting pride, and learning to look to the interests of others.
Second, what does it mean to be wise as serpents but harmless as doves? In Matthew 10:16 Jesus prepares His disciples to live as sheep among wolves, combining discernment with pure motives so we can speak truth without becoming harsh, manipulative, or naive.
Third, we look at divorce and remarriage by tracing key Bible texts and why God takes covenant faithfulness seriously while still calling people to repentance, mercy, and a faithful path forward in Christ.
Key passages: 1 Peter 3:15; Philippians 2:3-7; Matthew 10:16; Matthew 5:31-32; Matthew 19:1-12; Mark 10:1-12; Romans 7:1-4; 1 Corinthians 7:10-16; Deuteronomy 24:1-4; Malachi 2:15-16.</description>

      <title>Sunday Evening Q&amp;A #5</title>
      <description>In this lesson we tackle three common questions Christians keep asking. What does a faithful daily walk actually look like in today’s world. What happens when we die. And what is the place of prayer and fasting in the life of a disciple.
From 1 Peter 3:15 we start with a heart ready to answer with gentleness and respect, then we move into practical, grace-driven habits drawn from the life of Jesus and the pattern of the early church. We talk about Bible study, prayer, serving, discipleship, dying to self, visiting the sick, and using our spiritual gifts, not as a way to earn God’s love, but as a response to the gospel.
We also look carefully at what Scripture says about death, comfort, and hope. Passages like Luke 23:43, 2 Corinthians 5:8, Philippians 1:23, 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18, and John 11:25-26 help us think through “sleep,” “paradise,” and the coming resurrection, and why this matters for both Christians and those outside of Christ.
Finally, we ground prayer and fasting in God’s power and God’s purposes, using texts such as Matthew 6:16-18, James 5:16-18, Acts 13:2-3, and Isaiah 58. If you have been stuck between legalism and laziness, or if questions have been weighing on you, this message is meant to bring clarity, courage, and a steadier walk with the Lord.</description>

      <title>Renewing Your Minds</title>
      <description>Renewing your mind is more than positive thinking. Romans 12:1-2 shows how God’s mercy changes the way we live, especially when the holidays bring stress, loneliness, financial pressure, and unrealistic expectations. In this lesson we walk through four Bible-centered anchors for a renewed mind: the mercies of God, the teaching of Jesus, being reshaped into God’s image, and the renewing work of the Holy Spirit.
We’ll also connect renewal to everyday discipleship: staying watchful in prayer (Mark 14:38), learning to take harmful thoughts captive (2 Corinthians 10:3-5), and choosing what is true, honorable, and excellent (Philippians 4:8-9). If this season feels heavy, you’re not alone. God calls us to present ourselves to Him and let His word reshape us from the inside out so we can recognise His good will and walk in it.

      <title>God’s Unexpected Child</title>
      <description>Christmas is not nostalgia. It is God keeping His promises. In this lesson we walk from Isaiah 7:14 and 9:6-7 to Matthew 1:18-25 and Luke 2:1-20, listening to what people said about Jesus and what God said about Him. Some called Him illegitimate, a friend of sinners, and a blasphemer. God names Him Immanuel, rightful King, and His Son. We look at why the virgin birth matters for a real Savior, how His kingdom is in our midst, and why that brings hope in a negative world.
Texts used include Isaiah 7:14; 9:6-7; Micah 5:2; Matthew 1:18-25; Luke 2:1-20; John 10:30-33; John 18:36; Luke 5:31-32; John 1:14; Galatians 4:4-5; Ecclesiastes 7:10; and more.

      <title>Joy to the World</title>
      <description>Explore why real joy is more than a seasonal feeling and why it holds steady even when life is heavy. We begin with Luke 2 and the coming of Jesus, then connect the words of Isaac Watts’ hymn to the Bible’s picture of Christ as King and Savior. From there, we walk through several passages that show where the Lord places lasting joy: in His presence, in doing what is right, in worship and praise, in the strength He provides, in repentance, in the fruit of the Spirit, and in the hope of heaven.
This message is also a reminder that joy is not the same as pretending everything is fine. The New Testament shows believers rejoicing while still facing trials, because joy is rooted in the Lord, not in perfect circumstances. If you have been stuck in complaint, carrying bitterness, or feeling drained, this lesson points back to the kind of joy Scripture calls us to pursue through faith, prayer, gratitude, and obedience to Jesus.</description>

      <title>God’s Unexpected Love</title>
      <description>Christmas can get loud and busy fast, and it’s easy to miss what it’s really pointing to. This lesson centers on one simple truth: God showed His unexpected love in Jesus Christ. Using Ephesians 3:14-21, we think through the width, length, depth, and height of Christ’s love, a love that surpasses knowledge but can still be truly known because God revealed it to us. We also talk about why many people in Jesus’ day expected a political rescuer, while Jesus spoke of a spiritual kingdom (John 18:36) and came to save in a deeper way than anyone expected.
If you feel worn down, guilty, or unsure where you stand with God, this message points you back to the heart of Christmas. God gave His Son for the world (John 3:16), and that love calls for a response. We want to believe Jesus, turn back to God, confess Christ, and be baptized into Him for the forgiveness of sins (Acts 2:38; Romans 10:9-10; Galatians 3:27).

      <title>O Holy Night</title>
      <description>“O Holy Night” is more than a favorite Christmas song. It preaches. In this lesson from Matthew 2:1-12, we follow the wise men as they seek the newborn King, and we connect the song’s three verses to three gospel truths: Christ’s appearing gives the soul its worth, His coming invites us into friendship with God, and His discipleship brings real freedom from sin.</description>

      <title>Christmas: God’s Unexpected Plan</title>
      <description>What if Christmas is God’s most unexpected plan showing up in an ordinary town and an ordinary life? In Luke 1:26-38 we meet Gabriel, a startled teenager named Mary, and the promise of a King whose kingdom will never end. We look at the angel’s greeting, the call to fear not, the name Jesus, the forever throne of David, and the overshadowing work of the Holy Spirit. Mary’s simple words, “Let it be to me according to your word,” still teach us how to trust today.
Scriptures: Luke 1:26-38, 2 Samuel 7:12-16, Isaiah 7:14, Isaiah 9:6-7, with a preview in Luke 1:46-55. Great anyone hungry for hope rooted in God’s promises.

      <title>Silent Night</title>
      <description>A simple Christmas message with the Bible open to Luke 2 and John 1. We walk through Silent Night in three parts: the calm in Bethlehem, the angel’s good news to the shepherds, and the light of redeeming grace in Jesus Christ. We briefly note how the hymn began with Joseph Mohr and Franz Gruber, clear up common nativity mix ups, and invite each listener to respond to the gospel.
Scriptures: Luke 2:1-20, Matthew 2:1-12, John 1:1-14, Isaiah 9:2, 6-7, Titus 2:11.
How to respond: Hear the word (Romans 10:17), believe in Jesus (John 8:24), repent of sins (Acts 2:38), confess Christ (Romans 10:9-10), be baptized for the forgiveness of sins (Mark 16:16; Acts 22:16), and live faithfully (Revelation 2:10).</description>

      <title>Sunday Evening Q&amp;A #5</title>
      <description>Some questions are too real to ignore.
In this Q&amp;A lesson we wrestle with three of the hardest:
1. What if human limitation is not failure, but part of God’s design?
2. How should Christians think about grief when the pain just will not go away?
3. What does the Bible say about domestic abuse and a spouse’s obligation to an abusive partner?
Drawing from Romans 8-11, Psalms, the life of Jesus, and key Old and New Testament texts, we look at how God uses our limitations, how He meets us in seasons of deep sorrow, and why abuse is always sin and never God’s will for a marriage. This message speaks especially to those who have stayed in unsafe situations because they believed God required it. If you carry guilt or confusion about grief, weakness, or abuse, this study is meant to help you see God’s goodness and His heart for your safety and healing.
Passages referenced include: 1 Peter 3:15; Romans 8:18-23; Romans 9:21-23; Romans 11:32; Genesis 6:6; Psalms 78 and 95; Isaiah 63:10; Mark 3:5; Ephesians 4:30; various Old Testament accounts of violence and injustice; and additional texts on marriage, justice, and protection of the vulnerable.</description>

      <title>The Way</title>
      <description>Early Christians are described in Acts as followers of “the Way,” and that title still speaks today. In this message we explore how Luke uses that term, why names matter for the church, and how Jesus is not just a label but the path we walk. We trace seven mile markers from Scripture: Teaching, Jesus, Salvation, God’s Way, Peace, Truth, and Righteousness. Key texts include Acts 9, 19, 22, and 24 with John 14:6 at the center. We clear up common misunderstandings about ekklesia, connect the “Two Ways” theme from the Old Testament to the early church, and offer simple next steps for entering and walking the Way through faith in Christ, repentance, and baptism. This study serves anyone who wants to follow Jesus on the narrow road and live out the life of the church of Christ in everyday discipleship.

      <title>Sunday Evening Q&amp;A #3</title>
      <description>In this Q&amp;A message we walk through 1 John 4:1–6 and learn four clear filters for spiritual discernment Christology, Apostolic Witness, Gospel of grace, and Spirit-formed Fruit. We then offer a simple dashboard for new believers to notice drift and respond with confession, community, and hope. Finally, we address seasons when faith grows quiet and show from Psalm 22, Luke 24:44, and Hebrews 13:5 how God is not absent but inviting deeper trust. Scriptures include 1 John 4:1–6, 1 John 2:3–6, 1 John 4:7–12, Galatians 1:8–9, Matthew 7:15–20, Hebrews 10:24–25, Psalm 13, and Job 13:15. Practical steps, memorable illustrations, and a Christ-centered call to respond round out the session.</description>

      <description>Bring your Bible and join us for a practical Q&amp;A. We open 1 Corinthians 5, John 9, 1 John 4, and Revelation 20. Together we look at church discipline that heals rather than harms, what Scripture does and does not say about cremation, a simple map of God’s covenants from Genesis to Revelation, the meaning of the Great White Throne, whether God hears when we are in sin, and how to test the spirits with confidence in Christ. This is a warm, Scripture-first study with honest &amp;quot;I don’t know moments&amp;quot; that can lead to deeper faith.</description>
