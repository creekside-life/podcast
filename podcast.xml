      <title>Church Leader’s Wives: Must Be Temperate</title>
      <description>Church leaders are not the only people called to live with steady minds and steady hands. Their spouses often set the tone. This lesson on 1 Timothy 3:11 traces the Greek word nēphalios and shows how true temperance takes shape through four everyday practices: abnegate unhealthy desires, self-regulate emotions, moderate opinions, and cultivate a sedate, clear head for sound judgment. We draw from ancient priestly rules, Proverbs level wisdom, and a modern cautionary tale to show why clear thinking matters in every home and congregation. You will find practical steps to guard your heart, support your spouse, and strengthen your witness. Ideal for elders, deacons, ministry couples, and anyone who wants self-control rooted in the Spirit instead of sheer willpower. Watch and use these habits to bring calm credibility to your family and your church.</description>

      <title>Shepherding: Qualifications for Elders #3</title>
      <description>Elders are shepherds, not corporate board members. This lesson walks through 1 Peter 5:1-4 and highlights four traits every church leader needs.
- Lead by tending, feeding, and guarding the flock.
- Watch willingly, never for dishonest gain.
- Serve because you want to, not because you must.
- Model humility by working beside the sheep, not above them.
Understand why Peter calls Jesus the Chief Shepherd and how that truth shapes everyday leadership. Whether you are already an elder, preparing for the role, or simply curious about biblical leadership, this teaching offers clear guidance rooted in Scripture and real-life experience.</description>

      <title>Shepherding: Qualifications for Elders #2</title>
      <description>What makes a man truly qualified to shepherd God’s people? In this eye-opening message from Titus 1:5-9, we unpack four essential categories of elder qualifications: those he must meet, embody, avoid, and consistently live out. From faithful children to being blameless, from not being quick-tempered to holding fast to sound doctrine — these Spirit-led traits guide our congregational selection process. Explore how Paul aligned his teachings to Titus and Timothy and what that means for our churches today. Includes practical insights, historical references, and a heartfelt call to serve not for glory, but for love of the Lord.</description>

Ideal for anyone studying elder or deacon qualifications, women’s discipleship, or the heartbeat of healthy church leadership.</description>

      <title>Three Kinds of Transformation</title>
      <description>Three pivotal moments shape every believer: the Spirit-powered new birth, the ongoing renewal of the mind, and the future resurrection glory promised in Christ. Walk through Jeremiah 17, Romans 12, and Philippians 3 to see how God moves us from veil to vision, from world-shaped to Word-shaped, and ultimately from mortality to immortality. Along the way we test counterfeit “transformations,” trace stories of genuine change, and celebrate the liberty found where “the Lord is the Spirit.” Perfect for Bible class prep, small-group discussion, or anyone craving a deeper grasp of conversion, sanctification, and hope beyond the grave.</description>
