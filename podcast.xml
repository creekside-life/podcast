      <title>Love in Action</title>
      <description>Generosity isn’t an optional upgrade for disciples—Jesus says it’s the family trait (John 13:35). In this message we unpack Deuteronomy 15, Galatians 6, and 1 John 3 to show why real faith opens its hand to every neighbor. You’ll learn how to spot true “needs,” guard your heart from stinginess, and keep giving even when the needs never end. Stay to the end for a practical challenge that will stretch your faith and soften your heart.
Speaker: Gionte Solomon</description>

      <title>Family Curses</title>

If you’re ready to replace inherited pain with promised blessing, grab a Bible, open your notes app, and join us.

      <title>Holy Ambition</title>
      <description>From spiritual death to a life overflowing with purpose, Ephesians 2:1–10 charts the breathtaking rescue story of every believer. This sermon walks through four pivotal moments: our revival from ruin, elevation by mercy, redemption through grace, and restoration for a life that matters. Far from a surface-level message, it presses into the tension between our past rebellion and God&amp;apos;s relentless kindness, calling every hearer to personal commitment and courageous faith.
For anyone feeling stuck, unworthy, or unsure of their purpose—this is the wake-up call your soul’s been waiting for.

      <title>Hope that Surpasses all Understanding</title>
      <description>In a world weighed down by tragedy, personal pain, and uncertainty, how do we find the strength to keep going? This powerful sermon takes us from historical heartbreak to personal loss, from the storms of life to the still waters of faith. We explore events like the Oklahoma City bombing, Columbine, and the Boston Marathon attack—not to recount horror, but to illuminate the deeper question: Where is our hope when the world breaks? Anchored in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, this message draws from Peter&amp;apos;s stormy walk (Matthew 14), Thomas’s doubt (John 20), and the empty tomb (Matthew 28), reminding us that faith isn&amp;apos;t about seeing—it&amp;apos;s about focusing on the One who saves when we sink.
Through raw storytelling, biblical truth, and emotional testimony, this sermon offers a heartfelt call to find your 903 moment—when healing begins. If you’ve ever felt like Peter drowning in fear or Thomas drowning in doubt, this is a message for you.

      <title>Hello darkness, my old friend</title>
      <description>&amp;quot;Why Is Psalm 88 So Dark?&amp;quot;
When the Bible includes a chapter with no resolution, no hope, and only darkness—what does that say about God&amp;apos;s understanding of our pain? This sermon walks through Psalm 88 and Job to explore how even faithful believers experienced spiritual isolation. You&amp;apos;ll hear a powerful testimony of surviving ICU isolation, gain insight into lament as worship, and discover how Christ entered our darkness so we would never be alone again. Real talk, raw faith, and eternal hope—even when you can’t see it.

      <itunes:summary>Are there real contradictions in the Bible—or just misunderstood contexts? In this thought-provoking sermon, Marvin Phillips addresses skeptics’ top claims, including God’s justice in war, the Bible&amp;apos;s stance on slavery, differing Gospel timelines of Christ’s crucifixion, and supposed scientific errors in Scripture. Through in-depth scriptural comparisons and historical insight, this message challenges doubts and reinforces trust in God&amp;apos;s word as consistent, just, and true. A must-watch for anyone wrestling with Bible difficulties or seeking a stronger foundation for faith in the 21st century.
