      <title>God’s Unexpected Love</title>
      <description>Christmas can get loud and busy fast, and it’s easy to miss what it’s really pointing to. This lesson centers on one simple truth: God showed His unexpected love in Jesus Christ. Using Ephesians 3:14-21, we think through the width, length, depth, and height of Christ’s love, a love that surpasses knowledge but can still be truly known because God revealed it to us. We also talk about why many people in Jesus’ day expected a political rescuer, while Jesus spoke of a spiritual kingdom (John 18:36) and came to save in a deeper way than anyone expected.
If you feel worn down, guilty, or unsure where you stand with God, this message points you back to the heart of Christmas. God gave His Son for the world (John 3:16), and that love calls for a response. We want to believe Jesus, turn back to God, confess Christ, and be baptized into Him for the forgiveness of sins (Acts 2:38; Romans 10:9-10; Galatians 3:27).

      <title>O Holy Night</title>
      <description>“O Holy Night” is more than a favorite Christmas song. It preaches. In this lesson from Matthew 2:1-12, we follow the wise men as they seek the newborn King, and we connect the song’s three verses to three gospel truths: Christ’s appearing gives the soul its worth, His coming invites us into friendship with God, and His discipleship brings real freedom from sin.</description>

      <title>Christmas: God’s Unexpected Plan</title>
      <description>What if Christmas is God’s most unexpected plan showing up in an ordinary town and an ordinary life? In Luke 1:26-38 we meet Gabriel, a startled teenager named Mary, and the promise of a King whose kingdom will never end. We look at the angel’s greeting, the call to fear not, the name Jesus, the forever throne of David, and the overshadowing work of the Holy Spirit. Mary’s simple words, “Let it be to me according to your word,” still teach us how to trust today.
Scriptures: Luke 1:26-38, 2 Samuel 7:12-16, Isaiah 7:14, Isaiah 9:6-7, with a preview in Luke 1:46-55. Great anyone hungry for hope rooted in God’s promises.

      <title>Silent Night</title>
      <description>A simple Christmas message with the Bible open to Luke 2 and John 1. We walk through Silent Night in three parts: the calm in Bethlehem, the angel’s good news to the shepherds, and the light of redeeming grace in Jesus Christ. We briefly note how the hymn began with Joseph Mohr and Franz Gruber, clear up common nativity mix ups, and invite each listener to respond to the gospel.
Scriptures: Luke 2:1-20, Matthew 2:1-12, John 1:1-14, Isaiah 9:2, 6-7, Titus 2:11.
How to respond: Hear the word (Romans 10:17), believe in Jesus (John 8:24), repent of sins (Acts 2:38), confess Christ (Romans 10:9-10), be baptized for the forgiveness of sins (Mark 16:16; Acts 22:16), and live faithfully (Revelation 2:10).</description>

      <title>Sunday Evening Q&amp;A #5</title>
      <description>Some questions are too real to ignore.
In this Q&amp;A lesson we wrestle with three of the hardest:
1. What if human limitation is not failure, but part of God’s design?
2. How should Christians think about grief when the pain just will not go away?
3. What does the Bible say about domestic abuse and a spouse’s obligation to an abusive partner?
Drawing from Romans 8-11, Psalms, the life of Jesus, and key Old and New Testament texts, we look at how God uses our limitations, how He meets us in seasons of deep sorrow, and why abuse is always sin and never God’s will for a marriage. This message speaks especially to those who have stayed in unsafe situations because they believed God required it. If you carry guilt or confusion about grief, weakness, or abuse, this study is meant to help you see God’s goodness and His heart for your safety and healing.
Passages referenced include: 1 Peter 3:15; Romans 8:18-23; Romans 9:21-23; Romans 11:32; Genesis 6:6; Psalms 78 and 95; Isaiah 63:10; Mark 3:5; Ephesians 4:30; various Old Testament accounts of violence and injustice; and additional texts on marriage, justice, and protection of the vulnerable.</description>

      <title>The Way</title>
      <description>Early Christians are described in Acts as followers of “the Way,” and that title still speaks today. In this message we explore how Luke uses that term, why names matter for the church, and how Jesus is not just a label but the path we walk. We trace seven mile markers from Scripture: Teaching, Jesus, Salvation, God’s Way, Peace, Truth, and Righteousness. Key texts include Acts 9, 19, 22, and 24 with John 14:6 at the center. We clear up common misunderstandings about ekklesia, connect the “Two Ways” theme from the Old Testament to the early church, and offer simple next steps for entering and walking the Way through faith in Christ, repentance, and baptism. This study serves anyone who wants to follow Jesus on the narrow road and live out the life of the church of Christ in everyday discipleship.
