uh this is the first time I've stood up
to teach a class preach a lesson in over
a year uh I'm going to try it I going to
give it a shot see if I can stand up and
do this uh but uh God bless you for
being here and I thank our young brother
for uh reading the scripture uh some of
you have been in my class on the core
values of Jesus on Wednesday night and
so you're going to recall some of the
concepts that we talked about and I am
going to uh share with some of you
tonight um some of those Concepts in
this class I want to do a deeper dive
and approach it from a new angle but it
shows how these ideas continue to evolve
and remain significant in this current
context of the requirements of
discipleship the 22 and one now I'm
going to explain to you a little bit
later on what the 2 two and one uh is
and what I'm talking about but when I
talk about the requirements of
discipleship what I'm what I'm talking
about the 2 two and one I'm going to
give you two
prerequisites for discipleship I'm going
to give you two transitional
requirements for
discipleship then I'm going to share
with you one
biblical
example of
discipleship now this is not the first
time I preach this lesson I preach this
lesson at Bel ch's almost 13 years ago
but I want to tell you why I picked it
tonight you know uh when we said that
all of you know the the leaders the
elders and deacons would preach on
Sunday night Brothers I had no idea
brothers and sisters I had no idea what
I was going to preach about brother Rex
called me on one Saturday and said
brother Henson can you take January
26 and immediately I knew that this
lesson was the one that I was going to
preach you see 14 years ago my brother
and I were in discussion about
discipleship you know he was a preacher
had a congregation there at Chattanooga
tennessy and he and I were talking about
discipleship and this lesson was born
from that discussion those
discussions he's going on now passed
away and
uh I think it was March of
2019 but today is his birthday and so
when he said January
26 immediately I said that's the one I
think it is something that blesses all
of God's people so um I think it is
appropriate considering where we are now
and what we're trying to to do in our
community
in Acts 11: 26 Jesus says this or the
scripture says
this and when he had found him he
brought him in unto
Antioch and it came to pass that a whole
year they assembled themselves with the
church and talked much
people and the
disciples were called
Christian at
Antioch you know not today we have a
tendency to want to
differentiate between Christian and
disciple but beloved they are one of the
selfsame thing all of
us are Disciples of our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ now I want to ask a
question and some of you uh who have
been in my class you've heard me ask
this or make this statement but for
those of you who have not want to ask
this question and it's a trick question
so to speak what is the greatest ability
required of disciples or Christian
people is it
preaching is it teaching loving
others perhaps praying or singing or
maybe it's selfless
giving all of these things are
good but none of them are the answer
that I'm looking for this evening you
see
the greatest ability required of
Disciples of Christian
people is
availability you see God can do all of
these things and he can do even more
through us but in order for God to do
these things through us we must first
make ourselves
available to him before he can do these
things through us we must allow him to
do some things to us
now what
is a
disciple you hear some that say well a
disciple is a follower a follower of
Jesus that's
true I don't like that
definition some say he's a a disciple is
a
student that's true
too I don't like that definition
either and there are those who say that
perhaps a better term would be a
Apprentice an apprentice I like that you
see because if you had a Baker's
Apprentice one day that Apprentice would
become a
baker if you had a a carpenter's
Apprentice that Carpenter's Apprentice
is expected one day to become a
carpenter it is the intent
of the
discipl to shape his followers into a
mirror image of himself Jesus says this
in Luke
6:40 the disciple is not above his
master but everyone that is perfect or
complete shall be as his
master in Matthew
10 verse 25
Jesus says this it is
enough for the disciple that he be as
his master and the servant as his Lord
you see all of us who have named The
Sweet name of Jesus who have been
baptized into the body of
Christ God has expect us to be like his
son God is working on all of us shaping
and molding us into the image of his
dear
son
so I guess you figured out by now we're
going to be talking about discipleship
now I want to read the passage that was
read into your hearing again just for
the sake of
emphasis there are a couple of points I
want to uh emphasize here and I want you
to bear with me as I do that in Matthew
4:1 17-22 which is so beautifully read
it says that from the time that Jesus
began to preach and say repent for the
Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and Jesus
walking by the Sea of Galilee saw two
Brethren Simon called Peter Andrew his
brother casting Nets into the sea for
they were
Fishers and he said unto them follow me
and I will make you Fishers of
Men and they
straightway left their Nets
and followed
him and going on from then he saw two
other Brethren James the son of Zebedee
and John's brother in the ship with
Zebedee their father mending their Nets
and he called them and they
immediately left the ship and their
father and followed
him before Jesus began
his Galilean
Ministry he took it upon himself to call
some men and asked them to make
themselves available to
God that was their call to
discipleship and I want to share with
you based upon this passage that we just
read the first
prerequisite an immediate
response when God God calls answer when
Jesus called answer respond tomorrow is
not promised today is the day of
salvation today is the day that we need
to
respond straight way he says in verse 20
immediately in verse
22 this example of answering the call to
discipleship emphasizes the need for
immediate and total
commitment to follow
Jesus it shows the fact that they left
their Nets even willing to leave the
father to follow Jesus it shows that
they were willing to leave behind the
former
life the former identities to follow
Christ Jesus and that's the call for all
of
us when he calls us from the world Leave
the World Behind and follow Christ Jesus
that's what he's looking for us to
do second
prerequisite and we find the second PR
prerequisite in Luke Chapter
n
now the landing verse will be verses 23-
26 but let me just kind of give you a
backdrop of what's going on in Luke 9
Jesus sent his disciples out to preach
the kingdom and they went preaching and
healing
everywhere Herod heard of this and was
perplexed he thought that John whom he
had beheaded was risen
again you go down a little bit further
the disciples came back and shared with
Jesus what had occurred while they were
out there uh uh uh spreading the word
the good news of the Kingdom as Christ
had sent him to do
they saw Jesus doing great works healing
and feel feeding the multitudes they
expressed their faith that he is in the
Christ
indeed and Jesus speaking of the
suffering and eventual death that he was
going to
encounter and then in Luke chapter 9
veres 23-
26 he said to
them if any man
will come after
me let him deny
himself take up his cross
daily and follow me for whosoever was
saved his life shall lose
it but whosoever will lose his life for
my sake the same will save
it but what is a man Advantage if he
gain the the whole
world and lose himself or be cast
away but whosoever shall be ashamed of
me and of my words of him shall the son
of man be ashamed when he shall come
into his own
glory and in his
fathers and of the Holy
Angels now let a man deny himself is
what he
says that's your second
prerequisite
self-denial now let's be
honest self is a pretty hard thing to
overcome all
right the truth of the matter is that
there are many who have named The Name
of
Jesus and
self is coming before the Lord that's
the reality of the situation all
right but a message to them is that God
is a jealous
God Thou shalt have no other gods before
me he says in Exodus 20 and3 and
Deuteronomy
6:15 the first and great commandment
Jesus says is to love the Lord thy God
with all thy heart with all thy soul
with all thy mind and with all thy
strength what that means is that
everything that we do in a relational in
relationships
predicated on our love for
God we can't love one another and not
love God and and I've said this in in in
in uh my classes and I say it again
beloved we don't know how to love one
another I use this example in a class I
got four kids and not a single one of
them came into this world loving
me they had to learn to love me based
upon what I did for
them the affection and love I show them
they learn to reciprocate and respond
accordingly and show me
love that's why John says we love God
why because he first loved
us but if we love God
he teaches us to love one another
because the word
says okay that we are to obbey his
Commandments and in his Commandments he
teaches us what love looks
like Christ Jesus showed us what love
looks like and his willingness to lay
his life down for
us here's my reality reality check I had
to give myself a reality
check years
ago I had to ask myself the
question and you might want to do it
too what is your treasure
L I asked myself that question you see
Jesus says where a man's treasure is
that's where his heart is ask yourself a
question and give an honest
response what do you spend most of your
time
doing and why
who or what occupies your thoughts most
of the
time what do you talk about when you're
around your friends the majority of the
time brother Willie Smith said a few
weeks ago in his class he said you know
there are 24 hours in a day 16 waking
hours how many are spent on Kingdom
Business the things that glorify God
how many hours I spent on things that
glorify
self Jesus says You must deny
self pick up the
cross and follow
him the
cross
bear our cross each of
us is asked to Bear our cross for
Christ denying self means being
willing to give it all to the
Lord I think that's appropriate
especially when it we're trying to to
launch a stewardship
campaign denying self and bearing cross
means willing to give it all to him all
right the
cross is not the Christian
flag
okay but it's a symbol of
death and
suffering first century Christianity
flourished we know that when we read the
book of Acts we see that how passing and
and sharing the gospel I mean it they
were on fire for the
Lord
even
despite the great persecution
that they encountered for doing
so They Carried the cross for
Christ we had a a meet and greet
today and Elders Dwight myself and
others we were talking about military
service you know and the young man that
we were talking about hey look he's
military too he's a
soldier I like soldiers we got a lot of
of soldiers of people that were in the
military in this
room you know the one thing about
soldiers that I
like when they're
called they understand they have to put
it all on the line for the
cause that's what the disciple is
required to
do put it all on the line for Christ
Jesus that's what it means to bear our
cross for Christ
Jesus for the cause of
Christ
now in Luke 9 verse
57-62 the scripture
reads and it came to
pass that as they went in the way a
certain man said unto him Lord
Lord I will follow you wherever you
go anywhere Lord I'll follow
you and Jesus said unto him foxes have
holes and birds of the air have nests
but the son of man have not where to lay
his
head and he said to another follow me
but he said Lord suffer me first
to go Bury My
Father and Jesus said unto
him let the dead bury the
dead but go thou and preach the kingdom
of
God and another also said Lord I will
follow
you but let me first go bid them
farewell which are at home at my
house and Jesus said unto to him no
man having put his hand to the
plow and looking
back is fit for the kingdom of
God I appreciate this example because to
show something and I want to share this
with
you we will
never be true Disciples of our Lord and
savior as long long as we keep coming up
with reasons not to
be and these people were looking for
excuses and reason why they couldn't
follow when Jesus
called you
see when God calls us when Jesus calls
as the original disciples showed an
immediate response that's what he's
calling us to
Follow You
Lord I follow
you wherever you want me to
go I will
follow you know there's a
song that he used to
saying anywhere you know you send me
Lord
yeah Lord send me oh yeah that that's
that's what God wants us he call us and
he wants us to respond immediately
now I want to talk to you about two
transitional
requirements I just shared with you two
prerequisites okay that is an immediate
response and
self-denial want to give you now two
transitional
requirements all right
now if you've ever been in a class
you've heard be referred to this passage
because quite honestly it's one of my
favorite cuz I meditate on and whenever
I get a chance to share with someone
what Romans 121 and2 says it speaks
volumes to
me when we process
it it's life
changing what Paul is asking in Romans
12 1-2
he says I beseech you
Brethren he said I beg you Brethren I'm
begging
you by the mercies of God that you
present your bodies a Living
Sacrifice
holy acceptable unto God which is your
reasonable service
and be not conformed to the world he
says but be ye
transformed by the renewing of your
mind that you might prove what is that
good and acceptable and perfect
will of
God first he
says present your
bodies I want us to understand something
here when he says present your
body he is not just talking about this
shell that we live
in but he's talking about the shell and
everything in it just your spirit and
soul as
well present your whole
man to
him as a
living self
sacrifice holy and acceptable to
God now those of you who have been in my
class you've heard me say this but the
conversation when I told you that my
brother and I collaborated on this
lesson I remember his words so clearly
he said Lord that's a powerful powerful
comment
present and I remember closely because
it was December 2012
and we were talking about
it it
wasn't far from
Christmas but he mentioned presenting
gifts and how rude it would be to
present and then take it
back so when we give it to God give it
to him give ourselves to God as a Living
Sacrifice I'm Yours
Lord I'm
Yours I've denied myself and I'm giving
myself to
you oh that's another song that comes to
mind I
Surrender I surrender
all there was another one I Give Myself
Away
to you
Lord that's what God is saying and Paul
is saying present yourself as a Living
Sacrifice it ain't me to live no longer
Lord I'm it's you I've got to have this
mind this attitude that I'm going to
live for
you it's transitional
requirement if we're going to be like
Jesus we have to have that
mindset that we're all in and we give
ourselves to
him second transitional
requirement be
transformed by the renewing of your
mind I share
this every time I get into that
particular passage two words
and scripture two Greek
words
transform there's one
word
metamorpho and the other word is meta
schema
tiu that word meta schema tiu is where
we get our word schematic and you know
what a schematic is it's a
pattern it's a pattern you know uh
when you have a pattern if you want to
make all you have to do is imitate the
pattern you know I we may have some
seamstress in here I my mama used to be
a seamstress she used to make her
clothes or whatever she'd get a
pattern and if she wanted to to uh make
a dress she just trace the pattern and
cut it
out God is not asking us this is the
scripture of a a a a word that should
not even enter our minds when it comes
to transformation or transforming
ourselves of being transformed that word
is used in 2 Corinthians chapter
11: 13 and
15 and this is what how the Bible uses
that term in uh
scripture it says for such are false
Apostles this is what Paul is writing
he's talking about false Apostles here
deceitful workers
transforming themselves into an apostle
of
Christ and no Marvel for Satan himself
is
transformed into an angel of
Light therefore it is no great thing if
his ministers also be
transformed as the Ministers of
righteousness whose ends shall be
according to the their
works you see that meta schema tiu that
pattern that we're talking
about these people that Paul is writing
about
here know what Apostles look
like
okay what they're supposed to
do what they're supposed to
say so they transform themselves to
appear
as
Apostles but inside they are the same
Children of the devil that Paul writes
about here in 2 Corinthians chapter
11 you
see bringing
home I ain't talking about nobody but
the reality exists and we've all seen it
you know there are folks who have gone
down in the water that show up on Sunday
morning that are the
same after being baptized as they were
before that there's no
change no change
whatsoever they just dressed the little
nice but it's the same within the heart
that has not been and we've experienced
it if you've been in the church long
enough you've seen it
because they have torn up
churches I've seen it
myself but that's not what God is asking
for to
appear as a Christian he wants us to
be
Christians you know there's another
group too that and I've seen it too
that what I used to call the church
police I don't know if you that's that's
my term the church police I'm going to
tell you what the church police is the
church police is that person that grabs
hold of a new convert that just come out
of the water and trying to do the right
thing and then they take them when that
new convert makes a mistake or or or
maybe uh says something or does
something they don't like will dress
them up and down and say you should say
this you shouldn't do this this is what
you need to look like la la la la la la
in other words giving them the pattern
that's the church police God is not
asking for that
either what he wants
is
metamorph that type of
transformation if you have a Bible turn
to Matthew chapter 17 veres 1 and two
and I want you to see the difference
because the word transformed is used
here as well
Matthew writes he says and after six
days Jesus taketh Peter James and John
his brother and bringeth them up into a
high mountain
apart and was
transfigured before
them and his face did shine as the sun
and His Garment or his rainment was
white as the light
in that
passage the word metamorph
you
is
translated as
transfigure it is the exact same word
that Paul uses when he says be
transformed by the renewing of your
mind now why did Jesus appear as this
this light and why why did his face
shine like the sun it was not because he
patterned himself it because it was
because of the god in
him was coming
out and so what Paul is saying in Romans
121:2 you be transformed you'll be
changed from the
inside out
Inside Out Beloved the only way that can
happen is if we submit to the teachings
of our
Master obedience to God obedience to the
Lord through our obedience to him and
the power of the Holy Spirit we will be
transformed be transformed let God renew
our minds get rid of this old man and
become this new Man created in the image
of
Christ we have to do
that that's what God
desires now
one biblical
example here's the biblical
example Philippians
2
5-1 because
as we
journey as we follow we're following in
the footsteps of Jesus that's who we're
following and Philippians 2 5-11 shows
what Christ was all
about scripture says let this mind the
renewed mind this is what the Mind
should look like that we should have let
this mind be in you which was also in
Christ
Jesus who being in the form of God
thought it not robbery to be equal with
God but made himself of no reputation
and took upon him the form of a
servant and was made in the likeness of
men and being found in the fashion as a
man he humbled himself and became
obedient unto
death even the death on the cross and I
want you to bear with me now okay what
we talk about
this here we find Jesus
thought it that robbery to be equal with
God took upon himself the form of a
servant now wait a minute what does that
show
humility there is a word that should be
in all of our vocabularies
is people of
God humility
the Greek
word
is let's see here I'm trying to remember
what it the exact word but what it
literally means is that I
submit and place
myself beneath
another now this is God doing
this and becoming a servant to man
becoming a servant to the man he created
and then still he became
obedient even unto
death and he
obeyed Jesus said in John 14 I believe
it's around 2930 when people were were
he was getting ready to go to the Cross
you know I always say you know people
would say well he he went to the Cross
because he love me well that's that's
that's that's probably
true he did tell his disciples Greater
Love had no man than this that a man lay
down his life for his friend but he said
you are my friends too if you do what I
say so he was speaking to
them but what about that person that was
beating him with that cat of Ninetails
ripping the flesh from his back you see
he died for them too
but what was the impetus for him dying
for them was it because he loved them so
much I don't know all I know is what he
says in John
1429
30 he told his
disciples I'm doing
this because I love the father
and as he gives me a commandment I do
it following his
example the way he submitted in
obedience to his father even when it was
difficult we know he didn't want to
die he prayed that he didn't have to
bear that cross yet still he submitted
and was obedient unto death of the
Cross now if we're following in the
footsteps of Jesus if we are a follower
if we are student and even if we are
Apprentice we should
learn from
that said learn of
me and if we learn from him likewise
even when it's difficult we obey
submit submit to
him
that's the
example that's the example for
us the one biblical
model is Christ Jesus our
lord let me say this as I prepare
her
clothes I don't believe in
coincidences I believe
that where there is an honest
Seeker you see I don't know everybody's
status in here I don't know how many
people have been baptized I don't know
if if there's someone that is on the
verge of making a decision that have not
made it yet I don't
know but I believe that wherever there
is an honest
Seeker you know Jesus himself says seek
and you shall
find where there's an honest Seeker I
believe that God makes way for an honest
teacher to find his way there to lead
that person in a way they would have him
go if anything shows me that acts
chapter 8 shows me
that mhm with Philip and the
UN a person who was in the word
searching and the Holy Spirit turn him
around turn Philip around and says go
join yourself to that
Chariot Philip taught him what thus
sayith the
Lord if you're
not a
member of the Lord's
Church Jesus is saying to you the same
thing he said to those 12 that he called
follow
me follow
me and as the Hebrew writer says
today when you hear his
voice Harden not your
heart today is the day immediate
response because
tomorrow it's not even
promised you answer the call
when he's calling you this is how you
answer you believe that Jesus is the
only begotten Son of God that he was
crucified dead he was placed in a tomb
and Rose from the grave seen among men
and ascended high and is now at the
right hand of
God you confess
this before
men confess him this
day to night and other opportunities you
have you continue to confess your faith
in that gospel
message you repent of your
sins be
baptized and God has promised you the
gift of the Holy
Spirit the other thing
too is to be thou faithful unto death
and you will receive the Crown of Life
that fadeth not
away now perhaps you
are a
member but you've not been the disciple
you think you should
be perhaps self we talk about how
powerful self is has gotten in the
way perhaps you've
been
guilty of the metamorph metema
T faking it along the
way but
now you want to make it
right you want to make it right and say
Lord I'm
yours I'm
yours I serve
you and none
other if that is your choice tonight
either of those
options the Lord is
waiting the Lord is
waiting there's a passage in
Revelations that I
love and I often Envision it this way
you
know
behold I stand at the door and knock If
any man hear my voice and open the door
I would come into him and I would Sumit
him he was me
now I believe somewhere
tonight maybe in some heart maybe even
in this room Jesus is
knocking the question though will you
let him
in that's the big
question the requirements of
discipleship 2 two and one the lesson is
yours
