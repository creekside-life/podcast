you know life is a risk I mean if you
think you can get out of risk you know
uh you're in the middle of risk all the
time many good people though are at risk
of losing their families and then then
they don't even know it they think
they're doing the exact right things and
they're at risk of losing their family
someone said you can be very responsible
but if anything goes wrong in a
relationship you can be blamed as the
one responsible
so just because you are being
responsible does not mean that you won't
be
blamed there's a one person asked this
question if marriage is Grand what is
divorce and the answer came back it's
about 5 to 10
grand if you don't have any money a
divorce is not your
solution the Bible teaches that families
are supposed to try to stay together
Matthew 19:6 says what God has joined
together let not
man separate 1 Corinthians chapter 7:
101 says a wife is not to depart from
her husband and then it says and a
husband is not to divorce his wife so
that's
true but does happen does
that I want to give you nine of the most
common risk factors for divorce okay can
I do that for you give you nine this is
actually from uh San Francisco attorney
at La Gerard Gerard uh
Fone and uh I don't think I've ever seen
a more s succinct list than this I'll
explain a little bit as we go
extramarital Affairs or lack of
commitment that's in 60 to 70% of all
divorces your parents got divorced it's
a high probability you will I'm sorry I
don't mean to give you bad news and
we're not talking about your adoptive
parents we're talking about your
biological parents what happened to your
biological parents is where the odds are
on that I'm sorry I don't mean any
disrespect to adoption I'm simply trying
to point out that it is related to
biology to some degree apparently
different drinking habits and that
sounds strange uh I mean if you drink uh
Dr Pepper and your wife drinks diet Dr
Pepper we're not talking about
that but we'll tell you that between 45
to 55% get divorced who just simply have
after their 9th anniversary uh as a
result of different drinking habits
interesting hey uh
35% divorce rate for those who have the
not don't have the same drinking
patterns getting married too young or
waiting too late if you get married in
your teens or your very early 20s which
of course is what I did uh you're you're
a high probability of a divorce if you
wait until you're after 32 you have a
higher divorce probability somewhere
between that sweet spot of about 22 and
32 are the ideal ages apparently for
Success uh you spend
$20,000 or more on your wedding it
increases the likelihood of a
divorce I hear some of you going
H the Emory University did a study on
that and who spent 20,000 plus were 3.5
times more likely to get a divorce than
those who spent $1,000 or less that's a
shocker isn't it especially since you
can't even rent a hall sometimes for
Lessing 20,000 around there uh less
income or a as well as less education so
in other words if you didn't get a
four-year degree you're more likely to
get a divorce than you are if you got
one if you aren't making very much money
you live on a lower income because the
difficulties there you're more likely to
get a divorce than you would be if you
were making a little more so less income
um and less education uh you live uh
together before you were married a lot
of people would think that would enhance
your marital prospects but it actually
degrades your marital prospects you're
more likely to get a divorce uh some
connect it to religious matters some
argue that that's not what it is but I I
lean into the idea of trying to do right
things um so if you live together before
you got married you're more likely to
get a divorced poor communic
is another risk factor some people just
have never learned to talk how to talk
to others uh they argue too much uh
conflict escalates the problem so
they're more likely to get a divorc
having a child before marriage or
getting pregnant before marriage or
getting pregnant within the first year
of your marriage enhances the likelihood
that you will get a divorce the
pressures of a child alone are enough to
almost push people over so those are
some of the things that are actually uh
against you that doesn't mean that
you're going to get a divorce so we want
to talk about in in our text uh the risk
factors that aren't mentioned there that
are not talked about out in the public
world you will not hear any of these
probably mentioned that are a high risk
factor for you but all of these are
amenable you can fix this every one of
these seven you can change and you can
change it today but will you if you're
having problems so that's what we want
to deal with but it's not just about
divorce because this is not about
divorce what I'm talking about today is
about family issues I'm talking about
you risk your family your mother your
relationship with your mother your
father your brother your sister you Rel
all of it over these seven things okay
and it is a serious risk factor if you
you're not getting along with people in
your family you need to pay attention to
this and I don't care who you're not
getting along with in your family pay
attention to this lesson we're going to
look at seven of those we may risk our
family through a lack of
responsibility in this text in Matthew
18:23 it says therefore the Kingdom of
Heaven is like a certain King who wanted
to settle accounts with his servants and
when he had begun to settle accounts one
was brought to him who owed him 10,000
talents and we'll get to that about how
much that's worth today verse 25 but as
he was not able to pay now I don't know
if that means he's not even able to make
a payment or he just can't pay the whole
thing off it doesn't really I think it
means he couldn't pay the whole amount
which makes sense in just a moment his
master commanded that he be sold with
his wife and children and all they had
and the payment be made that means I'm
selling them all that didn't mean
they're going to stay together folks
that means he's probably sell them off
to the best deal he could get and if you
don't believe that later in this story
you'll see that he gets sent One
Direction they get sent another but
let's just stay right here for a moment
in 1 Chronicles 29:4 it talks about
3,000 talents of gold and 7,000 talents
of refined silver that's basically
10,000 that David contributed to the
temple and it's estimated that that was
worth $20 million on today's market so
if if you're in debt by yourself at $20
million let me tell you something you're
risking every relationship in your life
if you don't think debt will mess up
your life you have not realized what's
going on it is irresponsible to blow $2
million but folks it's irresponsible to
blow money period And there's a limit to
how much irresponsibility can be
forgiven by your
family irresponsibility
always makes you think you must be
forgiven by your family that isn't the
way your family feels not a person in
your family is thrilled if you're
rolling up debt upon debt upon debt
they're not so if you want your family
to succeed and survive be responsible
with your money be responsible with your
family needs we
must understand that our family is at
Rich Risk by our not being responsible
doesn't mean you can't have Dad I didn't
say that but irresponsible Dad yeah
you're destroying your foundation right
there number
two we must risk our family through a
lack of honesty we may just risk our
family through a lack of honesty it says
in verse 26 the servant therefore fell
down before him saying Master have
patience with me and I will pay you all
he's
lying he's lying if nothing else he's
lying to himself he is not going to be
able to pay off could you pay off $20
million right now how many you got that
on you right now 20 million okay he's
lying to himself in 1st Samuel 15: 32
and 33 it says this then Samuel said
bring aad King of the amalekites here to
me so AAG came to him cautiously and AAG
said surely the bitterness of death is
passed it' been a little while it's
going to be okay they're all calming
down he's lying to
himself he's lying to himself but Samuel
said as your sword has made women
childless so shall your mother be
childless among women and Samuel hacked
AAG to Pieces right there in front of
everybody and that was just like Days
Later surely you calm folks let me tell
you something you do enough wrong in
your family they don't ever
forget they'll hack at you forever so
don't be dishonest about it dishonest
folks often makes some small efforts but
they drag their
feet they hope that you will eventually
give up or write it off or forgive it or
or or forget it be honest with yourself
in your family be honest with your
family don't say I'm going to fix all
this when you know you can't tell them
amen tell them be honest about your
money matters be honest about your
responsibility be honest about your
duties we may risk our families through
a lack of honesty your mom and daddy
don't want you lying to them your
brother and sister don't want you lying
to them your wife your husband don't
want you lieing to don't lie about money
especially don't lie about your money
stop lying about your
money quit trying to act like you got
more than you
got number three we may risk our family
through a lack of
modesty it says in verses 27 and 28 then
the master of that servant was moved
with
compassion and released him and forgave
him the debt look at what happens verse
vers 28 but that servant went out and
found one he found one didn't find two
he found one of his fellow servants who
owed
him you know immodest people or we might
say even arrogant people immodest people
have a higher view of
themsel than they do of anybody that's
over them are you listening if you got
authority over them they think you're
less than them have you noticed that
that's immodesty in other words Luke
19:21 says I feared you because you were
an auster man see this this one Talent
man thought he was a better man than the
man who had all of
this I feared you because you're an AER
man see I know you're a mean guy you
collect what you did not deposit and
reap what you did not seow yeah see that
one Talent man that did nothing thought
he is smarter than everybody else he's
not
modest listen to me quit being so full
of
yourself everybody that's over you isn't
a less worker or less honest or dumber
than you are quit talking like they
are you don't think that works in your
family quit talking to the members of
your family like you're the smartest
thing in the
room quit being so full of yourself be
modest stop thinking you're God's gift
to your
family and modest folks seem to be
unaware that being forgiven is not a
debt owed to
them nobody owes you to forgive
you if you've done wrong you you owe
them a debt they don't owe you a
debt that's the concept of sin you
sinned you owe them a debt they don't
owe you forgiveness forgiveness is a
gift that they give
you and so immodest people act
entitled that they have an innate right
to be forgiven how dare you as a
Christian not forgive
me wait who did the wrong
here so we may risk our family through a
lack of just being
modest I can't pay it
off admitting it I'm not
there I'm not the person I thought I
was number
next we may risk our family through a
lack of generosity let's read the text
again look at verse 28 but that servant
went out and found one of his fellow
servants who owed him a 100 daera we'll
look at what how much that was in just a
moment and he laid hands on him and took
him by the throat well that's mean
saying pay me what you owe wow that's
that's really tough uh Matthew 16: 26
says what will a man give in exchange
for his
soul would you dare treat somebody
who was doing the same thing you
did worse than you were
treated can you not be a little more
generous would a man trade his wife or
his children would a woman trade her
husband or her children or their
soul would they trade their
Church to make more
money
$20 that's about what this was about
about about 20
bucks 20
bucks he could have been generous and
letting if you can't forgive a debt of
20 bucks you need to borrow some
money okay you need to borrow I need to
loan you $20 if you if you can't forgive
a $20
debt you can't let somebody El off the
hook for $20 and be ni that's what this
was he owed 20 million this guy owes him
$20 where's the generosity here he could
have been generous and canel the
debt how much is
enough does the goalpost in your
relationship keep
changing so if they well now it's 40 or
what does it keep changing so be
generous
outgive everybody in your family what do
you mean by that I mean you need to be
the guy or the girl that does more that
gives more to all the people in your
family we're the Christian
right are you the best Giver in your
family if not correct it
generosity greases the wheels of
life we may risk our family through a
lack of generosity number
next we may risk our family through a
lack of
empathy just feeling what they feel
Matthew 18: 29 he says for his fellow
servant fell down at his feet and begged
him now this is what he had done he
begged him saying have patience with me
and I will pay you all now folks I bet
everybody in this room could pay off a
$20
debt even you
kids that don't do
nothing and pay off a $20
debt you could pay off 20 bucks give me
a little bit right give me a few weeks I
do it I pay off a $20 debt
right
empathy in Matthew 23 and: says they
bind heavy burdens hard to bear and lay
them on men's shoulders but they
themselves will not move them with one
of their fingers do you know that there
are people who have no empathy for other
people and some of them are in your
families are you married to someone who
thinks of himself first last and
always are you the king of your life
that everything hovers around you
and we must all count out to you is that
what your family
faces is it a case that everybody needs
to understand you but you don't
understand
anybody you don't make an effort to see
it from their eyes that's what a lack of
empathy is this this is apathetically a
a person who is detached cold
insensitive unfeeling
he doesn't see himself in the eyes of
his fellow
servant nor can he wait to be paid
back here's the lesson here though be
empathetic see it through their eyes
when you're talking to your brother at
church or your sister talking to your
family your grandpa your grandma your
mama your daddy your brother your
sister see what they see take a long
look in the mirror and see what they see
and then look around them what's going
on in their family be
empathetic they may be having a hard
time and you ain't even noticed you
don't even care you're not aware of what
they're going through you don't know how
hard it is they may be sick and you're
worried about money I don't know what
you're worried but think it through so
we may risk our family through a lack of
empathy number next whatever it is
we may risk our family through a lack of
leniency it says in verse 30 but he
would not so he begging him he's got him
by the throat and he's begging him
forgive me I'll get this to you I'll pay
you back this 20
bucks but he would
not he wouldn't give him that much time
you got and got 20 bucks on you guess
what's happening to you right now and he
threw him into prison till he should pay
the debt now he's probably not going to
be in prison very long cuz he can pay
off that debt in a week or two probably
but still how many of you want to go to
prison for two
weeks who wants
that Revelation 2 and verse 10
Revelation 9 20- 21 Revelation 16 9-11
all basically say there's coming a time
when they did not or would not repent
that's the world we're headed towards
won't repent won't change their heart
which will lead to changing their life
James 2:13 judgment is without Mercy to
the one who has shown no mercy
leniency you may think well that's not
in
families if you cannot change your heart
and ask for
forgiveness if you cannot show Mercy to
one needing forgiveness just saying I'm
sorry don't expect Mercy when it comes
to
you are you
listening if you can't quietly and
nicely be lenient and merciful and
forgiving to various members of your
family who've messed up and you know it
we all know it they messed up if you
can't be lenient to them watch out when
when your turn
comes you will feel something
else it will
happen and what goes around comes
around brace
yourself because it's coming we may risk
our family through a lack of leniency
last
thought we may risk our family through a
lack of pity in this text it's
interesting where it goes here verse 33
should you not also have had
Compassion or or pity on your fellow
servants just as I had pity on you and
his master was
angry you get a feel for where God goes
with
this God God mad at you right now for
the way you've treated your
family that's scary isn't it and his
master was angry delivered him to the
torturers
whoa until well there is a time it will
end he should pay all that was due him I
guess when the guy
dies it would definitely be over in 2
Samuel 12: 5-7 it says so David's anger
was greatly aroused against the man you
know that stole that
lamb and he said to Nathan Nathan's the
prophet who's telling him this story
this
Parable and Nathan said said to him as
the Lord
lives the man who's done this shall
surely die that's what David says to
Nathan and he shall Restore fourfold for
the lamb because he did this thing and
because he had no
pity then Nathan said to David you're
the
man you are the
man you're the guy that didn't have pity
that time didn't feel sorry for your kid
when he messed up your son went out got
drunk didn't feel sorry for him you
daughter messed up maybe she came home
pregnant you couldn't feel sorry for you
couldn't feel for them your your wife
messed up your husband messed up your
your grandfather messed up your
brother-in-law messed up and you
couldn't have pity for that you couldn't
see it Without Pity what Without Pity is
that me is that us is that a threat
hanging over every man who destroys his
family because he shows no pity to
anybody in his family you see the fellow
servants see it you see you won't but we
at church will see how you talk to your
husband or your wife you think we don't
see it we see how you talk to your
brother your sister your kids you think
we don't notice it oh yeah you don't
think we notice it oh we see it and
you've seen it before haven't you amen
yeah amen walls yeah you've seen it
you've seen it and been embarrassed at
church before because the way the one
was treated at the church building yeah
so you live in a bubble and you think
nobody
sees that's not the way it is and then
we go tell the Lord about
it yeah
we may risk our family through a lack of
pity being a person of pity a person of
compassion who do we need to show pity
and compassion to our
kids our
mates our
brother our sister our mother our father
our grandkids our great grandkids our
families need compassion
cuz you need to save them so this is the
lesson today I mean that's basically it
but I want to go somewhere now let me
back up here let me go somewhere if I
can go
back
here just simply risking
everything over really a bad attitude
isn't it all I've talked about today is
really just bad attitudes in
it such as the state of a family not
aware of Grace that's been shown to them
in Christ Jesus that's really the
message of the parable
right if we truly believe it is Grace we
should be far more gracious to all
especially the people that supposedly
mean so much to
us all these qualities are the qualities
of a forgiving Christian trying to do
the right thing by others so the person
others can live with and then they can
forgive you when you mess up because you
are going
to you can be all about
you are you hearing me now because it's
going to apply to me I don't like it but
it's true you can be all about you if
you're a
preacher listen to me Elders you can be
all about you even if you're an
elder listen to me deacons you can be
all about you and be a deacon in the
church Listen to Me song leaders you can
be all about you and be a song leader in
the church listen to me prayer leaders
you can be all about you and Lead
prayers in the church listen to me Bible
class teachers you can be all about you
and be a Bible class teacher and think
you're spiritual and promote that idea
and everybody in church think you're
spiritual and you're destroying your
home how can that happen well it's a
story I love I've told this probably
before here but I love this story and
apparently it's a true story I think so
there's this preacher that they had a
member in their Church who was really
immoral and doing some bad things and so
he convinced the Elders of the church to
withdraw Fellowship from them and so
they did but he noticed that the that
person that with threw Fellowship from
just went over to a church nearby so he
had contact with that church and said we
went through Fellowship from them and
they didn't agree with them and they
wouldn't go along with it so he got his
church his Elders to withdraw Fellowship
from that church and then they made a
big stink about it and he brought it up
at some big conference they had around
and he noticed he got no attention at
all nobody agreed with him so he with
through from everybody in the conference
eventually he with through from the
whole Churches of Christ he didn't want
to have anything to do with them at all
and finally he noticed that his family
thought he was acting a little crazy
about the whole thing so he withdrew
from his
family the only person ride on the
planet cuz he didn't know how to show
any Mercy any kindness and go beyond
didn't know what real spirituality was
you can be all about you and be a listen
to this gentlemen a
CEO you be a CFO you can you can have
all the letters you want about your name
you can be an entrepreneur and everybody
staggered at how much money you're able
to handle around and you can think that
that's financially means that you are
really a Humdinger when it comes to your
family because you have provided for
your family let me remind you that there
was a guy named uh let's see do I have
it up here I think I do or maybe I don't
is it moving there it goes I think his
name was Bernie maid
off $65
billion since the 70s his family was
worth over a billion dollars when this
all came out he had defrauded 40,000
people in 125 countries but boy did he
look financially
sound his two sons finally turned him in
he was convicted of fraud money
laundering and a lot of other crimes he
ended up with a 150 years in a federal
prison of course he didn't live that
long Midol though got really upset not
long after all this blew up because none
of his family members including his wife
and his grandchildren ever visit visited
him why do you think that so he had made
them rich and yet that wasn't enough for
them
wow Bernie Midol died in prison April
the 14th 2021 at the age of 82 made of
sons are both deceased the two that
turned him in Mark the oldest hanged
himself in 2010 at the age of
46 his younger son Andrew got a rare
form of disease and died at 48 they're
all
gone his
wife when they were all this blew up she
had a net worth of a billion she doesn't
have it
now money doesn't get you
there living a life opposite to what
we're called to live whatever that
is and you risk it all you risk your
family you risk everything we are called
to a life of forgiveness which means
responsibility
honesty
modesty
generosity
empathy
leniency and
pity those are the qualities not a large
bank account not a small bank account
none of those things are
it just the qualities that keep a family
together don't risk it all live a life
of forgiveness a life vaguely like a
person named
Jesus repent of your sins confess the
name of Christ be baptized today you
begin that walk maybe but really the
rest of
you remind yourself of what we're really
about
up and don't risk your family if you
need to come come while we stand and
while we sing
