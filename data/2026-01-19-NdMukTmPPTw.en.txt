Jesus is king. Amen. Amen. He's the Lord
of lords. Amen.
He's uh the peacemaker. Amen.
And we're willing to serve him and
follow him. Amen.
And I know some of us will even step out
and say we will die for him. Amen.
But will you go and preach? Oh. Ah,
Keegan,
that's not in my wheelhouse, you And I
actually I have a dentist appointment.
So, uh I don't think I can get out
there.
Are we ashamed of the gospel?
I uh I was looking into um
well, we've been doing evidences with
the youth and uh we
are going into that. So there's there's
five questions that philosophers
normally discuss and that's the origin
where we came from uh the purpose and
meaning of our lives who we are uh is
there a god and where do we get moral
standards from and where are we going
our destination so today I wanted to
talk about our purpose and meaning and I
find it in this topic prepared to
preach.
So I was thinking, you know, when I
stand before God one day, is he going to
look at my qualifications and oh well
done you got so many degrees or you have
achieved this and you've achieved that
in life. Oh, your bank account was so
big. It it doesn't doesn't seem like it
in the Bible.
There's one thing that pops out to me
and I want to go through that today. I
want to I want to guide you through
that.
And what I thought I would do is bring
out a lesson that we could use that
would help us navigate how to talk to
someone. Where this led me is kind of
the opposite of what I started out to
do. And honestly,
it's not a nice lesson. 
So, uh, in saying all that, I did try
and find a joke to lighten the mood. I
couldn't find something that was,
uh, in this topic. It's very serious.
So, on the count of three, you're just
going to laugh and pretend that I said
something funny and we'll break the ice
and we'll get on. One, two, three. There
you go. Beautiful. Oh, everyone's
relaxed now. 
Right. Before I go on, I must tell you I
have an ear infection. So, if I stop and
I'm trying to gather my thoughts again,
I'm a little bit all over the place in
my brain, but I'll try and get through
this. So, I'm going to go tackle these
five scriptures today.
uh Mark 16:15, Matthew, Luke, John, and
Acts. So those that's those are the five
scriptures we'll predominantly be in
today. I want to go to our first
first topic,
the herald's scope.
And he said to them, "Go into all the
world and proclaim the gospel to the
whole creation." That first word there
is go. It's the participle meaning as
you are going.
as you are going.
So it's not a question.
It's uh you know like when I was a
little kid and I didn't want to go to a
youth event. You know my dad didn't say
well would you like to go? He said no as
you are going get in the car right as
you are going. Uh this idea that oh
you're going to the the store. Oh can
you pick me up some milk cuz you're
going anyway. That's the idea. You're
going to work. You're going to gym. go
into all the world. The cosmos, the word
there, the Greek word cosmos. So, it's
quite an interesting word to to look
into. Uh it means the orderly
arrangement.
In other words, we all inhabit this this
like a work world, a family world, a
digital world, whatever it might be.
You're already an insider in these
worlds, in this organized, ordered
world.
Um
the best best way I could could uh
could describe this is it actually
attaches to the last piece whole of
creation thesis I think it is but when
you attach that this idea that scholars
put it together what there's this world
this order and then there's this
creation all of creation this idea of
every creature go proclaim to every
creature in all the world those two kind
of tie in meaning everything and
everywhere Okay,
that's really what it is. Um, and then
that word proclaim
kuruso
means to act as a herald.
So if you know what a herald is, it's a
a herald's job is to strictly deliver
the message of the king.
All right? If he was adding his opinion,
he was failing.
If he simply shouted the king's decree,
he was a success. So, you do not need to
be an aator, a philosopher, or a
debater. You don't need to win an
argument. You simply are a delivery
person. You're a herald. You're the
messenger. You are the mailman.
You know, when you pull up a
a a script and you say, "Here, he here
he he," the king says that he came, he
died, and he rose again.
That's it. You are a herald.
Now, I don't know about you, but that
takes a lot of responsibility off my
shoulders when I feel like I have to
convince someone or, you know, I feel
the weight of the world on my shoulder
because this person's not understanding.
No, no, no, no. You're a messenger.
Deliver the message, the king's message.
It's got nothing to do with me.
It takes a bit of weight off your
shoulders, right? I'm just the
messenger. My mailman doesn't stand at
the mailbox and wait for me to pick the
mail up like, "Did you like the Did you
like the mail? Did you Did you enjoy it?
What'd you get? What'd you get?" No, he
he puts it in. He leaves. I don't even
know what he looks like.
Right. That's his job. That's your job
to proclaim. Kuso.
So, there's there's some good news. It
takes the weight off your shoulders.
Proclaim the gospel. If we don't know
what the gospel is by now, guys, 1
Corinthians chapter 15, the youth know
this, that he lived, he died, he rose
again, and he appeared to to many
people.
Proclaim the gospel. In John 4, I love
this. Uh the woman at the well, she
leaves her water jar and goes into the
city. She doesn't have a theology
degree,
you know, she's not a full-time preacher
or whatever it might be. She simply
says, "Come see a man who told me
everything I ever did." Simple as that.
Come see.
Next point. The Herald's method. Go
therefore and make disciples of all
nations, baptizing them in the name of
the Father and the Son and the Holy
Spirit. Jesus doesn't give us a 400page
textbook on okay this is what how you
need to talk to them or you give them
this textbook they need to study this
and then no no no no
this idea that we are a method we are an
example of of
if you understand that Jesus says love
your neighbor you are qualified
you are now an example to people around
you showing them how to love your
neighbor That's it. Make them a
disciple.
Um
the second word there I wanted to well
actually the first one I want to talk
about baptizing them. Baptiso idea of
immersion.
All right. But also identity and
introducing them into the family. What
do I mean by that? If you look there it
says the father, the son and the holy
spirit.
You know the father's house.
I'm talking to Christians here. You know
the father's house. You have a seat at
the table.
I don't need some authority to bring a
friend to introduce my friends to my
family. I've never had to have that. Hey
mom. Hey dad. This is my friend so and
so.
I've never needed that. The same idea
here is that um baptizing them,
introducing them, ident identifying them
to the family, to the father, the son,
and the holy spirit.
The word there mateo um the disciple
make disciples
means to enroll someone as a student or
to follow a teacher.
Okay. So, it is a relational word.
It is yeah, it isn't about recruiting
members into a club. So, let me be very
careful of what I'm trying to say here.
I know we have this big vision and this
building idea and it's great and I love
it. Don't get me wrong, but I'm not
talking about filling seats for the
building, right? Let's separate those
two things. What I'm talking about here,
making disciples, Mateo, is is what
we're supposed to do for Jesus,
right? If he chooses to bless us with
more people in our congregational
family, praise the Lord. But that's not
my goal here. My goal is to get the
gospel to the people, share with them
how amazing God has been for me. That's
it, right? I want to I want to keep
those two separate. I you know I like
both but if I have to choose Jesus is
first right okay
it's about inviting people to follow the
person you are already following
you're already a disciple yourself you
know what it is like to learn from Jesus
you don't need to be a master you don't
need to be sorry you just need to be a
lead student you are simply asking
someone to walk the path you are already
walking simple
Andrew spends one afternoon with Jesus.
Immediately he finds his brother Simon
Peter and says, "We have we have found
the Messiah." He then brought him to
Jesus. Andrew had zero training.
He had one day experience, right? But
that one day was enough for him to go
and bring the man who later on would
lead the church,
right?
Your readiness is based on the fact that
you already know where Jesus is.
So, what I'm trying to do here is I'm
trying to take the stigma out of
speaking to someone about Christ.
Cuz sometimes we feel like, oh, you
know, uh maybe I'm not good enough.
Maybe I don't know what I'm what how I'm
supposed to do this or uh you know, I'm
waiting for the right time. And Lord, if
if you just show me uh if just show me a
sign, then then then I'll do it cuz I
know we're scared.
What I found with this study is it's
pretty simple and where we at, but let's
carry on. The Herald's authority, Luke
24:47, he told them,
"This is what is written. The Messiah
will suffer and rise from the dead on
the third day. And that repentance
for the forgiveness of sins should be
proclaimed in his name to all nations
beginning from Jerusalem.
Repentance and forgiveness, the idea of
changing your mind or turning around.
Um uh forgiveness is this idea of
releasing or sending away that the debt
is canceled.
You don't need to be a legal expert or a
moral philosopher here.
You are simply telling people, "Turn
around and your debt is canceled."
That's how simple this is.
If you've ever felt the relief of being
forgiven yourself, church, you are
qualified.
You don't need a degree in this. You are
already qualified.
the herald. There's another herald
there. They're proclaiming proclaimed in
his name. Now, this is a little bit
different that I found.
This is there's authority behind this
word kuso.
What I mean by authority,
I have um
sorry, my ears are going again. Let me
uh find my notes.
Yeah, it's it's using the king's
credentials and not your own. See, in
the ancient world, to speak in a name
meant you were a proxy. If a servant
came in the name of a king, the town
treated the servant as they would treat
the king. You don't need to be good
enough, smart enough, or holy enough.
The authority of the message doesn't
rest on your reputation. It rests on his
name. It's not about you.
You are like the mail carrier.
My mailman again.
I don't stand outside and wait for him
to deliver my mail and go, "Whoa, whoa,
whoa. Can I see some credentials? Can I
uh see your degree? Uh, what's your
political persuasion? Um, yeah. It's got
nothing to do with that. You are the
same in the same capacity with the
authority of God."
Then it says there the beginning from
Jerusalem.
Now, he's obviously talking to the
disciples here, but Jerusalem being the
place where they worked, they lived, but
also where they failed, where they
struggled, where they've just failed
Jesus. Remember, they were in hiding.
Right? Where should I start? Right here.
Now, I'm not saying go to Jerusalem and
start there. I'm saying the idea that
it's right here. No matter how nice or
how difficult your situation might be,
this is where you begin. Around the
kitchen table, in a carpool, at the gym,
at work,
anywhere and everywhere you go as you
are going.
Now, I want to say you're in a better
position to do this than I am. I know
I'm standing up here, but my world has
changed. My world, I used to be in this,
you know, I work in the secular world.
So, I had all these opportunities. cuz I
work in the church now. So my world is
all of you, my friends and everything is
is here.
So I don't have the opportunity you have
in work and those situations to talk
about this.
Obviously I'm looking for them, but
they're not as big as what you might
have.
This idea that start right where you
are. You are already prepared. You don't
have to wait for some sort of status.
You don't have to be some sort of
influencer. In fact,
you are already the platform. You are
the the Tik Tok. God is using you to get
the message out. You're not the
influencer. You're the platform, the
empty vessel.
In a way, get out of his way.
Luke 15, the son came to himself. You
all know the story of the prodigal son.
The son came to himself. So his
repentance and then the father ran to
him that forgiveness
you are prepared because you aren't in
uh explaining a complex theological
system you are telling a welcome home
story church that's as simple as this is
welcome home your your father wants you
here he is point to Jesus
the herald's posture Yeah,
I know this can be scary sometimes
talking to someone about Christ because
we don't want to seem or sound like a
crazy person. I have to talk to that
person every day. I got to see them
every day. I want to be cool. All these
all these thoughts in your head.
In fact, yesterday I saw something funny
and this is just going off topic a bit,
but I saw a man at a funeral and I just
finished the funeral and he's got a
hammer in his hand and he walks up in
front of everybody. No joke. And he just
starts hitting the casket, putting dents
in it. And everyone's like, "What?" And
he looks like a crazy person at first,
but when you realize or hear his story,
he wanted to make sure that they weren't
going to just toss the body out and
resell the casket.
And you know what? He's right. When you
look at it that way, you're like, "Oh,
yeah, that's smart." But at the time
when you're watching him smash it with a
hammer, you're like, "What is this guy
doing?"
Meanwhile, he's a loving friend, right?
You might sound or look a little bit
crazy.
That's John the Baptist, locust and
honey in the wilderness. I mean, all the
prophets,
it's okay to look a little bit crazy.
But really, if you look at this, this is
very simple.
And I don't think we have an excuse
here, church. This is where this is
leading. I don't think we have an
excuse.
You don't get to outsource this to
someone else.
Just because Rex and I work for the
church doesn't mean you outsource this
responsibility to us. We all have this
responsibility.
So Jesus said to them again, "Peace be
with you. As the Father has sent me,
even so I am sending you peace."
Before Jesus gives the command, he gives
them his peace.
He knows they are afraid. They're behind
locked doors. He doesn't wait for them
to stop being afraid before he sends
them. He gives them the peace to carry
while they are sent.
You don't need to be fearless to speak
about the gospel. You just need to
possess his peace because you have you
have the Holy Spirit.
You carry an internal atmosphere that
people in a chaotic world are desperate
for. Your preparation is your presence.
The next part there, so I am sending you
u cathos in the same manner. Jesus isn't
just sending you with a message. He is
sending you with a method. How did the
father send Jesus?
He sent him in person, in love, to serve
and to live among people. You don't need
to be a super saint. You just need to be
present.
Jesus reached people by eating with
them, listening to them, and caring for
them. You already know how to be a
friend. You know how to be a neighbor.
You know how to be a co-orker. Since you
know how to be with people, you are
already practicing in this manner in
which Jesus was sent.
Jesus here uses the present tense. This
isn't a historical suggestion. It's a
current reality. The moment you become a
follower of Jesus, your status changed
from lost to representative.
You don't need uh to wait for a calling
or a special feeling. You are already
sent. That idea that
so I am sending you. It's already done.
You are prepared right now at this
moment.
to represent him.
You're all prepared because the king has
already authorized your sentness. Jesus
didn't stand up there and tear the
heavens open and look down and and send
his message. He came down and got in
amongst us.
You are prepared. You You're alive. You
are sent. You have a pulse. You are
sent.
Do you start to see how confronting this
is?
I didn't set out to do this. I set out
just to come up with a nice game plan
that we could use to to talk to people.
But the more I'm going down this road,
the more I'm realizing
we have no excuse.
We are already qualified and making
excuses.
I don't want to stand before God one day
and have to try and use the well you
know I had a dentist appointment and h
and then this happened you know I
couldn't talk to that person and I
couldn't help them
good luck
my final point the herald's fuel
or final scripture should I say
but you will receive power
when the holy spirit has come upon you,
not if, you will receive power when the
Holy Spirit has come upon you and you
will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in
all Judea and Samaria and to the end of
the earth.
You will receive power when the Holy
Spirit comes.
We believe that we're baptized to
receive the gift of the Holy Spirit,
right? So, we have the Holy Spirit,
right? which means we have power.
Doesn't say you will receive a degree or
you you'll receive a better personality
and we need some of that. But you will
receive power.
It's like this. You're a flashlight. You
don't just have a battery in you. You're
plugged into a a power grid that we
don't even know how to explain.
So shine. You have to shine. You have
the power. You have everything.
You have all the equipment installed. Um
there's no future upgrades. You have it
all. There's no future upgrades. Hear
me? That's it. We are ready.
Then I want to take uh our focus to that
last piece, Jerusalem. and in all Judea
and Samaria. We spoke about Jerusalem
already being here, this nice our area,
the comfortable area. Then you move out
to the surrounding area. It's a little
bit further. But then you move out to
Samaria where we don't really like those
people. We don't want to go and talk to
them about the gospel.
We have to
doesn't matter about their political
persuasion. Um it's the mailman thing
again. And the mailman doesn't ask me
what's my political persuasion before he
gives me my mail. He doesn't ask me what
color I am before he gives me the mail.
He doesn't ask me if I'm a criminal
before he gives me the mail.
Same thing with us, church.
And remember, your world is is all those
worlds we talked about, even the digital
world.
I know we we get online and we we have
some some say, and I get it. I get it.
But if it's going to hinder someone
coming to Christ,
is it worth it?
Are you willing to explain that one to
God?
Cuz that's still a world, an ordered
world that we can have influence in.
What's more important? Telling someone
how wrong they are or telling them,
"Hey, this is the way to Jesus."
Be careful.
All nations. The scriptures we read, it
says all nations and every creature,
right? Everyone. I don't get to choose
who. It's for everyone. I don't have to
to win an argument. I don't have to make
amazing opinions or whatever it is. No,
no, no. I just read. The king said,
"Here you go."
I love this. when the religious leaders
interrogated the blind man that Jesus
healed, uh, he didn't debate theology.
He simply just says one thing. He says,
"One thing I do know, I was blind, but
now I see."
When his eyes were opened, he was
prepared to talk about Jesus, even
though he didn't know who Jesus was yet.
Think about that. When his eyes were
open, when your eyes were open, you
should be prepared to talk about Jesus.
If you have an after story, you are
prepared.
All right,
almost finished the structure of great
preaching. So I thought, let me at least
try and get some sort of structure to
help us in our daily lives because now
you know that there is no excuse where
this lesson led me is like
I have a I have a responsibility that I
may not be carrying out. And that's
that's for you to examine yourself.
But maybe we could be better. So I'll go
to the structure of great preaching.
Peter in Acts chapter 2, he starts off
with he connects the current event. Can
I just say the first sermon that we see
by Peter? It starts off with, "Hey,
these guys aren't drunk." I just thought
that was funny. But but what is he
doing? He's actually connecting with
people cuz they're seeing something.
He's connecting with the group and then
he takes it into uh the prophecies of
Joel. Um and then he highlights the
death of Christ.
So he connects with them,
names the name Jesus and calls for that
repentance. There's a challenge.
Stephen, Acts chapter 7 reviews the
history of rejection. And he goes from
Abraham, I think, all the way to
Solomon. And he identifies the current
betrayal, Jesus,
right? And provides a sharp indictment,
the challenge. I'm starting to see a
pattern here.
Paul, Acts 13 recalls the Exodus and
David uh and he talks Yeah. And he talks
about um Yeah. He shows how Jerusalem
condemned Jesus and issues him a solemn
warning. Same thing. establish a a
connection with them. Name the name,
challenge them.
So final slide, I promise
your call to action, church.
So I I broke it up like this. Call it
scent. Surrender.
The first thing we need to do is pray.
You have access to power no one else has
access to.
This idea of inviting God in is so
powerful. We don't do it enough.
It's starting to become a conversation
um with the elders and I and we don't
invite God enough. Now, I know he's with
us, but for us to get on our knees and
Lord, please, we invite you in. I want
to get out of your way. And you know
what's so powerful about this prayer? I
don't know a CEO who lives, breathes,
and eats his product and loves his
product and loves his business that if I
went to him and said, "Hey, I can, you
know, help you with some of your
business that he would say no to me."
I'm praying to God saying, "Hey,
you're all about loving people. You're
all about saving people. I have this
opportunity with this person. Can you
help me?" I pretty much guarantee that
that God's going to be there. This is a
powerful prayer.
And even that if that person doesn't
respond, it doesn't mean God didn't show
up, right? This is a very powerful
prayer. Second thing we need to do is
establish
some sort of connection with someone.
Oh, you're stressed. Yeah, I've been
stressed as well. Blah blah blah blah
blah blah. You know what really brought
me peace? When I found Jesus.
Name the name. Establish a connection
with him. Name the name. And then that
last point, target of choice. I don't
know how else to put that, but this is
challenge. Do you want to know more
about Christ?
It's that simple. Church, you are
already qualified. There are no excuses.
You are sent. John 4:36.
I'll end with this because I love this.
John 4:36,
Jesus says, uh, that both he who sws and
he who reaps may rejoice together.
Sometimes you're going to sew and you're
not going to see the outcome. It's okay.
Someone else will have the outcome.
Someone will reap, but they didn't sew.
Rejoice.
And I promise you, God is on one on on
on both sides, actually. I mean, be very
careful there. But when you feel like
you've lost someone that you swed, I've
seen God step in and do things down the
line that has reaped that harvest. We
might not get to see that,
but you can rejoice together one day
when we're with God,
church. Uh
that was a hard lesson for me when I
realized where this was going, but uh we
have no excuse. Pray with me.
Our dearest God, Father, um we invite
you in, Father. We uh
we're just uh embarrassed about how we
can sometimes be shameful of the gospel,
Father. But we know now that we have
authority from you. We have the power.
We have the Holy Spirit. You have given
us everything, Father. But not only
that, you've already sent us. And uh
Father, we make so many so many excuses.
We just pray for forgiveness there. that
help us to realize that we're in a
spiritual battle and that the war
doesn't stop. We don't get to take
breaks. We're continually there, Father.
And just uh Father, we pray that we will
have hearts and minds to to win souls
for you. And ultimately, nothing else
matters, Father. We know you love, we
know you save, and we know you love to
save. Father, help us to to have the
same mindset. Father, we just um thank
you so much for Jesus who's made
everything possible. In Jesus name we
pray. Amen.
