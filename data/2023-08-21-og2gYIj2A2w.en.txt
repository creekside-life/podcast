I want to talk to you tonight about
something that I hope will be helpful I
believe it can be helpful I think there
are parts of our psyche that we tend to
not talk about we're afraid to discuss
some things and U I'm going to talk
about them in ways that you may not
appreciate may not like but I think it's
important and uh quite honestly from
this it's clear that it is possible to
be driven mad or crazy or whatever ever
the word is but you know sometimes crazy
is a
compliment sometimes being called crazy
is a
compliment Matthew West John Mark Hall
and Seth Mosley wrote these words and
it's kind of popular right now who
builds a boat with no clouds in sight
who walks up to a giant and picks a
fight who turns Lion's Den into a
petting zoo who can have church in a
fiery furnace well I'll tell you who
crazy people trust in Jesus following
him wherever he leads us Kingdom Seekers
walking by faith Believers here's the
church here's the steeple Here's To All
God's crazy people who brings a Bible
into a public school kind of hits on the
lesson today who brings a Bible into by
the way I used to do that
that's who brings a Bible into a public
school who shares a gospel even when the
world causes calls them a fool and who's
not afraid to go against the flow will
count cancel me and call me one of those
because I'm one of those crazy people
trust in Jesus following him wherever he
leads us King Kingdom Seekers walk by
faith Believers here here's the church
here's the steeple here's to all of
God's crazy people I'm one of those
crazy people I'm one of those crazy
people who sees the world as a mission
field crazy who talks to Jesus like he's
real crazy who believes the words and R
crazy who says he's coming back again
crazy crazy people trust in Jesus follow
him wherever he leads us Kingdom Seekers
walk my faith Believers here's the
Church here's the steeple here's to all
of God's crazy people crazy people I'm
one of those crazy people are you one of
those crazy
people now Jesus was described as
crazy it's not something that we talk
about very much but John 10 verse 20 it
says he has a
demon and is mad that's what they
thought of him Michael Card taking off
of that years ago wrote a song called
God's Own fool in his album called
scandalon and he said seems I've
imagined him all of my life as the
wisest of all of
mankind but if God's holy Wisdom is
foolish to men he must have seemed out
of his
mind so I want to defend my title
because I know that there are sometimes
word Warriors
then and I want to defend the title of
calling it paths to overcoming crazy and
I want to talk about that for just a
moment because uh does this work there
we
go
um I
personally uh not sure possession may
very well be real even to this day I
don't know but Mark 5 and verse 9 says
my name is is Legion and notice this
term for we are
many notice he insisted on a plural
personal
pronoun that may be a
psychologically bad
sign using words to insult is wrong
Matthew 522 whoever says you fool shall
be in danger of Hellfire so we're not
not to insult people uh using fool as a
insult is
sin but fool is not a sinful word to use
it's used 75 plus times in the
scriptures depending on your version and
the word means to act unwisely or
imprudently or to be even a silly person
Proverbs 12:15 says the way of a fool is
right in his own eyes when you find
someone who only thinks what he thinks
is right and everybody else is wrong
he's behaving like a
fool that's just a
truth stupid you're not supposed to use
that word apparently but it's in my
Bible it's in my Bible so excuse me if
I'm going to use it having or showing a
great lack of intelligence or common
sense Proverbs 12 and verse one says he
who hates correction is
stupid I'm not going to call the Bible
wrong but if you want to you go right
ahead
insane is a state of mind which prevents
normal perceptions behaviors or social
interactions and serious seriously
mental ill
situations Hosea 9:7 when he's talking
about a false prophet and false
spiritual men he uses these terms
the prophet is a
fool the spiritual man is
insane because the greatness of your
iniquity all that is
true but we don't like that now and
we've become word Warriors don't say
you're driving me crazy well Deuteronomy
28: 34 was just read to you you shall be
driven mad because the sight
which your eyes see yes you can see
something so horrendous that you cannot
recover emotionally and mentally from it
that can happen and many of our military
men have seen such things others have as
well crazy this is the definition
mentally deranged especially a
manifested in a wild or aggressive or
it's manifested in a wild or aggressive
way now that personally describes me
perfectly in the state that I was in and
you've heard me some of you heard me
reference to the fact that I was crazy
not that I am crazy but that I was crazy
and I fully confess it before you and I
have no other word that describes it as
well as that word at those times
somebody says Rex you need to be
sensitive one in five people in the
United States have had or are having
some form of mental illness I simply say
to that okay so you don't like the word
crazy what about the word mental illness
is that acceptable is that not offensive
to describe someone as mentally ill when
is it going to be acceptable to speak
about the subject how do you speak about
the subject we have to have some words
to Define some things and if you don't
have some words to Define some things
you can't have a conversation you can't
even discuss a concept so crazy works by
the way for many situations for example
maybe you'll like this I just invented a
new telepathic controlled air
freshener that's right I just invented a
new telepathic controlled air freser it
might sound crazy but it makes sense
when you think about it
later you'll get it
later and I've also had a series of
panic attacks don't recommend them I
want tell you some of the worst things
I've experienced besides being crazy but
I'm not offended if you use the word
panic or panic
attack uh Don't Panic if we have a we
have the situation handled I'm fine with
using the word it's a fine word
I've been the one in
five crazy doesn't bother me because
I've been crazy and when I'm when I was
crazy let me tell you something the last
thing on my mind that would have
bothered me is what you think about the
way I
felt okay and I wouldn't have cared what
you said wouldn't have touched me CU I
had my own demons that I was dealing
with so thus my title
who is it
offending I was crazy didn't offend me
wouldn't offend
me I want you to think about are you a
truth Seeker or a word
Warrior at some point you need to become
a truth seeker and not just a word
Warrior that feels like you got to
correct everybody's verbiage to get it
just exactly the way it makes you feel
comfortable at some point you got to
accept the truth so now
some actions may make others think that
you've been driven crazy like church uh
here's some
possessiveness that uh possessive driven
acts may be thought crazy for example 1
Samuel
16-8 Saul was thought to be
crazy and thought to be possessed
it says an evil spirit came on
him pretended driven acts may make you
thought to be crazy David for example in
1 Samuel 211
13-15 pretended to be mad slobbered and
acted and rant and
raved Pride driven acts may be thought
to be crazy Daniel chapter 4 makes it
very clear that the reason
Daniel Daniel uh excuse me
Nebuchadnezzar had a developed what's
called a weir symptom and weirdness is a
real thing if you you you pronounced it
differently but it's not where it's Weir
there are Weir wolves and weird dogs and
we're bunny rabbits and we're birds and
we're cats
that's when a person develops a
psychological abnormality where he
thinks he is that
thing and that's what happened
apparently to Nebuchadnezzar it's very
clear you read the story it's a
literally a medical definition of what
happened pharmaceutical driven acts may
be thought to be crazy Bel chazzer in
Daniel chapter 5 is literally drunk he
would have acted probably better in
Daniel chapter 5 had he not been so
drunk
prodigal driven acts may be thought to
be crazy the younger son in Luke chap 15
it seems that it what he was doing was a
little out of his mind because the Bible
says when he came to himself he decided
to go home so his thinking was not
correct possession driven acts may be
thought to be crazy such as Legion
that's talked about in Mark chapter 5
whatever you think of that and then
passion driven acts can be thought to be
crazy John the baptizer in Jesus and
I've given you scripture for that I
won't go into all of that but simply put
that other people on the outside looking
at you might Define you as a little
crazy and that may be true for us all at
certain times but rarely is it really
true and you need to be very careful
about labeling someone
else okay because you shouldn't call a
man a fool don't go throwing around
terms about someone else unless you are
certain of the problems okay I want to
deal with this in kind of an interesting
way tonight I hope it's an interesting
way I'm I'm going to be very open going
to tell you some stuff you may not know
about me and I'm going to tell you in a
such a way that maybe it would be able
to help other people okay because you're
going to run into people who are having
emotional psychological problems and I
think some of this will help and I think
it might help some of you because
there's likely if it's one in five
there's likely somebody in here
pretending to be fine and
ain't
okay okay so we're going to use Nehemiah
just kind of as a jump off point because
Nehemiah is trying to rebuild a wall of
Defense around Jerusalem and what I'm
trying to get you to do is build a
stronger defense around your
mind and protect your mind against
possible damage and if you fallen AP
heart to rebuild your mind to make it
stronger okay that's the lesson we'll go
a couple other places before we through
number one crazy can be
overcome by the path of acknowledgement
in Nehemiah chapter 1 in Chapter 2
Nehemiah recognizes what's going on back
in Jerusalem he gets word he hears about
it he prays about it he's sent there he
goes there and the first thing he does
is he views
how bad it
looked one of the most important things
that I could ever get through to you is
acknowledging a problem you
have uh when I went
crazy I had had
10 major attacks on me that year and I
don't have time to go into those there
were anything from threats to to ruined
me financially to destroy the work I was
involved in but most of them weren't
kidding around I was threatened to be
sued by two three different people and
and I don't have time to discuss it I
didn't deserve that I'm just tell you
straight up that I didn't deserve some
of the stuff I'm going to talk about I
deserve completely but that no so I'm
just simply saying it felt like all hell
was breaking loose on me and my
family number two what happened to me is
a taker showed
up y'all know anything about a little
bit of psychology I became a
taker I wasn't about to give in on
anything when I collapsed the taker
showed up from that it was I needed to
be in control I was going to be in
control of everything that I could there
was a thing that happened I'm into the
fourth thing now a thing that happened
I'd call this a spinning cycle where
whether you know it or not can literally
spin out of control psychologically and
go down and down and down and because
you just keep spinning in your head
around the circle you feel sorry for
yourself go down and you just go down
and go down and it gets worse and it
gets worse and it gets worse you've
never been there if you said well I've
been depressed before n this is what I'm
talking about if you've done this you
know what I'm talking about now now you
know something of depression you've
probably never never been there you just
think you've been there it
is
horrendous uh there is a mental pain
attached to it I didn't think your brain
hurt my brain
hurt and I don't think that's possible
but it did there was a pride and a lust
Factor attached to what was going on
within me I was as proud as I could POS
possibly be arrogant is the best way to
describe who I was I mean you didn't
want to be around me I wouldn't have
wanted to be around
me anger and strength the weirdest thing
I was Stronger Than I never been I never
got tired I could go day and night I
didn't need to sleep I went like a that
bunny rabbit just constant nothing
slowed me down I was angry about
everything and everybody don't mess with
me I show you that was the way I
was I didn't sleep I didn't eat I
couldn't stand Christian music don't
play that stuff around me I was
preaching when this was happening I
could not stand to hear anything from
the Bible hardly and yet I'd preach it
and I was still studying
it it hurt me every minute that I heard
it I have told you that you know drugs
and alcohol are often connected to these
things not drugs and alcohol for me the
normal one but mequin we'll talk about
that another time but basically it's a
malaria
drug you have to acknowledge you have a
problem number
two crazy can be overcome by the path of
attempting Nehemiah 2 and verse3 said
after he viewed the wall he started to
get he got everybody together to discuss
rebuilding the wall and they started
rebuilding the wall each one taking
apart the most important thing not just
acknowledging it if you're going to
overcome crazy from personal experience
you have to admit it now listen what I
don't mean acknowledge it within you got
to tell
everybody you got to tell them if you
really want to overcome a real
psychological problem I'm not talking
about these fairy tale stuff I'm talking
about real stuff you want to overcome it
you got to admit it in front of people
you got to tell them you got to tell
them I got a problem tell them all tell
them all I got a problem I ain't hiding
it from anybody I got a problem this is
a serious problem and you got to admit
it so many people in counseling that I
have seen will not admit what the
problem is will not admit it you can't
fix something if you want admit it you
got to believe this second thing so you
got to admit it out loud to people you
got to believe that you can overcome it
you have to believe that you don't have
any choice if you can't overcome it you
might as well put a bullet to your head
that's way it feels that's what it feels
like I'm just telling you I'm sorry
that's the way it
feels you got to believe you can
overcome it you got to commit to doing
whatever it takes to fix it you have to
commit you don't have a choice about it
love has got to be the work of the day
you got to give up this anger stuff and
you got to get back into showing
love fear you have to let fear that
constant when you are this place you
have that fear drive you because you
need to be afraid that you might not
ever come out of this and it's got to
drive you to do whatever it takes to get
out of
it number six you got to confess you
need to confess before everybody listen
here's what you got to confess I've got
a problem and it's my
fault it's not mean's
fault it's not my wife's
fault it's not my
cousin it's my
fault you're not going to fix a
psychological problem until you're
willing to confess that you are not
you're going to take a drug you're going
to excuse yourself you're going to say
this is just the way I
am you got to confess
it I recommend scripture
Stakes I think those things work that
you write scripture on stakes and drive
them in the ground around wherever you
are put scripture on everything put them
underneath your chair put them
underneath your bed keep them in your
room put them on the wall put scriptures
everywhere it's the not the thing I
wanted to see it was the thing I needed
to see and I knew
it praying
properly most people don't pray properly
when it's something like this let me let
me see if I can help you I had to learn
this it's a hard thing to
learn I thought the Lord could make me
want to be
better
no I thought the Lord could change my
heart so I'd want to be better
no I thought the Lord would answer my
request and change
me
no all he'll do is help you once you
make your first step
he won't fix
you you got to take the step then he'll
support you in taking the step you have
to make the decision you have to take
the step that was a hard thing to
learn and then I didn't think I would
ever be healed when I moved here I was
not
well in 1996 when I moved here I was not
well two of our elders here knew it not
the rest of subn two Elders knew it
okay they knew I I still having a
problem and I was so much better but I
was still messed up I was so much better
it it had been a while but I I was a lot
better than I was but I was a long way
from being well it took between 5 and 10
years of being here to get
well so a good portion of the time I was
your preacher I was mess
up you just didn't know it I I could
hide it pretty
good but there's some rough times that
you didn't know about and then
persisting so that's attempting you have
to admit believe commit look you have to
do these things I'm just telling you
straight up if you've got a
psychological problem right now you need
to hear me I actually know what I'm
talking about here I know more about it
than I wish I did
did that change yeah it did number
three crazy can be overcome by the path
of altering in Nehemiah chapter 4 and 5
we see that they are building but
they're not just building they're
defending the wall simultaneously as
they build it they got a sword in one
hand a tril in the other whatever a rock
in the other and they're they're not
just doing that because there's people
who are threatening them on the outside
but they're also dealing with the op
pressors their own people were
oppressing them and I I got to tell you
that's a a real part of those 10 things
it was I was receiving a tax from
Brethren and I won't get into that but
just I'll leave it right
there so here's what's got to happen if
you're going to alter your mind which is
what we're talking about here okay this
is altering your mind and people say
well that's just the way I think I can't
fix it yes you
can yes you
can yes you can so you get depressed oh
I can't help yes you
can okay first
step take
responsibility ain't nobody else's who's
going to fix it blaming God how's that
going to fix it blame your family how's
that going to fix it everybody else's it
fault how's that going to fix anything
I'm responsible I'm responsible for the
way I think I'm responsible for my mind
I'm responsible for that hole I'm
digging and how I'm spiraling into that
hole and blaming other people I'm
responsible I know some of you sitting
there saying yeah but you don't know my
situation yeah but you don't know mine
either so number one is you need to be
respons number two mental patterns you
have to learn that you
cannot change a mental
pattern and you can't pray it
away mental patterns are like
this don't think about a pink elephant
for the next three seconds okay don't
let the word Pink Elephant get in your
head I'm going to count to three don't
let that word enter your
mind I bet none of you thought about a
Pink Elephant that word was totally out
of your mind right see what you can't do
is do a negative with your mind that
doesn't work with your mind I let me
just teach you something about your mind
if you haven't thought this through if
you want to stop a bad way of thinking
you don't do it by saying don't do
that that doesn't fix it you have to
overwhelm it you overwhelm your mind by
thinking about the positive that's how
you don't think about the pink rabbit or
the blue elephant or what you have to
overwhelm it so overwhelm it you have to
decide and control your thinking
patterns number three your environment
one of the things that you need to learn
to do if you're having a mental problem
is change your environment you can put
up signs on your bathroom window mirror
sorry not window bathroom uh mirror
mirror you can put up words here and
there you can change literally rearrange
your bedroom rearrange your house you
say that sounds silly the different
environment is amazing how it helps you
to think straight I I don't know exactly
why that works but it does work number
four you need input you need input from
good people and good books but mainly
you need inut from God and the word of
God and good Brethren you need good
thoughts you need to hear good thoughts
you need good words spoken to you and
over you you need good deeds done to you
I'm I want to tell you straight up I was
I was my family was so good to
me oh my goodness they should have shot
me number eight attitude you have to
control your attitude you can't always
control it but you can control it more
than you think you can
decide and you need to
accept
again I got to do something about this I
don't have a choice now that six-pack
thing up there is a relatively new thing
I didn't use that getting well but it's
a relative new thing I just ran into and
I really like it basically it suggests
this you you list three things on a
piece of paper that why you can't make
it better and why everything's going
wrong write those down now the problem
problem is that we think that's the only
way life can be so over here you go the
absolute opposite extreme of that just
write them down and the reason you do
this is because you haven't even thought
about those things when you get in a rut
you don't even think about the ne the
positive way you could resolve a thing
in fact you don't believe it can be
resolved that's where you get so if you
could just write them down it gives your
brain a moment to said hm that's all you
need you just need that H moment and
it's worth the world to you because you
haven't been thinking that way number
last and that is crazy can be overcome
by the path of avoidance in Nehemiah
chapter 6 uh he had to avoid a lot of
conspiracies they were working against
him all around him and I'm telling you
what there's sometimes you have to avoid
some situations so you need to
acknowledge your problem you need to
attempt to resolve it and and start
doing something you got to alter your
environment alter yourself then there's
some things you need to avoid one of the
things I would recommend that you avoid
is secular counseling I would never go
to a secular counselor when you're
having any kind of problem like this now
I know that goes against some of you who
are educated and learning I have found
most of what they teach about this sort
of thing is does it reflect biblical
Concepts or Christian attitudes so I do
not recommend secular counseling if
you're about about to break in your head
number two group therapy I don't think
group therapy is good for anybody but
especially not when you're having these
kind of problems because I think it
encourages you to actually copy each
other you hear what the other one does
and now you got an idea oh well your
brain goes down that pathway and next
thing you know you're doing what that
guy is doing so I don't recommend that
it's it's like evangelism
doctors if you're going to do this with
medication of course you're going to
have to go to a doctor if you're going
to do it without medication then you
can't go to a doctor I didn't go to a
doctor the reason I didn't go to the
doctor is I was living in South Africa
living in South Africa if that had been
diagnosed in South Africa and I'd come
back here guess what I would have never
gotten medical treatment for it but by
the time I got back I was doing so much
better I decided not to go to the doctor
so you know so don't I maybe you don't
need one number four uh avoid impressed
people last thing you need is to hear
somebody else's negative
Story number five arguing stop arguing
with people who are offering suggestions
you don't like their suggestions just
stay quiet but don't get into an
argument you're already angry
enough avoid drugs I know that there are
people who just think you can't make it
out of any kind of depression without
medication I'm not saying that that
isn't true I think that there are people
that need medication I I I'm not saying
that I'm not saying that at all but I I
just happen to tell you this that the
world's been standing here
6,000 years what did all those people do
before those
medications was there hope for them or
is only Our Generation now has
hope evil music leave it alone Christian
music is a good thing but evil music
leave it alone if it says bad things if
it curses like a sailor you shouldn't be
listening to it I'm sorry just get away
if you're having and now if your mind's
in good shape maybe you get away but if
your mind's where my mind was stay away
from it aggression stay away from
anybody wants to be aggressive towards
you stay away from them don't get around
them people who are arrogant get away
from it you're already arrogant enough
get away from it stay away from it
blaming people you get around family and
all they want to do is blame you blame
blame blame blame blame stay away from
that get away from it whatever you're
going to do stay away from it because
you'll catch it you'll catch it and
you're trying to get out of it okay so
that's a lesson uh you know uh people
can be driven mad can't go crazy but
what do you do if it happens to you what
if you do if it happens to your mate
what if you do what do you do if it's
your child what do you do are you
supposed to help them how do you help
them what should you do I'm just telling
you these things worked for me and I did
get better
uh and so let me suggest this you're
probably fine tonight 90% of you sitting
here you're
fine but you do need to strengthen your
mind and you need to PR protect your
mind and your soul and so these are the
things we've looked at tonight but
beware of thinking uh you may feel
invulnerable if you feel invulnerable
that's when he
comes uh be humble Be watchful protect
your spirit protect your mind protect
your soul take steps I'm telling you the
devil does walk around like a roaring
line seeking someone to devour and he
virtually got me to the point it's a
wonder I'm still
here it can happen to one maybe it could
happen to you I hope it doesn't hope you
never see anything like what I saw
because it's worse than what I've made
out tonight way
worse way
worse I'd rather be dead than face it
again and that's not a
joke um there bad things that can
happen you need to be aware of it and
you need to be
careful uh back in January this year a
12-year-old girl fatally stabbed her
9-year-old brother in toet Oklahoma do y
did you hear this story it's crazy
story uh L April
L explained that
um from what we found it looks like it
was a medication issue not anything else
it's like a manic episode of some kind
that's what it looked
like but there were no medications
involved L said she has no idea why she
did it it's a 12-year-old stabbed her
9-year-old brother it's her brother
she's heartbroken and she feels very
guilty but she still doesn't understand
why she did it she said it was like it
wasn't her and the team of specialist
working with her they believe her after
working with her for the last six months
every day I believe her too because I
know my child and I know that wasn't her
the police body camera you can go on the
internet you can see all this it's
absolutely depressing I don't recommend
it uh I don't know why I did it she said
I'm so sorry I don't know why it
happened she was screaming that the
night she did it right after she did it
she was admitting it she says I don't
know why I did it I did it I don't know
why I did it I did it I don't know why I
did it and he was screaming right before
he died uh one of the doctors Dr Darcy
Sterling a LIC clinical social worker
said we have pieces of this puzzle that
are just
missing and then he went on to say I
have never heard of a situation where a
child just inadvertently does something
like this with zero warning signs the
meds are not going to make somebody
homicidal like this what she was on she
was a ADHD medication but she'd come off
of it but she hadn't been on it that
long
so all like says to me you need to be
humble and you need to be
careful never look down on anybody don't
be unaware Be watchful for the people
around you love them ask them are you
okay you feeling okay that's okay to do
that right you okay you down I love you
I'm here for you tell them all the time
and don't assume you know what's wrong
with somebody oh well there's that
couldn't be a demon well I don't know
that and I've seen some stuff folks
that's got my hair curling I'm just
telling you straight up I don't know
I've seen some stuff now that I won't
say that I'm not saying it is I'm just
not saying it ain't um 500 years ago if
we saw somebody with their hand up here
walking along talking to somebody that
wasn't
there saying that they could travel at
70 M an hour without any fear and could
fly 500 years ago you'd said I think
that's crazy right but that's our life
now so somebody on the outside looking
in might think something we can be wrong
about other people you can think oh it's
that person sick they may not
be that person's deeply depressed they
may not be see that's the problem with
this whole thing they might not
be they might not they may be they may
not be depressed they may not have a a
demon there may be nothing wrong with
them just because you think they look
crazy doesn't mean they
are uh so we have to be sensitive to
others emotional soundness but we also
must watch for others and help them
overcome whatever it is demon sickness
whatever it is we all should want others
to have a sound and Healthy Mind where
you can function
properly we should all want
to have a sound mind I promise you it's
a lot better than the
other and so sound means
whole and
healthy here are the ways it's def find
you can have a healthy mind 2
Corinthians 5:13 if we are of sound mind
it is for you you can have a healthy
disciplined mind God has not given us a
spirit of fear but a power and of love
and of a sound mind you can have healthy
words hold fast the pattern of sound
words you can have healthy Faith be
sound in the faith you can have healthy
teaching speak the things which are
proper for sound Doctrine each of these
times sound just means healthy for the
most part and totally together healthy
speech is sound speech that cannot be
condemned pay attention and be sound in
the way you deal with each other
our protection is found in staying
connected to the Lord and
um so be aware of it uh stay as
connected as you can it's not an
absolute that you could never be hurt
psychologically to the point that you'd
be dysfunctional as I was but it's more
likely that if you stay in the word if
you spend time with Jesus if you pray
and his spirit is within you you should
be sound healthy solid as a whole person
and a whole family if you're not
connected we always want to help you be
connected to Jesus to repent of your
sins confess the name of Christ and be
baptized we'd love to help you in that
process I know this is probably not
something that you even wanted to hear
uh it's not something I even want to
talk about you see how off and I'm
willing to talk about it but if there is
someone that needs to talk I'm available
if you know of a situation that you feel
like maybe I'd be of some help I'll try
I probably am not the person probably be
better if it's somebody else but I'd be
willing to
try it's because it's actually hard and
quite honestly and I I'll tell you the
way it was when I got here I felt like I
was
clawing every day and sliding
backward I clawed my way back to
sanity when I moved here and I was
already
better every day was
hard every day was hard for 5 to 10
years that I was
here praise the Lord that I don't have
that
now but if there is something you feel
like you know or you need let me know
I'll try to
help protect
yourself protect yourself put on the
whole armor of God that you may be able
to stand and then and after having done
all to stand stand if you need the Lord
though we're here to try to help you
find the Lord if you need to come come
while we stand while we
sing
