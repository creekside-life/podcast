Scripture this morning is going to be
taken from the book of Romans chapter 8
and verse 11. Again that is Romans 8
11 reads. But if the spirit of him who
raised Jesus from the dead dwells in
you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the
dead will also give life to your mortal
bodies through his spirit who dwells in
you. You may be seated.
Good morning,
church. I invite you to open your Bibles
to 1 Corinthians 15. That's going to be
the first passage that we examine this
morning. 1 Corinthians 15.
I want to thank Rex for giving me the
opportunity to speak to you this
morning. And as you can see from the
screen, I'd like to speak to you about
why the doctrine of bodily resurrection
matters. I'm speaking about this in a
quarterlong class, but there's more to
say about it.
In fact, this is a subject that I would
argue we can't say enough
about. And so, what I wanted to do this
morning is just share with you three
reasons why this doctrine matters and
why we should be talking about this as
frequently as we can.
Now before we get into the three
reasons, I do want
to just make sure we are all on the same
page about what the word resurrection
means. All of us, unless the Lord
returns
first, all of us are going to die.
And
yet there are some
scriptures that do speak about the fact
that after death, at least those who are
believers in Christ, their immaterial
soul will go to be with the Lord in some
sense. Philippians 1, for example, Paul
makes this clear. There's some passages
in Revelation.
However, New Testament authors say
relatively little about this
stage. This is not their
emphasis. This is not their
focus. Where New Testament authors place
their emphasis and place their focus is
on
resurrection which means the bodily
raising the raising of our bodies from
the grave. The body that death took is
the body that God will raise to redeem
from death.
And it is this bodily resurrection where
New Testament authors place their
emphasis. It is this bodily resurrection
where death is defeated. Let me just put
a few passages on the screen for you
briefly here just to make this point and
then we'll get into three reasons why
this matters. But just so we're all on
the same page about what resurrection
means. Notice what Paul says here in 1
Corinthians 15. We're going to look at
this another portion of this text
together. But let me just put this on
the screen now. If Christ is
proclaimed as raised from the
dead, how can some of you say that there
is no resurrection of the
dead? But if there is no resurrection of
the dead, then not even Christ has been
raised. But in fact, Christ has been
raised, the first fruits of those who
have fallen asleep. but each in his own
order. Christ the first
fruits, then at his coming those who
belong to
Christ. In other words, what Paul is
trying to get the Corinthians to
understand, which we'll say more about
in a few minutes, is that in this bodily
resurrection, Christ is the first fruits
of God's resurrection harvest. He's the
beginning, but he's not the end of the
resurrection hope. He's the first fruits
of it. And notice what Paul says in the
last line on the
screen. Here's the great
victory. Christ has already been
resurrected. But then at his
coming, all those who are in Christ will
be resurrected just as he was. In fact,
it is this that is the defeat of death.
As Paul makes clear just a bit later in
the same context in the same passage
when he says, "So it is with the
resurrection of the dead. What is sown,
that is his metaphor for being buried,
what is sown is
perishable. What is raised is
imperishable. For this perishable body
must put, excuse me, getting choked up
over this here. This perishable body
must put on the imperishable. And this
mortal body must put on
immortality. When the perishable puts on
the imperishable and the mortal puts on
immortality, then shall come to pass the
saying that is written, death is
swallowed up in
victory. In other words, brothers and
sisters, your defeat of death is not
when you die.
When your soul, your immaterial soul
goes to be with the Lord in in whatever
sense that works out or however that is
experienced, death still reigns over
you. Death is not defeated until you are
raised as Christ was. When your body
puts on the imperishable and puts on
immortality, then shall come to pass
death is swallowed up in victory. Or as
Paul says it so succinctly in Romans
8:11, which Luke just read for us a
moment ago, if the spirit of him who
raised Jesus from the dead dwells in
you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the
dead will also give life to your mortal
bodies through his spirit who dwells in
you.
And so what I want us to see, brothers
and sisters, and to be on the same page
about is that when New Testament authors
talk about
resurrection, it always refers its
primary reference is always bodily
resurrection. Nowhere in the New
Testament does any New Testament author
use the word resurrection to describe
your soul going to be with the Lord
after you die. Nowhere is does a New
Testament author use resurrection to
mean that. It doesn't mean that. It
means the raising of your
body. That is the Christian hope. And
what I want to discuss with you this
morning is why this matters.
Why have I chosen for example to teach a
whole quarter on this subject and then
to speak about it again to you here as I
have the opportunity to now speak to the
entire
congregation? Well, I want to look at
three reasons why. There's more than
three, but let's look at three reasons
why the doctrine of resurrection
matters. And here's the first one. If
you're following along on your handout
and filling in the blanks, here's the
first blanks there to fill out. The
first reason I would submit to you why
the doctrine of resurrection matters is
because of theological
accuracy. Theological
accuracy. It matters whether our
theology matches what's in scripture.
And if we are disciples of Christ, it
should be a given that we care whether
our theology matches what's in
scripture. And that's especially true
when we're dealing with the theology of
a subject that New Testament authors
consider of first importance.
When Paul
discovered that there were some
Corinthian
Christians who were denying the bodily
resurrection of
believers, Paul's response is not to
say, "Well, that's okay. There's there's
different views on the Christian hope,
so it's not a huge
deal." That is not at all Paul's
response. Paul's response is to
passionately and
vehemently defend bodily resurrection
and rebuke the Corinthian Christians for
denying this
doctrine. Look at 1 Corinthians 15 with
me and we'll just look at a
portion of this. 1 Corinthians 15 and
let's read first verses 3-5.
For I delivered to you as of first
importance what I also
received. That Christ died for our sins
in accordance with the scriptures. That
he was buried. That he was raised on the
third day in accordance with the
scriptures. And that he appeared to
Cphus then to the 12. Now skip down to
verse 12 with me and let's read verses
12- 20.
Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised
from the
dead, how can some of you say that there
is no resurrection of the dead? But if
there is no resurrection of the dead,
then not even Christ has been raised.
And if Christ has not been raised, then
our preaching is in vain and your faith
is in vain.
We are even found to be misrepresenting
God because we testified about God that
he raised
Christ whom he did not raise if it is
true that the dead are not raised. For
if the dead are not raised, not even
Christ has been raised. And if Christ
has not been raised, your faith is
feudal and you are still in your
sins. Then those also who have fallen
asleep in Christ have perished.
If in Christ we have hope in this life
only, we are of all people most to be
pied. But in fact, Christ has been
raised, the first fruits of those who
have fallen
asleep. Now, we can stop there just for
this point here.
Why does
Paul so
passionately correct the Corinthians who
are denying the bodily resurrection of
believers? Well, it's because of this.
The theology of this subject is of first
importance. This is why Paul rebukes the
Corinthians and so
vehemently corrects them on their
doctrine.
It's because this doctrine of
resurrection is fundamental to the
Christian
faith. It's because the resurrection of
believers is inextricably tied to the
resurrection of Christ
himself. Notice the logic of Paul in
verses 12-1 17 of 1 Corinthians 15.
Notice his logic.
If you deny the resurrection of
believers, you have to deny the
resurrection of Christ because they are
one in the same event. Now, it's in two
stages. Christ is the first fruits, but
it's the same harvest. It's the same
event. In other words, there is no room
in Paul's mind.
Nor will he allow any Christian in
Corenth to believe in a Christian faith
that affirms the bodily resurrection of
Christ but denies the bodily
resurrection of believers. That does not
exist in Paul's mind. And he's
correcting the Corinthians to show them
that doesn't work because the
resurrection of Christ and the
resurrection of believers are
inextricably tied together. And the
theology of resurrection is of first
importance. If you deny the bodily
resurrection of believers, then you have
to deny the resurrection of Christ. And
your whole system of faith then falls
apart. This is important.
And if those in
Corenth who were
wrong about their doctrine of
resurrection, namely denying it for
believers, if their
incorrectness warrants Paul's correction
and
rebuke, the same is true for us. If we
have adopted a view of Christianity that
affirms the bodily resurrection of
Christ but ignores or worse denies the
bodily resurrection of believers. If if
that's what we've adopted, we're under
Paul's rebuke just as the Corinthian
Christians were. We've adopted a false
view of Christianity.
This doctrine matters because
theological accuracy
matters and theological accuracy matters
especially on those subjects that New
Testament authors claim is of first
importance and that are fundamental to
the Christian
faith. In my
opinion, this is reason enough for why
this doctrine matters. This is reason
enough that we should be talking about
it more and looking for it in the New
Testament and seeing how prevalent it is
in the New
Testament. But there are other reasons
why this doctrine matters. Reasons that
relate to our actual disciplehip to
Christ, our daily walk with Christ. And
so the second and third reasons that I
want to submit to you for why this
doctrine matters are, you could argue
more practical reasons. reasons that
that relate again to our daily walk with
Christ in
disciplehip. So my second reason for why
the doctrine of resurrection
matters is because it gives us a
stronger defense against sexual
temptation. The doctrine of resurrection
matters because it gives us a stronger
defense against sexual temptation.
Well, Nathan, how so? How does that give
us a stronger defense against sexual
temptation? Because it helps us to see
our bodies differently. And it helps us
to see the bodies of others differently.
It helps us to see our bodies in light
of their eternal purpose and value. And
for this, we go to 1 Corinthians 6.
Would you turn there with me? Go to 1
Corinthians 6. So you can see this for
yourself in the text.
Now, before we read it, just by way of
prefacing what's going on
here in 1 Corinthians
6, Paul has to address the fact that
there are some Corinthian
Christians who are going to the pagan
temples and sleeping with prostitutes.
and they see no contradiction between
that and their Christian
faith. And I want you to notice how Paul
addresses this with them. He does not
say to them, "Stop doing that so your
souls can go to heaven." That's not how
he approaches it.
Rather, I want you to see that Paul
tries to correct the Corinthians by
getting them to see their bodies in
light of the resurrection and in light
of their eternal purpose that they were
created for. So look at verse look at
chapter 6 with me and let's just read
verses 13 to
20. Food is meant for the stomach and
the stomach for food and God will
destroy both one and the other.
The body is not meant for sexual
immorality, but for the Lord, and the
Lord for the body. And God raised the
Lord and will raise us up by his
power. Do you not know that your bodies
are members of
Christ? Shall I then take the members of
Christ and make them members of a
prostitute? Never.
Or do you not know that he who is joined
to a prostitute becomes one body with
her? For as it is written, the two will
become one
flesh. But he who is joined to the Lord
becomes one spirit with him. Flee from
sexual immorality. Every other sin a
person commits is outside the body. But
the sexually the sexually immoral person
sins against his own
body. Or do you not know that your body
is a temple of the Holy Spirit within
you, whom you have from
God? You are not your own, for you were
bought with a price. So glorify God in
your body.
Let's just work through this text and
let's make sure that we're grasping the
theology of the body that Paul presents
to the Corinthian
Christians. In verse 13, your Bible
might actually have quotes possibly
around the phrase food is for the
stomach and the stomach is for food.
That is
probably a Corinthian slogan that Paul
is quoting, which is why some
translators now put it in
quotes. And so what Paul is doing or
that slogan presumably would have meant,
hey, food is for the body and the body
is for food. In other words, you've got
appetites, there are ways to fulfill
those appetites, so live, enjoy it. And
you can imagine in that pagan society
what type of lifestyle that slogan would
have engendered. especially when it
comes to
sexuality. But notice what Paul says in
verse
13. Food is for the stomach and the
stomach is for food and God will destroy
both one and the
other. Now, let's note what Paul does
not mean by that. Paul does not mean by
that that God's purpose for your body is
to destroy
it. Obviously, if you keep reading, that
is the opposite point that Paul makes
after that. What he means is those
appetites that you feel now and those
ways in this life to fulfill those
appetites which in this context are
sinful ways all of that is passing away.
That's not eternal. Those appetites
aren't
eternal. And then notice how Paul gives
the opposite view of the body in verse
13. What does he say your body is meant
for in verse 13?
The body is not meant for sexual
immorality. It's meant for the Lord and
the Lord for the
body. Think about h how profound that
is. Your body is meant for the Lord
Jesus the way a bride is meant for her
husband. as Paul's subsequent reference
to to marriage in this same passage
makes
clear. And if your body is meant for the
Lord, if that's what it was created for,
and if the Lord is meant for your body,
think about how valuable your body is,
or I should say, how invaluable your
body
is. But that's not all. Notice verse 14.
Your body is so valuable to God that
look what Paul says in verse 14. Your
body is meant for the Lord Jesus and God
raised the Lord Jesus and will raise us
up also by his
power. In other words, death is not the
end of what God made your body for. He
made it for the Lord
Jesus. Well, Nathan, doesn't death
interrupt that? It does not because
God's going to raise your body to
fulfill its purpose just as he did the
body of the Lord
Jesus. That's how much your body means
to
God. And Paul takes it
further. Notice the union with Christ in
our bodies that Paul expresses in verse
15. Do you not know that you are members
of Christ? that is members of his
body. That's how unified Paul wants the
Corinthians or or that's how much Paul
wants them to understand how unified
they are to Christ. You have been joined
to Christ so intimately that you are
members of his body. That's how you need
to think of
yourself. In fact, he takes it further
in verse 17 when he says you're so
unified to the Lord that you're one
spirit with him.
Now that does not mean Paul is not
saying that Christ is an immaterial
spirit. He makes that clear in later in
the letter. What he means is if you are
in Christ, if you have been unified to
Christ in faith and baptism, you already
have one foot so to speak in the realm
of the spirit where Christ is sharing in
his
spirit. And that same idea is then
presented in verse 19 just from a
different angle. Notice what Paul says
in verse
19. Or do you not know that your body is
a temple of the Holy Spirit whom you
have from
God? Our bodies are meant to be dwelling
places of the Holy Spirit. That's how
unified we are meant to be with the one
who created
us. And so we can summarize all this
theology like this.
Our bodies were bought for the eternal
union with Christ in
resurrection. That's one way to
summarize this theology of the body that
Paul is presenting to the Corinthian
Christians. He is trying to get them to
see to see their bodies in light of
their eternal purpose and value and in
light of the fact that they will be
resurrected with the Lord Jesus to be
with him because you were already
members of his body. And if his body was
raised, so will you be. So how can you
take your body and then join it to a
prostitute? You're making Christ's body
then attached to a prostitute. Should
you do that? Never. That's unthinkable.
It's
sacrilege. Glorify God in your body
because of what it was made for. The
eternal purpose it was made
for. Now, if that's what Paul gives the
Corinthians to help them in their sexual
sin, how does this help us to resist
sexual temptation in our disciplehip, in
our
walk? Well, think about it.
If every person's
body is meant for the
Lord, that's what it was made for. If
every person's body is meant to be a
temple of the Holy Spirit, then how can
I devalue someone else's body by
objectifying it and treating it as
something just to slake my own sexual
desire? How can I devalue them? That
body is meant for the
Lord. How can I do
that? And how can I devalue my own
body? If my own body is meant for the
Lord and my own body is meant to be a
dwelling place of the Holy Spirit, a
temple of the Holy Spirit, then how can
I let Satan convince me that Nathan,
what your body really needs to be used
for is just this momentary pleasure?
That's really all your body is good for.
Pursue that, Nathan.
How can I let Satan convince
me of that cheapened view of my body and
the bodies of
others? Our bodies, brothers and
sisters, our bodies are more than
whatever sexual appetite we struggle
with. Our bodies were bought for a
price because they are meant for the
Lord Jesus and will be
raised with the Lord Jesus so they can
be with
him. Don't let Satan devalue your body
by getting you to treat your body as
nothing more than a vessel for momentary
pleasure.
glorify God in your
body because it was meant for him and it
will be resurrected to be with him. And
that eternal union is far better than
the momentary sexual gratification that
Satan wants us to obsess
over. The eternal union with Christ and
the eternal value and purpose of our
bodies is far better than anything Satan
offers to us.
Well, and one
more. There's a third reason I want to
speak to you about why the doctrine of
resurrection matters when it comes to
our disciplehip. And it's
this. The doctrine of resurrection
matters because it helps us to
understand and endure suffering for the
gospel. It helps us understand and
endure suffering for the gospel.
Suffering in the
body for the gospel is meaningful
because it is in our bodies that we live
the story of
Christ. And Paul gives us insight here
into this in 2 Corinthians 4 where he is
trying to teach the
Corinthians the spiritual realities of
his own suffering so that they can see
suffering correctly because they were
viewing it
incorrectly. And I want you to notice
how Paul grounds his theology of
suffering in the body and in its sharing
of the resurrection with Christ. So go
to Corinthian 2 Corinthians
4 and we're going to read verses 1-16.
And I want you to notice how this
passage is
bookended. Notice in verse
one, Paul says, "We do not lose
heart." And notice he says that in verse
16. So we're going to read this this
passage that's bookended with this
expression. So we do not lose heart.
Well, why, Paul? Why is it that you
don't lose heart? going through all
those terrible things that you're going
through. Well, Paul's going to tell us
why. Look at 2 Corinthians 4 and start
reading with me in verse
one.
Therefore, having this ministry by the
mercy of God, we do not lose
heart, but we have renounced disgraceful
underhanded ways. We refuse to practice
cunning or to tamper with God's word.
But by the open statement of the truth,
we would commend ourselves to everyone's
conscience in the sight of God. And even
if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to
those who are
perishing. In their case, the God of
this world has blinded the minds of the
unbelievers to keep them from seeing the
light of the gospel of the glory of
Christ who is the image of God. For what
we proclaim is not ourselves, but Jesus
Christ as Lord, with ourselves as your
servants, for Jesus's sake. For God, who
said, "Let light shine out of darkness,"
has shone in our hearts to give the
light of the knowledge of the glory of
God in the face of Jesus Christ.
But we have this treasure in jars of
clay to show that the surpassing power
belongs to God and not to us. We are
afflicted in every way but not crushed.
Perplexed but not driven to despair.
Persecuted but not
forsaken. Struck down but not destroyed.
always carrying in the body the death of
Jesus so that the life of Jesus may also
be manifested in our
bodies. For we who live are always being
given over to death for Jesus's sake, so
that the life of Jesus also may be
manifested in our mortal flesh. So death
is at work in us, but life in
you. Since we have the same spirit of
faith according to what has been
written, I believed and so I spoke, we
also
believe and so we also speak, knowing
that he who raised the Lord Jesus will
raise us also with Jesus and bring us
with you into his presence.
For it is all for your sake, so that as
grace extends to more and more people,
it may increase thanksgiving to the
glory of God. So we do not lose
heart. We'll stop there.
In verse
eight, Paul lists all the things that he
and others are currently suffering and
enduring for the gospel, for the kingdom
of
God. How can Paul go through all of
that? How can he live that way? If you
read verse 8, does that sound like a fun
way to live? Doesn't sound like a very
enjoyable way of living life if verse
eight is how you can characterize your
life as a
Christian. Well, how can Paul go through
all that and not lose
heart? It's because of what he says in
verses 10 and 11. Look again with me at
verses 10 and
11. We're always carrying in the body
the death of
Jesus so that the life of Jesus may also
be manifested in our bodies. For we who
live are always being given over to
death for Jesus's sake.
so that the life of Jesus also may be
manifested in our mortal
flesh. In other words, the reason why
Paul cannot lose heart and why he can
endure suffering in the body for the
kingdom of God is because he knows what
that
signals. It signals his union with
Christ. So that Christ's story is being
lived out in his own body.
And what was Christ's story?
Suffering followed by a
resurrection. So if Paul is sharing in
Christ's death in his body, the reason
he can find joy in that is because he
knows what that means. It means he will
share in Christ's resurrection in his
body. His story will become Christ's
story. Christ's story will become his
story.
And Paul makes this more explicit in
verses 13 and
14. Since we have the same spirit of
faith according to what has been
written, I believed and so I spoke, we
also believe and so we also speak,
knowing that he who raised the Lord
Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and
bring us with you into his presence.
our
suffering for the kingdom of God that we
go through in our bodies and whatever
form that suffering for the kingdom of
God takes, our suffering in the body for
God's kingdom is meaningful because our
bodies are
meaningful. And our bodies are
meaningful because they carry in
them the story of Christ, the suffering
that he went through and the
resurrection that he went through. In
other words, we can say it like this. We
share in Christ's bodily
suffering so that we can share in his
bodily resurrection.
And the emphasis there on the words so
that comes right from verses 10 and
11. We carry the death of the Lord Jesus
in our bodies so that we will carry the
life of Jesus also in our mortal bodies.
to connect this with the previous
passage in 1 Corinthians
6. Paul said there that we are members
of Christ's
body. Well, think about this theology
then how this connects. If we are
members of Christ's body and he suffered
in his body, so will we suffer for the
kingdom of God because we are members of
Christ's
body. But his body was
raised. And if we are members of
Christ's body, we will also share in the
resurrection of his
body. The doctrine of the of the
resurrection allows us to understand the
spiritual
reality that suffering for the kingdom
of God signals our union with Christ.
And with that
understanding, we can then endure the
suffering because we know what that
union means. And we can even find joy in
the suffering. Not that the suffering is
enjoyable, but we can find joy knowing
that if we carry the death of Jesus in
our bodies, then it doesn't matter what
this enemy wants to do to my body, I
already know the end of my story. My
body will be raised. There's nothing you
can do to my body
ultimately. My body will be raised just
as the Lord Jesus's body has been
raised. So do what you want, persecutor.
You have no real power over my
body. Well, these are the three reasons
that I'd submit to you. There's more
than these three, but these are the
three I wanted to discuss with you this
morning about why the doctrine of
resurrection
matters and why we should be talking
about this
frequently. Now, these three points are
really applications in
themselves. But let me just close here
by just taking three or four minutes
just to give what I might call three
encouragements to you.
Since the doctrine of bodily
resurrection matters, since it
matters, then make it part of your
presentation of the
gospel. Make it part of your
presentation of the gospel.
After all, if
resurrection is part of what Paul
considered of first importance to the
gospel presentation in the first
century, well, then why would we ever
think to present a gospel message that
doesn't include resurrection in
it? We should be sharing with others
when we talk to them about the
resurrection of Christ. We should be
making sure that we include in that why
the resurrection of Christ matters to
them. It matters because what happened
to him can happen to you if you would
become one with him. His victory over
death can be your
story. That should be part of our
presentation of the gospel.
And then second, since the doctrine of
resurrection
matters, meditate on how it affects
other areas of
life. We've spoken this morning about
how resurrection and the theology of
resurrection impacts how we can resist
and view sexual temptation and
sexuality. We've also seen how it
affects our view of suffering in the
body for the kingdom of God. But that's
not all.
The New Testament has the resurrection
hope just littered throughout. So as you
read the New
Testament, look for
this. Look for what New Testament
authors say about the resurrection of
Christ and our union with his
resurrection and consider how that
affects every other area of life. if
we're correctly seeing life through a
resurrection lens, about what our bodies
mean, about their eternal value, about
how they've been bought for a price by
God, how they will be raised to be one
with Christ, that affects everything we
do in the
body. And so, I would encourage you to
meditate on other areas of life that
this affects. And then finally, I would
say since the doctrine of resurrection
matters, I would encourage us as a
church and individually to thank God for
this hope in our
prayers. God has given
humanity victory over
death and he has invited all of us to
share in that
victory. Thank God for that in your
prayers. Thank God that our
story is not a story that ends with
aging and illness and breaking down and
death. That's not the end of our story
if we're in Christ. If we're in Christ,
the end of our story is glorified bodies
in
resurrection fit for the eternal new
creation kingdom of God.
Thank God for the living hope that we
have through the resurrection of Jesus
Christ our
Lord. Well, that living
hope is only for those who are members
of Christ.
If you are not in
Christ, all that waits before you is
death. That is the end of your
story. Don't let that be the end of your
story.
be unified to Christ in faith and
baptism and receive the gift of the Holy
Spirit, knowing as Paul said in Romans
8, that if the spirit of him who raised
Jesus from the dead dwells in you, then
he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead
will also give life to your mortal
bodies through his spirit who dwells in
you.
If you want that
hope, it can be yours
