good evening
church I hope all is well with
you first of all I want to thank brother
Rex and the elders for allowing me to
speak on this evening I hope this
message will be a blessing to
you brother Rex I I want to Echo
something that was mentioned last week
by Brother
Jeff I don't know how you prepare
lessons week after week month after
month so many
years I'm exhausted at prep at preparing
this one
lesson so take comfort in knowing I
won't be coming for your
job
okay this Le this evening's lesson is
entitled how to manage your money God's
way this is a topic we don't like to
talk about
much I think it's because it can get to
be emotional and challenging at
times but we need to be open about it
because it needs to be talked
about do you know that according to most
interpretations the Bible contains over
2300
versions that mention money wealth or
possessions money is discussed more
frequently than both Heaven and Hell
combined I did not know know
that Jesus often spoke about the
potential dangers of wealth and the
importance of proper
stewardship over
finances showing us how money can be a
major influence on our spiritual
Life
Church we have two choices we can make
when it comes to managing our
money we can do what we
think or we can do what God
says
okay we can do what we think or we can
do what God says I believe God's way is
the best way given our faing at there
Endeavor at
times God has a great financial
plan that works
if we'll just follow the plan
amen managing our money God's way is
about honoring him with the resources he
has entrusted to us I want to share some
biblical principles about managing money
with you on this
evening first principle I want
to discuss is put God first
you saywell how do we do
that well we can begin with tithe and
offering the Bible encourages us to give
a
tenth which is a tithe of our income
back to
God and the Bible reads in Malachi
3:10 bring the whole tithe into the
storehouse so there may be food in my
house and put me to the test now in this
says the Lord of armies
if I do not open for you the windows of
heaven and pour out for you a blessing
until it
overflows church God is asking us to
test him and Trust his
promises Proverbs 3 verse number 9 and
10 the Bible says honor the Lord from
your wealth and from the Fest of all
your produce
then your barns will be filled with
plenty and your Vats will overflow with
new wine essentially God is asking us to
give the first and the best of our
Harvest God wants the best of what we
have church not the
leftovers seek God's
guidance proverbs 35 and 6 says trust in
the Lord with all your heart and lean
not on your own understanding and all
your ways acknowledge Him and He will
make your path
straight
remember always pray for wisdom and
direction in your financial
decisions don't try to do it without
God's help
trust in God's
Provisions Matthew 6:
31-33 reminds us that God knows all
needs and will provide for us if we seek
his kingdom
first let's focus on our spiritual
priorities and trust that God will take
care of our material
needs because God is able
the
second principle I want to
discuss is be
content avoid
greed Hebrews
13:5 tells us to keep your life free
from the love of
money and be content with what you
have for he has said I will never leave
you nor forsake you you know sometimes
um our desire to accumulate more and
more wealth can lead to stress and
dissatisfaction and even
disappointment instead we need to focus
on being content with what we
have church God doesn't have a problem
with us making
money God doesn't have a problem with us
uh having
money but God doesn't have a problem
with allowing money to master
us God has a problem with
that
okay also I want to
share that we need
to the third principle is live below
your
means brother Rex talked about some of
that this morning
live below your
means where unfortunately or
fortunately this particular
principle came to me by
default and what I mean by that
is growing
up we had very
little and I mean very little I grew up
in one of
the poorest counties in the State of
Florida up in Madison
County so we learned how to live below
our means early
on and I was telling someone this
morning I mean to the point
of just remembering even in
1974 still using
in out
house I'm telling you how old I am
too but our means were very small but
you
know the lesson in that
was I learn how to adapt to having
less and I know that it helped me to um
help to form who I am today so for me
living mean living below my means is
something that out of all these
principles probably is the one
that probably has come to me the easiest
out of all of these that I'm going to
discuss so living below our
means budge and save that's one of the
things that we want to do to live below
our means Proverbs 21:20 says there
there is precious treasure and oil in
the home of the wise but a foolish
person swallows it up which means he
wastes
it having a budget helps us plan and
live within our means which can ensure
we have enough for essential needs
savings and general generous
giving I like the part there about the
generous giving because when we do that
living under that budget we're able to
help others more than just for
ourselves but when we're stretched to
the point where we don't have enough but
for us we can't share with anyone
else avoid
debt Romans 138 advises us to let no
debt remain outstanding
accept the continuing debt to love one
another
also remain uh helping us to realize
when I say let the debt uh let no debt
remain outstanding in other words pay
your
bills pay your
bills accept the continuing debt to love
one another in other words also avoid
excessive
debt and focus on living a debt-free
life using credit wisely and only when
necessary what this means is when
someone owes money to another person
being the
lender you're essentially controlled by
the lender until the Deb is
repaid as if you were a slave to the
person you owe the money
you my fourth principle is to be
generous 2 Corinthians chapter 9:7 says
each one must do just as he's decided in
his heart not reluctantly or under
compulsion for God loves a cheerful
Giver Church generosity is an expression
of God's love
and a way to invest in his
kingdom do you want to invest in his
kingdom help those in need Proverbs 19:1
17 tells us whoever is King to the
whoever is kind to the poor lends to the
Lord and He will reward them for what
they have
done Proverbs 22:9 tells us one who is
generous will be blessed because he
gives some of his food to the
poor and I got to thinking about
that and helping those in need and I
said you know instead of waiting for
others to come to
us we ought to look for opportunities to
help others with our
resources whether it's through financial
support volunteering or acts of
kindness trust
me someone is seeking your help
today someone is seeking your help
today principle number
five work hard and be
diligent work as unto the
Lord Colossians 3:22 tells us whatever
you do
work at it with all your heart that's
working for the Lord not for human
Masters in other words we should
approach our work with diligence and
integrity knowing that our work is a
form of worship in a way to provide for
our
families avoid
laziness proverbs 10:4 teaches us that
lazy
hands uh make for poverty but diligent
hands bring
wealth avoiding
laziness brings me back to when I was a
Youngster growing up in Madison County
and spent a lot of time with my um my
grandfather and we would sit around and
I remember what he told me once and it
stuck to me and he
said
son he says in this
life people are going to say things
about
you I was
like
okay he says
uh but one thing I want you to
do whatever they say about you don't let
them call you lazy
and that stuck with me and I've been
working ever
since he says don't be
lazy so let's avoid
laziness because hard work coupled with
wise decisions leads to financial
stability my sixth principle is plan and
be
wise yes we don't know about tomorrow
but let us plan plan for now plan for
tomorrow plan for the
future Proverbs
215 says the plans of the diligently the
diligent certainly lead to Advantage but
everyone who is in a hurry certainly
comes to
Poverty what I'm saying is financial
planning and saving and investing for
the future are important steps in
managing money
well one of those things or not an old
say but one of the things that I've
always used I use it with my players on
the fields and use it in life for myself
and um L use it in my work life and uh
one of the things I like to you
is a lack of preparation causes
frustration
and I found that to be so true because
when we're not
prepared we get frustrated because we're
not prepared and we can't carry out the
tasks that have been given to us or that
we things that we want to do so planning
and preparation is very
important
um also avoid getting getrich U quick
schemes which seems to be a growing
Trend right about
now and I say that
because it appears some people don't
they don't want to
work they want to get rich
quit by any means
necessary insurance
fraud ID their
fraud um
uh you name it all types of Fraud and in
street slang they call it putting in the
work I call it
stealing that's what I call it okay
because when you're taking something
from somebody that doesn't belong to you
that's what you're doing you're stealing
it so Proverbs 1311
advises that
wealth obtained from uh from nothing
dwindles but one who gathers by labor
increases
it in other
words wealth built through honest and
steady efforts is far more sustainable
than trying to get rich quickly
also you know I've heard this I got this
from someone forget where I heard it but
it it sounded good and I thought I would
share it with
you you know it
says some people think the happiest
people in the
world are the ones who have the most
money who make the most
money who spend the most
money but you know what the ones who are
the happiest are the ones who have
learned to manage their money
wisely you know because I believe that
the more that we
have the more trouble we
have at times it seems like money can be
a monster to some people not everyone
because some people can't handle money
whether it's a little or a
lot it makes me wonder I believe if I
wonder if we' be better off sometime
having
less don't know I've been there have had
less it hasn't killed
me but I I haven't had a million
dollarss
either so that's just a
thought okay the um seventh principle I
have here is
trust God's
timing wait on
God that's
essential that's
commended wait on God PSAL 377 reminds
us to rest in the
Lord and wait patiently for
him do not get upset because of one who
is successful in his
way because of the person who carries
out wicked
schemes we should avoid rushing into
financial
decisions or making
impulsive purchases
church when we follow these principles
we honor God in our financial
management align our priorities with his
word and
experience peace in our financial
life I want to share a quote with
you from a Greek philosopher Nam you've
heard of
him called
SES it's about being
content he says he who is not contented
with what he
has would not be
contented with what he would like to
have he who is not contented with what
he has would not be
contented with what he would like to
have
and what this reminds us is that reminds
us that
true contentment comes from
within and is not dependent on external
possessions or
circumstances so church I just want to
say is that again we need to follow
God's principles because God's way is
the best way
you see Jesus didn't die only Jesus
Christ didn't only die on the cross to
save
us but to take over every part of our
Lives including our
finances if we truly believe that God
through Christ Jesus gives us eternal
life then we must
believe he can also give us anything we
need in this life as well
I plan not to take up all your time this
evening but I do thank you for being
attentive to the things that I've
said and I hope this lesson has been a
blessing to you for it truly was a
blessing to me because I got a chance
to delve into some things that help me
to get a better understanding
about the financial picture that I did
not already know
