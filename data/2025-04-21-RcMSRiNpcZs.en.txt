april Fool's Day
2013 Sarah was induced and we had Em and
Isaiah whom so many of you
know it was the greatest delivery
because no one believed Sarah was in
labor and then we started sharing baby
pictures after he was born and everyone
was mad at us because we didn't tell him
to come to the hospital

Lord had once again blessed us with a
son and the month of April will always
be distinct and special to us because of
our April Fool's Day

do you feel a do you feel lost alone or
sinking do you tend to focus on the
storm around you versus the Savior in
front of
you we read in Matthew
14:28:31 the story of Jesus approaching
his disciples at night in the middle of
a storm
the passage reads beginning in verse
28 "And Peter answered him and
said,"Lord if it is you command me to
come to you on the water." So he said
"Come." And when Peter had come down out
of the boat he walked on the water to go
to Jesus
but when he saw that the wind was
boisterous he was afraid and beginning
to sink he cried out saying "Lord save
me." And immediately Jesus stretched out
his hand and caught him and said to him
"Oh you of little faith why did you
doubt?" And when they got into the boat
the wind ceased then those who were in
the boat came and worshiped him saying
"Truly you are the son of
God." I want you to know that I have
been
Peter i have been ambitious and willing
to get out of the boat i have felt like
I have kept my eyes on the Lord
i get distracted lose my focus and sink
crying out to the Lord "Lord save
me." Why do I doubt why do you
doubt faith requires
focus peter was able to walk on the
water as long as he kept his eyes on
Jesus
the moment he became distracted by the
wind and waves fear set in and he began
to
sink this reminds us that maintaining
spiritual focus especially during
storms helps sustain our faith and
confidence fear disrupts
faith doubt crept in when Peter focused
on his circumstances instead of the
Savior
in times of hardship fear can cloud our
perspective but trusting in God's
presence and power keeps us steady amid
chaos jesus responds to our
cry even when Peter doubted and started
to fall Jesus immediately reached out
and saved him this shows that Christ's
grace meets us right where we are
he is ready to lift us up the moment we
call on him no matter how far we've
slipped furthermore I want to talk to
you about the dangers of
doubt in John 20 24-29 we read about
Thomas and his doubting the resurrection
of the Lord
this passage states "Now Thomas called
the
twin one of the twel was not with them
when Jesus
came." The other disciples therefore
said to him "We have seen the Lord."
So he said to them "Unless I see his
hands in the prince of the nails and put
my finger into the prince of the nails
and put my hand into his side I will not
believe." And after eight days his
disciples were again inside and Thomas
with them jesus came the doors being
shut and stood in the midst and said
"Peace to
you." Then he said to Thomas "Reach your
finger here and look at my hands and
reach your hand here and put it into my
side do not be unbelieving but
believing."
And Thomas answered and said to him "My
Lord and my
God." Jesus said to him "Thomas because
you have seen me you have
believed blessed are those who have not
seen and yet have
believed." Like Peter in the storm I
have been
Thomas thomas knew that Jesus had died
he witnessed him being
arrested tried convicted beaten and
crucified the problem Thomas faced was
that he was leaning on his own
understanding thomas did not allow for
the power of God within this
situation doubt can distant us distance
us from fellowship
thomas missed Jesus's initial appearance
because he was not present with the
other
disciples sometimes when we isolate
ourselves in seasons of doubt or
discouragement we miss opportunities for
encouragement staying connected to the
body of Christ strengthens our faith and
positions us to witness God's presence
jesus meets us in our doubt but he calls
us
higher jesus didn't shame Thomas for his
unbelief instead he lovingly invited him
to see and touch the
evidence however Jesus also gently
challenged Thomas do not be unbelieving
but
believing this shows that while God is
patient with our questions he desires to
grow us into deeper unwavering
faith faith without sight is honored by
God jesus declared a blessing over those
who believe without seeing blessed are
those who have not seen and yet have
believed true strength of faith lies in
trusting God's word and promises even
when we cannot see the
outcome this kind of faith builds
spiritual resilience and draws us closer
to God's
heart i have lived my own tremendously
dark days
and to be honest with you sometimes the
shadows still creep in and cast their
doubts five years ago this month April
10th
2020 my best
friend the best man at my
wedding my dear friend who I had
known for 25 years ended his life by
suicide for 25 years I had lived at the
901
gate and then
suddenly
tragedy once again I was standing at the
902
moment i woke up on the morning of
Saturday April 11th
2020 at the 903 gate to the news that
Kenneth Larry Connley was gone
he died at the age of
34 just 16 days before his 35th
birthday yes in the month of
April losing sight of the Savior in
front of me in the midst of the
storm oh you of little faith
doubting my new
reality doubting what was real and
really in front of
me it hurt it
hurts so where are
you what are you dealing
with how willing are you to share your
heartaches and
burdens with those around you here
tonight
are you in your post-t tragedy
moment are you
hurting are you calling out to the
Lord Lord save
me let me tell
you about a
hope that surpasses all understanding
matthew
28:1-10 reads "Now after the
Sabbath as the first day of the week
began to dawn Mary Magdalene and the
other Mary came to see the tomb and
behold there was a great earthquake
for an angel of the Lord descended from
heaven and he came and came and rolled
back the stone from the
door and sat on it his countenance was
like lightning and his clothing was
white as
snow and the guard shook for
fear of him and became like dead men
but the angel answered and said to the
women "Do not be afraid for I know that
you seek Jesus who was
crucified he is not here for he is
risen as he said come see the place
where the Lord
lay and go quickly and tell his
disciples that he is risen from the dead
and indeed he is going before you into
Galilee there you will see
him behold I have told you." So they
went out quickly from the tomb with fear
and great joy and ran to bring his
disciples word and as they went to tell
his disciples behold Jesus met them
saying
"Rejoice." So they came and held him by
the feet and worshiped
him then Jesus said to them "Do not be
afraid go and tell my brethren to go to
Galilee and there they will see me
the grave is empty and death has been
defeated christ conquered death once and
for all jesus's excuse me Jesus's
resurrection proved his authority over
death sin and the
grave no other event in human history
holds the same power or finality
he rose just as he said validating every
promise he
made his victory over death assur
assures us that death no longer has the
final word for those who trust in
him 1 Corinthians
15:55-57 the resurrection secures our
salvation and redemption
through the resurrection Jesus completed
the work of redemption and restored our
broken relationship with the
father the empty tomb confirms that the
penalty for sin has been paid in full
and we are offered eternal life through
faith in
him romans 6 4 and 5 this gift of grace
is a direct result of his triumph
the risen Christ is our living
hope jesus's resurrection gives us more
than historical
faith it offers living hope in the
present and for eternity first Peter
1:3 no matter how hopeless life may feel
the risen Savior reminds us that new
life
restoration and joy are always possible
through him his presence brings us
courage in
fear and purpose in uncertainty
jesus the resurrected Christ is the hope
that surpasses all
understanding and for you to partake in
that hope you must hear the
gospel repent of your
sins confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
and
Savior be baptized for the remission of
your sins and live according to
scripture
i am grateful for the
opportunity to have been here with you
this evening and if there is anything we
can do for you won't you come while we
stand and sing
