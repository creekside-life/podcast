lesson tonight is going to be talking
about unification in what seems to be a
divisive world it's no surprise that
when we look around of the world we feel
that it's pretty much filled with all
sorts of divisiveness uh just to run
through a few topics that kind of you
know play into this in nowadays is
politics race gender marital issues
socioeconomic classes and even church
and religion this breakdown begins with
the self-concept of me and my when we
should be focused on he and
his we are constantly bombarded by media
especially social media telling us that
we should be focused on ourselves in the
uh with the the term of self-care
thinking only about ourselves not about
those around us or what our self-care
might do to those that we come in
contact with it's not to say that we
shouldn't tend to our Mis uh misical our
mental physical or emotional um attribut
of course we need to take care of
ourselves you know we're we're commanded
to do that by God as well but we can't
do that at the expense of other people
we can't do that at the expense of our
brothers and our sisters and we can't do
that at the expense of our
family so what happens is is we see
nowadays A lot of people thinking that
their words are truth and that their
opinions are fact without wanting to
listen to anything else that's given to
them not hearing both sides of the story
but rather rather shutting down the
speech that comes back and the the
discourse between people whether it be
you know again between all those um
mentioned in the list above becomes very
common to see people and I'm sure we've
all done it ourselves spewing things
that we are certain is true that
unfortunately turns out to not be that
way when we do that we're simply giving
back into this divisive culture so th
then I present a question how then could
the all- knowing god put such a daunting
command on his people to unify when it
seems nearly impossible in this world
today this concept is nothing new from
the beginning of time humanity has
wrestled with separation and
individuality on my own the first ever
humans led to the separation of God
because of their own self-
servant so we see a push among many
Christians and my faith is mine and
between me and Jesus alone or I have a
personal walk and a personal
relationship with Jesus only everything
is between me and him I don't need
anything else while avoiding church or
the organized institution of religion
which I remind you is the bride of
Christ in the name of it being corrupt
or there's hypocrisy or it's a place
where you know it's just those those
people uh or even just pure convenience
ah well I could sleep in a little bit
you know I'll wake up and I'll say my
prayers in the morning not to say that
it's not important to say your prayers
or that we shouldn't have a personal
relationship with God God of course
that's what we're asked to do and of
course that's how any relationship works
but at the end of the day this is
something more than just about me so
with that I would like to discuss three
short points on places in our life that
we can work to bring about deeper unity
and which in turn will encourage us and
will better us even more than just
focusing on ourselves ever could the
first point tonight that I want to bring
is unification through our faith
unification through our faith if you
look uh if you have your Bibles open uh
to Ephesians chapter 4 continuing
further down from the verses that were
just read by Neil uh Ephesians 44-6
reads there is one body and one Spirit
just as also you were called in one hope
of your calling one Lord One Faith one
baptism one God and Father of all who is
over all and through all and in
all this here seems pretty clear that
there is not but one Faith there is one
scripture from which we get that faith
and um you know it's it's not something
that's up to our own individual
choosing if you would like to turn to 1
Corinthians 1:10 it reads now I exhort
you Brethren by the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ that you all agree and that
there be no divisions among you but that
you may be but that you be made complete
in the same mind and in the same
judgment so not only is this something
where we are uh called to not have
divions to not have separations between
our number but to be made complete we're
told to have Unity One mind and the same
judgment the same Discerning of these
scriptures that have been given to us by
the apostles and by the disciples and
the writers of this Bible so we're
called to be unified in our faith and in
the same mind and same Judgment of
course does not mean that we all have to
think the same that everybody's going to
have the exact same outcome on every
single point or that there won't be
individual differences in our walks of
Faith but that the roots of our faith
should be nourishing the same tree and
that comes back to of course our
Doctrine or what we believe and what is
our what we like to call Kingdom issues
we should be all sitting here on the
same plane whenever we come to these
issues because if not it's going to lead
to of course division that leads us to
point number two which is unification
through our function we're unified
through our worship what we are doing
right now is a UniFi in act between us
some examples of our of course are
singing our prayers communion I mean if
you take apart the the calm what are you
left with um it's easy to sing and be
focused on how I sound and uh Rex
mentioned on this this morning it's easy
to you know am I sounding okay am I
making a good sound instead of focusing
on what's in our heart what the words in
our heart are singing out to God we all
know the verse Ephesians 5:1 18-19 and
do not get drunk with wine for that is
dissipation but be filled with the
spirit speaking to one another in Psalms
and hymns in spiritual songs singing and
making Melody to the Lord in your heart
again this is speaking to one another
your singing is an encouragement to me
your singing is an encouragement to all
those around you it's an encouragement
to those who are unable to be here and
who are listening at home what we do in
our act of worship is an encouragement
to those who sit around
us further from there we also have that
it's easy to forget that communion is
this one act of us communally
acknowledging the sacrifice that God
made for us and this is something that I
try to do whenever we go through
communion but um it's easy to to forget
this I guess just because of distance
but I try to think of this as a
worldwide act it's very easy to get
caught up in my my time and I'm I'm so
glad that we're passing the trays again
uh because it makes it feel at least to
me a little bit more of that communal
act than just having a single selfs
serve um it makes it feel like that
family dinner of passing the meal and
and that um that really I can't think of
the word but the um personal not
personal the
interconnected um feeling through that
but this this isn't something that stops
here at Bell Sholes or Creekside excuse
me whenever we're uh doing communion
together there are people thousands
millions of people worldwide partaking
in this singular Act of breaking bread
and of drinking from a cup in order to
honor and to recognize and to remember
Christ's death and I just I find that
amazing that that this has been
instituted for so many people for so
long and yet we all do it together and
we all do it at one time time and it's
something that uh that unifies Us in
that if you look at the book of Acts 2
verse 41-42 of course this is uh Peter
speaking um at the at the first at the
right after Jesus had um ascended back
in the the lesson he was giving so then
those who had received his word were
baptized and that day they were added
about 3,000 Souls they were continually
devoting themselves to the apostles
teaching and fellowship and to the
breaking of bread and to prayer
continually doing this uh to the
apostles teaching and this is 3,000
people added I I can imagine what that
day must have been like to see that many
people uh believe after the the teaching
but
um it's it's something where this this
was done together and this was done with
the mindset of of perseverance in it
this isn't a oneandone you know okay we
had our communion for this week we said
our prayers for this week you know I'm
I'm good to go they were continually
devoting themselves to these teachings
uh to the breaking of bread and to
prayer if you look at Matthew 26: 26
again explaining more while they were
eating Jesus took some bread and after
blessing he broke it and gave it to the
disciples and said take eat this is my
body the first part gives it away there
while they were eating this was I mean
I'm I don't know about you guys but I I
can't do anything by myself to be quite
honest but I especially can't really eat
by myself I don't really like to go
somewhere and sit around and eat by
myself I like to be with people and and
eat among people and have conversation
and laugh and talk and it's it's a it's
a community of of friends and people
that I love and that's what's Happening
Here with Jesus and his disciples these
are his his closest you know posy his
group this is the people that he
Associates himself with the most and not
only that but this is at the end of his
ministry so this has been quite a little
bit of time few years that they've been
together so they have a good nice really
strong connection with each other and in
that it is at something so you know
between people so communal eating a
dinner a meal together especially for
them and and in this time this this
culture these meals were were a lot of
times symbolic lasted a long time it it
was a time for them to be together this
is where he institutes the Lord's
Supper finally the last point is
unification through our family this is a
kind of a double-sided coin here because
we should strive for Unity within our
homes as well as we should strive for
Unity within our church in our church
family it's said multiple times Paul
mentions it numerous times that we are
all one body in Christ I have quite a
few verses on this one to read through
and I think a lot of them are pretty
self-explanatory uh back in Acts chapter
4:32
and the congregation of those who
believed were of one heart and one soul
and not one of them claimed that
anything belonging to him was his own
but that all those or all things were
common property to
them again I mean self-explanatory here
one heart one Soul this congregation
viewed themselves as nothing is mine but
everything is ours you know and and how
often do we have that mentality you know
it's it's easy today I I worked hard for
this I put in the hours I did the time I
did the work I bought this with my own
money nope you know you can look can't
touch can't know this is mine it's very
easy to get that I did this for me
mentality instead of what God has
blessed us with and then in turn I can
further bless others uh with the same
thing that God has blessed me with um
it's a tough tough concept but uh
obviously it's one to strive for
continuing um in the scripture Galatians
uh 3 and:
27-28 for all of you who were baptized
into Christ have clothed clothed
yourselves with Christ there is neither
Jew nor Greek there is neither slave nor
free man there is neither male nor
female for you are all one in Jesus
Christ again for all those you who are
baptized The church here is being um
spoken to we're all one in Christ
there's no division that God sees in his
mind when he looks at us as his children
outside of he sees us as his children
one in Christ Ephesians 4:
11-16 and he gave some as Apostles and
some as prophets and some as evangelists
and some as pastors and teachers for the
equipping of the Saints for the work of
service to the building up of the body
of Christ until we all attain to the
unity of the faith and the knowledge of
the Son of God to a mature man we are no
longer to be children oh excuse me to a
mature man to the measure of the stature
which belongs to the fullness of Christ
as a result we are no longer to be
children tossed here and there by waves
and carried about by every wind of
Doctrine by the trickery of men by
craftiness and deceitful scheming but
speaking the truth and love we are to
grow up in all aspects into him who is
the head even Christ from whom the whole
body being fitted and held together by
what every joint supplies according to
the proper working of each individual
part causes the growth of the Body for
the building up of itself in
love so by being united we can overcome
this deceitful Doctrine false teachers
trickery of men I cannot tell you how
many times I'm
scrolling excuse me scrolling through
Instagram Facebook Tik Tok whatever
social media have you noway and you see
these videos of these teachers come up
or these you know preachers as they
would call themselves come up and it
just seems like every single last thing
that comes out of their mouth is the
complete opposite of what the Bible is
honestly saying I mean it it is
astounding how many times these these
come up and it's not only that it's
astounding at how many people you see
sitting out in the crowds and how many
comments you see on these posts and how
many likes you see and how many children
that's come across that have these
social media applications and how many
young adults this has come across and
how many lost adults this has come
across that see these teachings and
believe and buy into them because of the
twisting and the manipulating and the
the using of scripture for own personal
gain whether it be money whether it be
the the fame whether it be the
status it it's a scary thing that how
often we see this and it's very very
difficult to overcome anything like this
this by yourself no battle is won by an
individual but by a band of people Band
of Brothers a band of sisters a band of
Christians we are in a spiritual warfare
that is no doubt about it and it takes
all of us working together as one to
overcome and we can do that because
we're one in Christ and he's our head so
that we can also notice how each
individual ual is giving gifts to build
up the body again it says from the
bottom there him who is head even Christ
from whom the whole body being fitted
held together every joint that supplies
according to the proper working of each
individual part each individual part has
a purpose an arm without a rest of the
body is pretty useless a head without
arms legs and a torso is pretty
useless we can't operate without using
our gifts together for good it's easy to
have a gift and keep it to yourself I
think about the talents uh Parable and
you know he he kind of keeps it to
himself and and nothing really gets much
out of that but the people who sew those
talents out gain more if we sew out our
gift we'll gain more as a group than if
we keep it to
ourselves further from there I want to
read a a verse in John 17:
20-23 says I do not ask on behalf of
these alone but for those also who
believe in in me through their word that
they may all be one even as you father
are in me and I in you that they also
may be in us so that the world may
believe that you sent me the glory which
you have given me I have given to them
that they may be one just as we are one
i in them and you and me that they may
be perfected in unity so that the world
may know that you sent me and love them
even as you have loved me so what I find
really really cool about this verse is
this is Jesus praying to God and if you
look at the verses preceding the ones
that I just read he's specifically
praying for um his disciples and asking
for them to be one and you know as as he
is in God and God is in him basically
repeating the same thing about the
disciples but what I find so cool here
is in starting in 20 I do not ask on
behalf of these alone but for all those
who also believe in me through their
word he is praying to God specifically
for you in this
instance for those who also believe in
me through their
word in that he continues on that in God
he and God are being one that we may
also be one with them through him well
how is that that are we through him by
being united as his body by following
his Commandments by being added to the
church we are given this blessing that
he is uh praying to God on behalf of
those who believe in him and follow the
words of the disciples that were given
to them through
Jesus so with that I would like to
conclude that this this world does seem
to be a pretty divisive world not really
on board with
unity you know of course the question
always begs is that the way that the
world really is or is that the what
we're we're given to be seen you know
it's it's very easy to get wrapped up
and in a very negative head space
whenever you take in all kinds of
different media because is it what we're
actually looking at or is it disguised
to see what other people want us to see
I don't think that the world is
completely against Unity I think people
want Unity I think people want peace I
think people want to be banded together
to be friends and to be family and to to
be close with one another
but I don't think that they know how
because we've seem to have strayed from
the teachings of the Bible our spiritual
walk was never designed to be completely
done by ourselves it's very difficult if
you've ever tried to to do this walk by
yourself it's very very difficult to
continue on the Devil is a powerful
powerful being and he's very very smart
and very very talented at what he does
because he's been doing it for a very
very long time and he's not somebody
that we should just blow up off because
he will and does know how to get to
every single one of us so we need this
Unity we need this community to work
together and we are in a unique position
here as God's Church to help bring about
this Unity to this world to show them
what they so desperately want deep down
and might be
suppressing this Unity doesn't stop at
Creekside it doesn't stop at Florida or
the USA it's a worldwide gift that God
has bestowed and requires of his church
and people so if you are out there today
and and you would like to be a part of
this community if you would like to be a
part of something bigger than yourself
it's very simple God lays it PL or Jesus
lays it plainly out in his gospel to
hear his word and believe it believe
what he has said believe that he is the
Son of God and that he is risen to
confess those words be baptized I ized
Repent of your sins raise again a new
person and to continue on with him if
you are out there tonight and need
anything would like for us to pray with
you you can come up now as we stand and
as we sing
