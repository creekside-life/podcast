I know and I'm not joking when I say I
I'm excited to have Rex back and I'll
tell you why preaching to me is
terrifying and I'm not talking about
getting up here getting up here is not
the terrifying part for me the part that
terrifies me is
planning and
prepping because you're dealing with
God's
word and one day I have to answer for
the things I might say up here
I'm scared of that number one but here's
the other thing God's word is so
complex that my simple little mind is
struggling to navigate through
it the smartest person on this Earth is
going to struggle to navigate the
complexities of God's wisdom in in
Ephesians chapter 3 Paul says God's
wisdom is manifold there's layers upon
layers upon layers it's it's it's
amazing
and so for me to prepare a
Liston I I find a scripture and I know
where I'm going I'm like all right God
we're going this way and God's like
we're going this way and I find myself
wanting to go this way but he's pulling
me in a different direction and he
always wins and if you've preached you
know what I'm talking about and it
terrifies me because what I think I'm in
control of I'm not I'm really
not and the more I I am LED towards a
certain
scripture then I'm led to another one
and to another one and to another one
and I find myself down these deep rabbit
holes that I struggle to pull myself out
of because in my mind I'm terrified that
I'm not going to say all the right
things so I need to just say it
all but if I did
that we'd be here for hours and hours
and hours right and so how do you narrow
that down how do you how do
you simplify something so complex and it
scares me and here's the other problem I
have fomo fear of missing out and I
don't want to miss out on that passage
cuz that's cool and I want to share it
with you but I don't have
time so in saying all that I want to
show you the scriptures that we came up
with uh this week I was led led to the
scripture this is not my plan this is
where God has led me
uh before Rex left my plan was to talk
about the reliability of Jesus the
Loyalty of uh of Jesus and the Integrity
of Jesus I have not done any of
that so let's see where God has taken
us made whole by
God John Wesley says Man was created as
a well-working
system the perfect model or expression
of Health would be Adam before the fall
balanced harmonious human organism
designed for
immortality since the fall the wholeness
to be realized is wholeness within the
limits of
mortality and so the last two weeks I've
spoken about a hole the god-shaped hole
and how we're
filled by Jesus and so you see that that
that slide the first birth we're
born and up to that salvation we talked
about this whole this desire to fill
this void that we
feel and in vain we search but finally
we realize who we truly belong to and
we're saved and we come to Salvation and
through that salvation we are being
Sanctified and last week D talked about
God's holiness and how powerful it is
and how amazing it is and we're filled
with that
but I want to take a few steps back to
explain the
glorification God created a physical
body from Earth and then he breathed his
Spirit into our body the spirit gave
life to the body and Man became a living
soul and then God said let us make
humankind in our image after our
likeness and God created humankind in
his own image in the image of God he
created them male and female he created
them
and then we
disobeyed and so we step away from God
we make a choice that we can do this
better and through our Disobedience
we're
exiled and so last week we spoke about
this Holiness of God that is now within
us this power that we have this this
amazing gift of how we can now go to the
throne of God but I want to explain that
a little bit
more that's not because well I made
myself
holy it's nothing that I've
done so I want to read again Ezekiel 36
20-32 let's draw out a conclusion here
now I will say I've read many scholars
on this text I have have listened to a
lot this week I have tried to navigate a
lot of information on this text but
there was something that stood out to me
that I couldn't find anyone else talking
about Ezekiel 36:20 to 32 but when they
came to the Nations wherever they came
they Prof
profaned my holy name and that people
said of them these are the people of the
Lord and yet they had to go out of his
land but I had concern for my Holy Name
which the house of Israel had Prof
fainted among the Nations to which they
came Ezekiel 21 we see God talking to
Ezekiel saying that he's going to use
Babylon to punish Israel for what for
their idolatry for their Disobedience
Israel we can read um through ex Exodus
they were worshiping Bal Asher or
sometimes
Ash these are false gods in fact they
weren't even supposed to mention these
gods Exodus
23:13 and so they've turned
away from the god of Abraham and
Jacob and through their Disobedience
they're punished they're
exiled in fact in judges I often read
and this this one always astounds me you
read in judges it says and the
Israelites did evil in the sight of God
they they found other other gods false
gods and so what does God do well he
makes it right and at the end of that
paragraph he says and he purged
evil from
them guess what the Israelites did the
very next
passage and the Israelites did evil in
the sight of God and God purges that
evil and guess what the next passage
talks about the Israelites doing evil
inside of God and God purges that evil
and it goes on and on and on and to me
I'm like what are you doing stop learn
your
lesson but they
didn't kind of like what I
do and so we have this scenario that
God's talking to Ezekiel and the
Israelites are going to be
exiled and when they're exiled they're
profaning the name of
God by their actions or maybe by their
words maybe they're so disgruntled well
you know we just got kicked out blah
blah blah blah
blah and maybe by their actions they're
profaning God now what I mean by
that the people the Nations around we're
seeing the Israelites come from the
promised
land and they're saying things like that
that's the people the the
um these are the people of the Lord and
yet they had to go out of his land
what kind of God is
that and so what we find we're profaning
the holy name of God and God says that's
what's happened you've profaned among
the Nations to which they
came and while I was going through some
of these writings and readings I I found
that Marduk was a false god of the
Babylonians he was like the head de
deity he had several titles one which
was Bell which means Lord and he was
worshiped as the god of Storms and
fertility much as the ball of the
Canaanites
was and I found that in some Babylonian
writings that Muk overthrew the god of
the
Israelites and so through that this
profanity has
come so I take it back to the garden and
I think how does this apply to us how
does this apply to
me and since our exile from the garden
we have profaned the Holy Name have we
not we've disobeyed God I can do this
better than
you and I've profaned God's holy
name my choices in following Idols in
following other things than God has led
me into that hole we've talked
about but not only that it's profane
God's name I want to really emphas size
the mess that we've
made and I wonder if the example that I
set the things that I do the choices
that I make now profane God's name oh
yeah you know Keegan yeah he he preaches
Jesus and then did you see what he did
last
weekend or did you hear what he said
about that
person he's constantly gossiping about
Scott over here
lots of
material am I living up to what I'm
supposed to be living up to am i setting
a good example for for those around me
for people to come to God or am I
profaning God's name hey you know Keegan
he talks so much about
Jesus and you know I've I've seen him
skip church so that he could go to the
game on on
Sundays h
I guess the sporting gods have
overthrown the god of
Israel did I just profan God's
name perhaps when I'm being
punished deservedly Hebrews chap 12 that
God disciplines those he loves perhaps
when I'm going through that am I am I
saying things that I shouldn't say am I
profaning God's
name
H so what what do we do verse 22
therefore say to the house of
Israel thus says the Lord God it is not
for your sake oh House of Israel that I
am about to act but for the sake of my
Holy Name which you have profaned among
the Nations to which you came and I will
vindicate the Holiness of my great name
which has been profaned among the
Nations and which you have profaned
among them and the nation will know that
I am the Lord declares the Lord God when
through you I vindicate my Holiness
before their eyes I will take you from
the Nations and gather you from the
countries and bring you into your own
land in that scripture I see hey Creek
Side you're going to make it
better hey Creek Side individual
remember you you're going to fix the
problem
it's not what I'm seeing there it's it's
very simply laid out I am going to fix
this
mess it's like a parent and a child I
don't know but I've had some scenarios
where my parents are like just sit down
don't do anything I'll fix it anybody
been there yeah mom's like
no you've made this mess I'll deal with
it and God's saying you've made this
mess I'll fix
it and it kind of feels like that
frustrating movie to me I can watch a
lot of weird movies the one thing that
drives me wild is the movie where the
nice guy in Pleasantville or whatever it
might be who helps everybody is painted
as the enemy and everyone turns against
him drives me wild and I feel like this
is what's
happened and God is moving to restore
the house of Jacob back to the promised
land of Israel and we see that and so so
maybe we ask the question well well well
Keegan maybe I can do no no you
can't well you know I I could do this
maybe no no that's not what the
scripture is
saying God's saying I will fix it I will
do
it in John 6:44 no one comes to me
unless the father who sent me draws him
and I will raise him up on the last day
it is written in the prophets and they
will be taught by God everyone who has
heard and learned from the father comes
to
me sounds very much like God's in
control to
me Ephesians 2:8 for it is by grace that
you've been saved through faith and this
is not from yourselves this is nothing
you've done it is the
gift of God not by works so that you can
boast I love that I can't go around say
hey look at me you know I preach at
Creeks art yeah I'm cool I'm I'm way
better than you because I did this this
and this
no because it's clearly laid out I will
fix
this sit
down I sprinkle clean water on you and
you shall be
clean I'll sprinkle clean water on you
and you shall be clean from all your
uncleanliness cleanes and from all your
Idols I will cleanse you
let me tell you the story about my mom
and my
dad uh back in South Africa where I grew
up disciplining your child is more like
a
hobby and I know some kids don't uh
experience the things I've experienced
but if my mother said don't do something
you better believe she's going to follow
through if you did it and she
did and as I got older you know
uh mom's hobby turned into more of a
sport because now I could run
away and so Mom would find the closest
thing to her and throw it at me and she
had a great arm and I tell you what an
African mother she's not going to hold
back man I there was a couple of forks
throwing at me all sorts this stuff but
I'll never forget that one day my sister
and I are misbehaving and my mother said
stop and we pushed it just a little bit
more and my mother's a teacher and she
has a set of keys a bunch of keys that
could that could damage
houses and she grabbed the set of keys
at the kitchen table and she hurled it
at my sister and I as we're running it
away and it missed me and it hit mom's
favorite ornament and it exploded
so mom's gone from angry mom to super
angry mom and now now she's coming to
kill us you're about to meet Jesus
Keegan and uh she was behind the kitchen
counter and the problem in South Africa
is that because of the crime you have a
lot of like security doors to get
through before you can escape you know
we always think about people getting in
but you don't think about getting out
when Mom's about to kill you
and so I've leaned down and I've grabbed
the keys and I'm rattling through all
these Keys trying to find the one to
open the security gate and I can't find
it and my sister scream me hurry she's
going to kill us and I'm like I'm
hurrying I can't I can't and finally
just before my mother got me by the
grace of God I was able to get out that
security door and my sister and I spent
the next 5 hours
outside my dad was a little different my
dad was more psychological warfare and
so he would just looking at me and I'd
Die inside but my point to my point to
this whole
thing is
that my
parents had
rules and if I disobeyed those rules
there were
consequences and I learned to respect
their
Authority I learned that from my parents
because I knew what they said they were
going to do they
did and I
I feel like one of the problems we face
today is that we have no concept anymore
of the father's
Authority I see parents begging their
children we have no concept of Parental
Authority and therefore we cannot grasp
the work of God in the heart of man God
looks at his children and says you will
be
clean he says I will
vindicate he goes on to say I will give
you a new heart and a new spirit I will
put within you and I will remove the
Heart of Stone from your flesh and give
you a heart of Flesh and I will put my
heart within you and cause you to walk
in my statutes and be careful to obey my
rules am I going to do anything no I
will do
it so what I see here is the authority
of God
I love what sha said today because of
what Jesus did hm there
again God had to step
in to do
it it's God again it's him again for
what because of His holy name the
glorification of His holy
name so what I see is a constant message
occurring throughout the biblical
narrative uh God is restoring us to how
we were before we were exiled from God
from the
garden by whose authority not by Keegan
by his
authority by what he is going to
do so I find that I've played a part in
making God out to be a
liar disrespecting him
parents I'll say to you be parents to
your
children even if others think you're the
bad
one be patient cuz after time you'll be
Vindicated you can be best friends with
them later but teach your
children how to love God how to respect
God so while I'm still an enemy of God
Jesus died for me to put in a to put in
me a new heart to put in his holy spirit
to cleanse me that's what God is doing
by his
authority verse 28 you shall dwell in
the land that I gave to your fathers and
you shall be my people and I will be
your God and I will deliver you from all
your uncleanliness cleanes ah that one
and I will summon the Grain and make it
abundant and lay no famine upon you I
will make the fruit of the tree and the
increase of the field abundant that you
may never again suffer the disgrace of
famine among the Nations then you will
remember your evil ways and your deeds
and you uh that that were not good and
you will loath yourselves for your
iniquities and your
Abominations it is not for your sake
that I will act declares the Lord God
hear that church it's not for your
sake let that be known to you be ashamed
and confounded for your ways oh House of
Israel
I've been giving a new heart this idea
of this this Heart of
Stone I cannot have anything come in I
now have a heart of
Flesh which begs the question how bad
was it back in Noah's
day their hearts of stone the their
hardening of the hearts we've now
received this heart of Flesh and With
This Heart of fishh
Flesh I understand my my guilt now I
understand what I've done and it's my
guilt that reminds
me of what mercy and
Grace and Holy Spirit and cleansing that
God has gifted me not by anything I've
done but by the calling and restoration
of the
Lord what a Wretched Man I am
right thanks be to God through our Lord
Jesus Christ
so we spoke about the
sanctification that we been made
holy that's begun in me and there's an
abundance of it and it's
awesome and in First Corinthians it says
um therefore if anyone is in Christ he
is a new creation the old has passed
away behold the new has come all this is
from
God all this is from God who through
Christ reconciled us to himself and gave
us the ministry of reconciliation that
is in Christ God was reconciling the
world to himself not counting their
trespasses against them and entrusting
to us the message of
reconciliation therefore we are
ambassadors for
Christ God making his appeal through us
we implore you on behalf of Christ be
reconciled to God for our sake that he
made him to be sin who knew who knew no
sin so that in him we might become the
righteousness of
God in August of 1999 I was baptized in
a little town called Paras in Orange
Free State and August is the opposite
here so it's freezing cold down there
and it happened to be 12:00 at night
time when I was like I got to be
baptized and it was freezing cold I was
baptized in the v
River and you also at about 4,800 ft
above sea level so it is
cold and when I was
baptized either I saw the Holy Spirit or
it was um the shock of the cold water
right but something changed in
me the next year uh we were
cacked and uh two guys chased us in the
car as a car chase they they cornered us
they got out the guy had a silence on
his gun kicked my dad around pushed us
around uh we've been broken into in
South Africa we've had horrible things
happen there we've had horrible things
happen in Australia um there was
injustices and atrocities and uh I lost
dream jobs because I was standing up for
for what I believe to be true I've
broken my spine I've got rods and stuff
in my spine I've broken my face through
people kicking me in the face that was
fun I I've I've been injured I've almost
lost my dad but hang on I was baptized
didn't God you know make me
whole where's the abundance that he's
talking
about two years ago yeah I mean you guys
know two years ago both my lungs
exploded that was fun
every day I try to renew my mind I try
and avoid Temptation every day I take up
the cross daily desperately hoping not
to desres his
name just because I am a creation of God
a new
creation doesn't mean everything in my
mortal life is rainbows and
butterflies understand the difference
that's
happening we are being made
holy there's a change that's
happening but I'm still in this mortal
world I'm still like like uh John Wy
says since the fall the wholeness to be
realized is wholeness within the limits
of
mortality in fact you all know everyone
here is struggling with
something I listen to you all and you
come and talk to me and and I hear the
pain I hear the suffering and I hear the
Cancers and I hear this and that and
I hear I hear financial problems I hear
Agony 1 Corinthians 15:42 let me
encourage you church this
wholeness is a patience game it's going
to continue we're being made whole we
have this Spirit we have this new heart
right for who for the glorification of
God because he's doing
this 1 Corinthians 15:42
so it is with the resurrection of the
Dead what is sown is perishable what is
raised is
imperishable what is sown in dishonor it
is raised in glory it is sown in
weakness it is raised in power it is
sown a natural body it is raised a
spiritual body if there is a natural
body there is also a spiritual body thus
it is written the first man Adam became
a living being the last Adam became a
lifegiving spirit but it is not the
spiritual that it first uh that is first
but the natural and then the
spiritual the first man was from the
earth a man of dust the second
man is from Heaven as was the man of
dust so also are those who are of the
dust and as is the man of heaven so also
are those who are of Heaven just as we
have borne the image of the man of dust
we shall also bear the image of the man
of Heaven I tell you this Brothers flesh
and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of
God nor does the perishable inherit the
imperishable behold I tell you a mystery
we shall not all sleep but we shall all
be
changed in a moment in the twinkling of
an eye at the last trumpet for the
trumpet will sound will sound and the
dead will be raised in perish able and
we shall be changed we shall be
changed for the perishable body the
perishable body must put on the
imperishable and this Mortal body must
put on
immortality when the perishable puts on
the imperishable and the Mortal puts on
immortality then shall come to pass the
saying that is written death is
swallowed up in Victory oh death where
is your your Victory oh death where is
your Sting the sting of death is sin and
the power of sin is the law but thanks
be to God who gives us the victory
through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore
my beloved brothers be steadfast
immovable always abounding in the work
of the Lord knowing that the Lord you
lab in the Lord you your labor is not in
vain this process of being made whole is
happening and there's going to be a day
when even my body is made whole and all
the pains and the sufferings that I've
been through are going to be
gone no more aches no more pains no more
agmes no more cancers no more struggles
uh Revelation 21:4 he will wipe away
every tear from their eyes and Death
Shall be no more neither shall there be
mourning nor crying nor pain anymore for
the former things have passed
away for what for his
glorification for
him because he is doing
that so what's the conclusion here
Church it is a privilege to be
here because he is doing the
work and for some reason he's called
us thank the Lord that I get to be part
of
this not because I've done anything but
because he's doing it for what to
restore His holy name because we messed
that
up and to bring glory to
him so we see the Garden of Eden we see
this fall we see God working to restore
us back to that original state to that
Perfection where we are made completely
whole for his
glory it's all about God church it's all
about him I know we come to church and
we can complain sometimes you know we
complain about each other and oh I don't
like the Sho scottw this morning you
know when we get upset about stuff like
that we
forget that it's a privilege to be
called by god let's enjoy
that and I tell you what God is working
he's calling he's restoring all for his
glory and he will get
it because by his authority he says he's
going to do something he's going to do
it and it's going to be done his name
will be lifted High whether you like it
or
not I love that you are being made whole
because he wills
it and every knee will bow and every
tongue will confess that glorious day
with whoever you are you will know God
and you will give him
glory if you hear him calling
today
answer let's stand and sing
