okay so I heard what you said right I
read some Steve Wright jokes this week
and I chuckled a little bit you want to
hear them right I used to work at a
factory where they made hydrants
but you couldn't park anywhere near the
place Steve rod said I was walking
through the forest alone and a tree fell
right in front of me and I didn't hear
it
I've got some powdered water but I don't
know what to add I live near a pizza
place that sells only slices there's a
guy in the back I see tossing triangles
in the air I have a friend who's a
procrastinator he didn't get his
birthmark until he was eight years old I
spilled spot remover on my dog and now
he's gone I got a new dog go I don't
have to walk him anymore
I walked him all at once he was a fun
puppy and a name didn't stay when I'd
call him I'd say come here stay come
here stay stay wore him out I once
installed a skylight in my apartment the
people who lived in the apartment above
me were furious I put instant coffee in
my microwave and almost went back in
time I went to a restaurant that serves
breakfast at any time so I ordered
french toast during the Renaissance
which is what this lessons about
spiritual Renaissance there was a
Reformation movement Martin Luther as
you know was a part of that the key
leader of that there was a restoration
movement Alexander camel Barton Debbie
stone key pieces of that today let me
allow just allow me this idea that no
one's making this movement this
movements already happening there's a
spiritual Renaissance movement going on
right now whether you know it or not
now Renaissance originally meant rebirth
has appeared in European history between
the 14th
the 17th century in the Middle Ages to
the age of enlightenment basically until
modern the modern age Jacob Burckhardt
who wrote the civilization of the
Renaissance in Italy and follows that
whole line of thinking he said that the
Renaissance was like the removal of a
veil in fact and this is one quote in
the Middle Ages both sides of human
consciousness lay dreaming or half awake
beneath a common Veil the veil was woven
of faith illusion and childís pre-pre
possession through which the world and
history we're seeing clad in strange
hues now spiritual Renaissance is the
idea of removing a veil that reveals
quite honestly fading glory you need to
take that in because that's true it says
that in this text verse thirteen
moreover Moses put a veil over his face
so that Israel could not look steadily
at the end of what was passing away
people wear veils to hide what's fading
so spiritual Renaissance is a spiritual
period when there is a new interest and
a rebirth of the true the authentic the
real the real faith real renewal real
revival of what matters most resulting
in new growth and a more glorious church
and yes I believe that's possible in
recognizing that God is still working on
the church let me give you a scripture
on that now some of you think that the
church was better in the 50s than it is
now I do not believe that nor do I
believe it was better in the 60s or the
70s or the 80s or the 90s or in the
hundreds whatever that is I believe it's
getting better
Ephesians 5:26 because I believe in the
work of Christ that he might sanctify
and cleanse her with the washing of
water by the word now
that's an ongoing process yeah it refers
to what did happen but it also refers to
what is happening it recognizes that the
greatest part of the church may be in
the future see greatness in the church
is only dependent upon us doing
wholeheartedly what we know God wants us
to do that's all it takes
in the spiritual Renaissance movement
which I believe is already engaged we
know that any congregation or any church
that loves its model more than its
mission will go away now many
congregations in churches won't make it
if they cling to their model more than
the mission that God has given us for
example I mean but I wasn't living
during this time but once upon a time
everybody rode around horses and buggies
I didn't see that my dad did except my
dad told me he said he's run 2 or 3
miles to see a car come through town now
we can run the other way to get away
from him right he said that these cars
so basically buggies and buggy
manufacturers if they didn't go into the
Bowtique kind of concept they were gone
soon in fact you'd be hard-pressed to
find off horse and buggy manufacturer in
the state of Florida with their human
transportation though cars took over but
it wasn't cars his transportation
suddenly average people could travel at
a level they never could before the
mission was traveled the mode was the
buggy and then it became the car or the
motorcycle and now it's a jet so look at
the changes for example in publishing
how radically different publishing is
today I'll know what you've looked at
music there's a very different world
than it was when we had LPS
it's very different world out there
photography you remember you had a
camera
remember 36 shots or 32 whatever it was
can't even remember now you can even buy
an instant camera remember that click
click click and what's the last time you
saw that or one that actually developed
right in front of you you don't see
those very
for now so the mission is reading not
publishing and photography the mission
is music I'm from give an example do you
remember 8tracks right what was the
mission the mission was not 8tracks
the mission was music then it was
cassettes and everybody felt the mission
was cassettes the mission was never
cassette it was music then it was CDs
and everybody felt the mission was CDs
and nothing to do with CDs the mission
was music then it was mp3s
oh that's it and then it was streaming
and now it's a lady that I talked to in
my room called Alexa never seen her
companies that show innovation around
the mission hang around you've heard of
Apple Samsung and then there are other
companies there's more dedicated to the
method than they are the goal and
they're gone do you ever heard of Kodak
so churches are just like that as long
as we stay focused on our mission
leading people into a growing
relationship with Jesus and our models
are innovative and are willing to move
we'll be ok ok but when you decide your
model is the only thing that matters
you'll be gone so I see a greater Church
through spiritual Renaissance I'm not
saying that lightly I'm not saying it to
be cute I think it's already happening
you want to catch it or you want to turn
from it and die it's your choice I
choose to live they meant let's see what
we might learn a more glorious church is
freed from condemnation if you're in the
text stay with me
second Corinthians three I'm going to
start in verse nine again for if the
Ministry of condemnation had glory is
talking about the law which condemned
people the condemnation in glory the
Ministry of righteousness exceeds much
more in glory amen to that
for even what was made glorious had no
glory in this respect because the glory
that excels the New Testament message
is far greater than the Old Testament
message verse 11 for if what is passing
away was glorious and it was glorious
Moses on that mountain what remains is
much more glorious
amen to that verse 12 therefore since we
have such hope we use great boldness of
speech so if the church is changing and
I do believe it is changing for the
better and becoming more glorious if
that is the case then what is passing
needed to go a more glorious church
finds Grace and is freed from
condemnation maybe you don't remember
the church but I remember the church I
grew up in no longer worried about
condemnation from Christ oh I was
worried about it all the time because he
may remember that give me an amen if you
remember that Romans 8 verse 1 says
there's therefore now no condemnation
finally learn to verse and started
believing it there is therefore now no
condemnation to those who are in Christ
Jesus who do not walk according to the
flesh but according the spirit for the
law of the spirit of life in Christ
Jesus has made me free from the law of
sin and death praise the Lord I'm free I
mean you free say I'm free amen verse 3
for what the law could not do in that it
was weak through the flesh God did God
did by sending his son in the likeness
of sinful flesh and he condemned sin in
the flesh so I'm not condemned anymore
cns amen I'll tell you what I lived in
church that I didn't feel that way at
all and then no longer worried not only
that I'm not condemned from Christ but
no longer worried about condemnation
from the church I knew the church were I
scared you have what everybody else said
about me and some people still think
that they have control they think if
they pronounced condemnation upon you
then you're condemned if they say oh
you're gonna go to hell brother then you
are that doesn't mean anything folks let
me tell you something that's not true
just because your brother thinks you're
too lost because I don't know
we have pianos behind the screen
whatever they think it doesn't mean
anything because that's just their talk
listen to what Paul said about that
concept 1st Corinthians 4 verses 3
through 5 he says but with me
it is a very small thing that I should
be judged by you in other words you want
to judge me that's a little bitty thing
you think I'm setting up ladies not
because you think I'm not all I ought to
be that doesn't worry me a little bit I
go right to sleep at night
go right off it's not worrying me not
worrying me and then I should be judged
by you or a by a human court in fact I
do not even judge myself I don't even
spin I don't stay up late at night going
boy you're gonna go to hell for sure
I don't do they men I don't do that
anymore for I know nothing against
myself yet I mean serious I mean I know
stuff I ain't done right yet I am not
justified by this but he who judges me
is the Lord therefore judge nothing
before the time until the Lord comes who
will both bring to light the hidden
things of darkness media all that stuff
we got healed and reveal the counsels of
the heart all those things I held in
here then each one sprays will come from
God so as a recovering Pharisee which I
am I'm not there yet but I'm recovering
as a recovering Pharisee we can be
confident hopeful and joyful in the
Spirit amen so so in a renaissance of a
more glorious Church we're freed from
condemnation I don't know about you but
that sounds really good to me and I see
a church that's actually smiling more
than I recall second truth and that is a
more glorious church is freed from
concealment if you're with me in the
text in 2nd Corinthians 3 continuing in
verse 13 until Moses who put a veil over
his face so that the children of Israel
could not look steadily at the end of
what was passing away I find that
fascinating so I thought he put the veil
over the face because he made everybody
scared but he put the vel over the face
because he didn't want him to see that
that glow that he had when he was in
God's presence it didn't last so you
didn't want to see it fade now if I'd
said that on my own initiative read me
Exodus you'd say that I'm scribbling the
scribbles of the scripture so it says
but he put a veil over his face that the
children is or could not look steadily
at the end of what was passing verse 14
but their minds were blind
did four until then so they didn't see
that they thought his face glowed all
the time
foreign did this day the same veil
remains unlifted in the reading of the
Old Testament they still see it glowing
because the veil is taken away in Christ
but even to this day when Moses is read
of Vail lies on their heart they still
think it's glowing back there
nevertheless when one turns to the Lord
the veil is taken away and all of a
sudden they say it's not glowing anymore
I found something else first 17 now the
Lord is the spirit and where the Spirit
of the Lord is there is Liberty I've
been set free from that idea that it's
glowing back there and his face is no
longer glory so a more glorious church
finds Grace and it's freed from
concealment
you see no longer afraid of admitting
that we've sinned folks I remember when
it's time in the church you better be
careful about admitting what you've done
wrong maybe you don't remember that but
I remember that first John chapter 1
verses 8 through 10 I've had people tell
me oh yeah I know what's wrong with you
and they wouldn't admit anything ok
listen to me 1st John 1 verse 8 if we
say that we have no sin and you listen
to that that's the tendency within us I
don't want to admit I've got sin if we
say that we have no sin we deceive
ourselves and the truth is not in us if
we confess our sins that's telling that
loud let people know he is faithful and
just forgive us of our sins and to
cleanse us from all unrighteousness
again if we say that we have not sinned
again hiding it concealing it we make
him a liar and his word is not in us
James 5:16 we confess our faults one to
another pray one for another that we
might be able not high not a lot lying
not being a hypocrite about who we are
anymore I love that I find brethren say
oh I'm struggling with this I'm
struggling with that all along I don't
recall that maybe y'all recall that I
don't recall that I recall you nearly
thinking everybody at church didn't do
anything wrong the last month
little-ass the last week everybody
walked very stir
and I'll be honest with you if you were
honest within it made you want to give
up because if everybody else's got it
right I might as well go home and go to
hell like a gentleman because I haven't
if you've got it all straightened out
and God bless you glad you got it me I'm
a mess okay
I'm struggling every day I'm glad you
got it worked out but I love to be a
part of a church that's willing to admit
it admit it no longer afraid of
admitting not only that I sin but that
we differ on stuff doctrinally oh did
you actually say that folks have you
actually listened to us we've got all
kinds ideas in this congregation if you
don't believe that you ain't listening
to your brother talk I'm grateful that
we're allowed to talk like that now he
said well what are you suggesting that
we should all believe all kinds of
things no I'm not suggesting that I'm
saying it's always been true it's always
been true all the way back to when Paul
wrote the book of Romans Romans 14
verses 3 and 4 says let not him who eats
despise him who does not eat and letting
on him who does not eat he judge him who
eats for God has received him I mean
he's still my child verse 4 who are you
to judge another servant to his own
master he stands or Falls indeed he will
be made to stand for God is able to make
him stand I just think it's great to not
hide that I don't agree with everybody
sitting here right now about everything
and you don't eat you say well well what
if it's important stuff well God a sort
that one out I'm tell you that God I
sort that one out but let me tell you
something it's okay for us not to be
square dotting every I with each other
because I found human beings have all
kinds ideas and you say well well we got
it all get it all right we got your life
all right she's sinning all the time
what would it be a surprise if you're
wrong about some stuff in your head I
know I know you know you're right
but you hadn't talked to nobody about it
lately
and you might find out you know so as a
recovering Pharisee and that's what I am
and maybe you are too we can be
independent and have opinions and listen
to this unafraid you say well I don't
agree with you I don't think you're
going to go to heaven with that belief
yeah you know what I don't care what you
think because I only got to answer to
one Amen you can have your opinion all
you want but I got to answer one right
so you hold on to yours I hold on the
mind will work that we're glad to talk
to you about it glad to talk to you
about it but there's subtle differences
between every single one of us here so
in a renaissance of a more glorious
Church we're free from concealment I can
tell you about my sin and not only that
I can tell you about my weird ideas amen
amen amen walls amen
last point I don't taste some thats a
better Church to want to grow up in
that's a better Church than I grabbed it
number three more glorious Church is
freed from conformity it says in verse
18 but we all with unveiled faces and
he's talking about the Brethren now
behold is in a mirror the glory of the
Lord are being transformed into the same
image from glory to glory now we're not
being transformed into each other we're
being transformed into him and it's from
glory to glory and we're not at the same
place we're not all at the same place
it's from glory to glory you get in
front of a mirror and you fix what you
fix I fix what I fix and now we're not
all fixing the same thing stand in front
of the mirror man and you'll know that's
true some of you are combing your hair
and others of your slicking your head
down so from glory to glory just as the
Spirit of the Lord more glorious church
finds grace and is freed from conformity
so well that doesn't sound right listen
to me no longer afraid and not
conforming to ungodly secularism
I don't know if you realize this but a
lot of religious folks just their church
is just reflective of the world we don't
have to be like them don't be like them
Romans chapter 12 verses 1 &amp; 2 says I
beseech you therefore brethren by the
mercies of God that you present your
bodies a living sacrifice holy
acceptable to God which is your
reasonable service and do not be
conformed to this world but be
transformed by the renewing of your mind
that you may prove what is that good and
acceptable and perfect will of God
so I don't have to be concerned about
fitting in to this world I don't have to
have the right type shirt with the right
type emblem here I don't have the right
type shoes on I don't have to have the
right type glasses on I don't have to
have the right type attitude on I only
have to not be conformed to ungodliness
and secularism well more than that
Colossians 2 verses 20 and 23 23 says
therefore if you died with Christ from
the basic principles of the world
why is though living in the world do you
subject' yourselves to regulations now
you stop not talking about worldly
residue regulations then he's talking
about religious verse 21
do not touch do not taste do not handle
which all concern things which perish
with using they're all gonna go away
according to the commandments of
doctrines of men verse 23 these things
indeed have an appearance of wisdom and
self-imposed religion false humility and
neglect of the body but of no value
against the indulgence flesh I'm no
longer afraid not conforming to
ungracious ritualism I've seen look
let's just talk about women for a minute
can we talk about women all this guys
say amen so so let's talk about women
this minute the I'll remember the
strictness of clothing requirements for
women some of you women sitting here got
sleeveless dresses Oh No
I heard preachers say the other day if
an armpits gonna turn you on you're in
trouble anyway
I attended a lectureship about a year
and a half ago in the Brotherhood and
two ladies came out and look at my wife
all up and down criticising her without
saying a word I don't have to submit to
that listen to me
I'm not conforming to ungracious
legalistic ritualism anymore
I don't have to submit to that those are
man's Commandments you give me one
scripture on telling me where the dress
reaches relation to the knee or the
ankle amen give me give me one tell me
one tell me one that says anything about
the length of the slave tell me one
scripture about bathing suits tell me
what is it I've submitted to that all my
life I've been told exactly what you
could and what you could not do on those
subjects and so many more that we can
talk about I'm just talking about women
right now Oh y'all got quiet now I see
you don't want to come out there on the
edge with me do you want to hang in
there where it's safe yeah god bless you
all right so as a recovering Pharisee we
can be godly and spiritual without being
legal it's praise God amen
we can do the right thing so in a
renaissance of a more glorious church
that's freed from conformity listen to
what we've been freed from in our
lifetime God is changing and moving the
church and I believe it's for a better
thing I'm sorry you may be back there
wanting to believe in a three-piece suit
in the 50s and go to a church that
smells kind of funny maybe that's where
you want to live okay that isn't where I
want to live I want to live in the
Church of God's doing something with
amen I really do wherever that's at I
want to be there I don't to live in a
church where there's no condemnation
then I don't feel like I'm going to hell
every day of the week and twice on
Sunday
I don't want to live in a church where
you have to conceal everything you've
ever done wrong because if it ever comes
out what you've been done you're rude
you can't do anything there anymore and
we'll have you even lead a prayer there
anymore I don't want to be a part of a
church I don't want to be a part of a
church where everything has to be in
conformity either to the world to be
cool or it has to be in conformity to
some crazy legalistic ritual
rules that some churches created gotta
wear blue silly stuff y'all know what
I'm talking about
that's the lesson
what's today's date 398 years ago today
now I don't know if you know this but a
hundred and two were all they could
squeeze on pilgrims there were other
people on the ship
the only 102 could get on the Mayflower
now that group that pilgrim group in the
pilgrim colony that ended up in Plymouth
Massachusetts were brought together in
between 1586 and 1605 and they shared
some theological beliefs that were not
conforming to the Church of England they
as a result they were separatists and
they would not they had irreconcilable
differences in their mind with the
Church of England and their worship and
they didn't go along with the trappings
the traditions the organization of the
Church of England now they weren't like
the Puritans the Puritans had issues
with the Church of England but they
continued their membership and
allegiance with the Church of England so
as a result the Church of England and
the law considered the pilgrims illegal
illegal how illegal well he had to go to
church
if you didn't attend the Church of
England
you could be fined it was at that time
like five whatever their cents are
called of a pound today that's
equivalent to 17 pounds it's around
pushing 25 30 bucks today for one
service one Sunday just miss Church the
penalties got worse for other things
imprisonment larger fines Barrow and
Greenwood were executed for what they
call sedition in 1593 for just not going
to the church finger Brewster arranged
for the congregation to meet privately
at his home and
in this manor house and Brewster was the
presiding elder he wasn't the Evangelist
but he was known to been fined 20 pounds
which is equivalent today to three
thousand nine hundred and sixty pounds
for what he did
William Bradford of osterfeld kept a
journal of the congregational events
that later were published at primped
Plymouth Plantation and he wrote this
and you see a portion of it up there but
after these things they could not long
continue in any peaceable condition but
were hunted and persecuted on every side
so as their former afflictions were but
a flee body in comparison of these which
now came upon them for some were taken
and clapped in prison others had their
house houses beset and what's not and
day and hardly escaped their hands and
the most were famed of flee and leave
their houses and habitations and the
means of their livelihood and so they
banded together they didn't come
immediately to America they went to
another country and then eventually to
America the pilgrims were here what were
they seeking freedom you know what they
were really seeking a more glorious
Church I believe they found a more
glorious church I believe we have not
arrived maybe you do at least I haven't
arrived I believe there's something
better that we should be doing I don't
think as a congregation we're all that I
think we could do better I believe the
church has not seen its best days and I
don't believe this congregation is seen
its best days I think that's a mistake
to think that way
I believe that there is a more glorious
church out there and I know some of you
are cuckoo all these Millennials but I
actually believe the Millennials are
helping us get there I believe the
Millennials actually see that there's
something real and authentic that
they're reaching for and I think they're
right about that I think a lot of what
we've done has been actually kind of
States playing I'm still seeking a
greater freedom of freedom of a more
glorious Church I want to be a
part of that were you free to become a
church without spot or wrinkle or any
such thing that would hold us back full
from fulfilling the two things that we
are to fulfill the one is the great
commandment to love the Lord your God
with all your heart with all your soul
with all your mind and the second is the
Great Commission to take the gospel into
all the world and that's what our
mission is you lose sight of those
things and you will end up supporting a
model and the model will be destroyed
but if you stay on track of what really
matters
we'll be okay so here you have room I
think in this congregation as
individuals and as a congregation we
have room to actually do what we just
talked about that is that we can be a
church where we can push off our
Pharisee ISM in our oppression and have
a church where there is no condemnation
of each other and no concealment of what
we've done wrong and no conformity that
we make up rules that somebody has to
follow if that appeals to you then join
us because that really is the church
underneath it doctrines pretty much the
same but behavior he's getting better I
really believe that if you'd like to be
a part of it then we're going to give
you an invitation right now either you
can repent of your sins confess the name
of Christ and be baptized today and
become a part of the kingdom of God or
you can stay where you are it's your
call if you need to though come while we
stand while we see
