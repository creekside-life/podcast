babies up from the gravey road
when the morning right here
good morning
Sarah and I married in December
of 2005
and a lady to find out she was
pregnant with our first son in
our first child in May of
2006 Our Lives seemed perfect
but that Perfection crumbled
down around us in the span a
single doctor's appointment
September 27th 2006
and what was to be an ordinary
appointment with the hopes of an
ultrasound to determine our
baby's gender we were told that
the life that we had already
fallen in love with
a precious baby boy was over
there was no as our world
crashed around us
and everything seemed to move so
fast but crawl at the same
Sarah's labor was induced after
14 hours of Labor she delivered
our
first son on September 28th 2006
We buried him five days later on
October 3rd in place of picking
out Nursery colors
we chose the casket set the
funeral date and time
and went home to an empty
Nursery
so why do I bring this to you
today on Easter
in preparation for communion you
see this
was no doubt one of the darkest
times of Our Lives don't
remember much about the funeral
but I do remember collapsing at
my son's coffin
it was so to leave him
I didn't want to leave this
period also revealed to Sarah
and I
just how lost we truly were
until this point we had relied
on our abilities we
trusted in our love for one
another a new and thriving
marriage a healthy pregnancy
it will also we never stopped
loving one another but
our marriage struggled and we no
longer had our first pregnancy
what's Sarah and I didn't know
or realize through our grief
was how much we in fact needed
the resurrection of a savior
our son was lost to us in this
world and if our lives didn't
change
he'd be lost to us into any
eternity as well we needed the
resurrection
and the Salvation we received
through faith in Jesus Christ
at the time lost our son and I
was bawling my eyes out his at
his grave side
I didn't have any hope but I
needed the resurrection
I needed the Garden of
Gethsemane and a savior who
prayed
to the father even to allow the
cup to pass from him
I needed the betraying kiss of
Judas and the arrest of Jesus
I needed the false trial and for
pilot to wash his hands and walk
away
I needed the crowd shouting
crucify him
I needed Peter's denial and the
brutality of the
Roman soldiers as they punched
spat upon and cursed Jesus
I needed Jesus on the cross
suspended
Between Heaven and Earth I
needed the nails in his hands
and his feet and
for the spear to pierce his side
I needed Christ laid
in laid to rest in a borrowed
tomb most of all
I needed the empty tomb and a
resurrected Savior for
I on my own have no solution to
close the gap between my
sin and God's judgment no
solution but the resurrected
Lord
Jesus although many times I have
felt like Thomas
in disbelief stating unless I
see his hands
the mark of the nails and placed
my fingers in The Mark of the
nails and
placed my hand into his side I
will never believe
other times I have felt like
Peter ambitious and willing to
get out of
the boat and walk on water to
Jesus but distracted by the
storms of life
and left sinking and crying out
a savior
the story of David and Bathsheba
and the loss of their son from
second Samuel 12
was offered as hope at the grave
side of my son but at that time
I had
no hope I was lost I heard the
words of David
state I shall go to him but he
will not return to me
before being able to go to the
sun I lost I
needed the resurrected savior to
interject to the on my behalf
we are lost on our own in this
world and we are without hope
No Doubt most if not all of you
have a similar story of your own
Brokenness
you have borne your cross and
battled through your Darkness
so I'm thankful for the
opportunity to gather with each
of you
in your own Brokenness to share
the bread and the cut that
represent
the body and the blood of Christ
forgives me hope that
surpasses all understanding I am
not only thankful for the
resurrection
but I needed it for the hope
that provides a lost and broken
world
that we may be reconciled to the
father through the son
bow with me as we give thanks
for the bread God aggressions
Heavenly Father we thank you for
this opportunity to come before
your throne this morning dear
Lord
and give thanks for the bread
that represents the body of
Christ his Brokenness on this
day of Resurrection
that we know that he truly lives
and he is our way to you
bless this bread and all that it
represents in Christ Jesus name
we pray amen
here
you
let's give thanks for the fruit
of the
the good dear Lord we come to
you bow before your throne
and thank you for the
opportunity to take this through
the vine that represents the
blood of Christ
and the salvation that he
provides back to you dear Lord
and it's Christ Jesus name we
pray amen

of our story which is

let's be standing for the
singing of the song and please
remain standing for
scripture reading that will
follow
man of
Sorrows what a name for the
son
change song
here
me
you
when he comes our Lord Escape
morning church our reading would
come from
John chapter 20 verse 1 through
30
John 20 through 30 and the word
says
now in the first day of the week
Mary Magdalene came early to the
tomb
while it was still dark and saw
the stone already taken away
from the tomb
so she ran and came to Simon
Peter and the
other disciples whom Jesus loved
and said to them they have taken
away
the Lord out of the Tomb and we
do not know where they have laid
him
so Peter on the other the other
disciple went forth and
they were going to the tomb the
two were running together and
the other of ran ahead
faster than Peter and came to
the tomb first
and snooping down and looking in
he saw the linen wrapped it
lying there
he did not go in and Peter also
came following him
and entered into the tomb and he
saw the linen Rapids lying there
and the face of the cloth which
had been on his head not
lying with the linen rappings
but rolled up in a place by
itself
so the other disciple who had
first come to the tune then also
entered and he saw and believed
whereas yet
they did not understand the
scripture that he must Rise
Again from the
so the typos went away again to
his own to their to their own
homes
but Mary was standing outside
tomb weeping and
so she wept she stooped and
looked into tomb and she saw two
angels
in white sitting one at the head
and one at the feet
where the body of Jesus had been
laying and they said to her
woman why are
you weeping and she said to them
because they have taken away my
Lord
and I do not where they have
laid him but when
when she said when she had said
this she turned around and saw
Jesus standing there
and did not know that it was
Jesus Jesus said to her woman
why are you whom are you seeking
supposing him to be
a gardener she said to him sir
if you have
carried him away tell me where
you have laid him and I would
take him away
in Jesus said to her she turned
and said to him
in Hebrew robona which means
teacher Jesus said to her
stop clinging to me if I have
not yet sent it to the father
but go to my brother and say to
them I send to my father
and your father my God and your
God Mary Magdalene came
announcing to the disciples I
have seen the Lord and that he
had
said these things to her so when
it was evening on that day the
first day
of the week and when the doors
were shut where the disciples
were for fear of the Jews Jesus
came and stood in the of them
and some peace be with you and
when he's had said this
he showed them both his hands
and his the
disciples then rejoice when they
saw the Lord so Jesus said to
them again peace be with you
as the father has sent me I also
send you
and when he had said this he
breathed on and said to them
received the Holy Spirit you
forgive sins of any their sins
have been forgiven them if you
retain sins of
any they have been retained but
Thomas one of the 12 called
didymus was not with them
when Jesus came so the other
disciples were saying to him
we have not we have seen the
Lord but he said to them unless
I see his hands
the imprint of the nails put my
finger into the place of the
nails
and put my hand into his side I
would not believe
after days the disciples were
again inside and Thomas with
them
and Jesus came the doors haven't
been shut and stood in the midst
of them and said
peace be with you then he said
to Thomas
reach here with your fingering
and see my hands and reach here
with your hand and put it into
my side and do not be
unbelieving but believing Thomas
answered and said to him
my Lord and my God Jesus
said to him because you have
seen me have you believe bless
it up those who do not see
and yet believe yeah many other
signs Jesus also
performed in the presence of the
disciples which are not written
in this book please be seated
good morning church I know that
was a long but it
needs to be read we had a great
day yesterday
a few that you just really
missed a I think just to see the
kids enjoying the day
they're still some opportunity
to make photographs
around the building I think
there's still some candy eggs
out there kids so
think they're not as melted as
they were yesterday so
if you new to us God bless you
for coming our way we are
the Creekside Church of Christ
and our goals are
to worship God the father and
spirit and Truth share Christ
Jesus
with the world around us to be
transformed ourself see the
world transformed also
from the way it is to the way it
should be and then of course
serve the world with the needs
that they have particularly with
the gospel of Christ and then of
course whatever needs they need
in their life if you're new to
us and you don't know what we're
doing here this
building this is a gym I'm just
here a moment ago thinking man
this is a gym we think well it's
a gym and I'm going yeah
it's a gym to you see where I'll
be worshiping the next few weeks
so it's just so much
at a higher level even as a gym
than anything
that I'll be worshiping at so
praise God for the gym we have
but if you want to follow with
what all we're building and you
can go with that cure our code
and look up the finances and
even
follow go through the website
and see all that we're doing we
have a scripture that we a date
go to that just one second
a couple of things I feel like I
need to say first there's a
little
birth going on right now do
y'all know about that Victoria
Wilson is
in the middle of possibly having
a baby right now so being prayer
about them we have a lot of
medical issues coming up be a
lot of prayers we won't be here
but
we'll be praying Lord willing
I'll see you Wednesday night
when we get back which will be
the first I think so that's the
plan but I want to mention
something else to you that
Keegan started pointing out to
me the other day you might not
realize this but I mean money
was taken up to help us on this
trip and we didn't pay attention
and then all of a sudden
put it together is almost
exactly to the penny what
we paid for the is what you gave
that was kind
of odd I mean like down to Penny
kind of thing almost like
God wanted us to go works like
that's what he wanted
so the God bless you they'll be
more said about that later we're
gonna
scripture last we'll read it
together if you would say it
with me trust in the Lord
with all your heart and lean not
on your own understanding amen
amen before we get in the less
and less
join with each other in prayer
pray with me
Oh Holy Father we want or rather
we wish we could believe the way
should we wish
we could believe that we read
every race
every sex every age every status
with respect
we wish that we could believe
that we are
never Covetous of the rich nor
disrespectful of them
father we wish we could believe
that we are always kind and
helpful to the poor and those
are mistreated in this world
father
we wish we could believe that we
care about the lives of mothers
and all the mothers of the world
and all
their babies whether to be
allowed to live or not
father we wish that we could
believe that we have always been
sexually moral and kept married
sacred
on this special day we wish we
could believe we're trying to
believe
we want to believe we wish we
could believe
that the resurrection story is
absolutely true
we wish we could believe that an
eternal
life of joy is really possible
father
may this lesson help us to
believe in all that we have
wished for
father help us to believe in all
that we wish and
want to be true father help us
to believe that Jesus
rose from the dead and is coming
back for us again
and to have no doubts about it I
know father not everybody in the
room
believes it some only wish it so
we all wanted to be
father but help us now to see
the proof of it
and absolutely believe and not
just
wish it to be true and help us
to be the people
we've said we want to be and not
just wish it to be true
we asked it in the precious name
of Jesus our lord amen
back in 1992
a letter came from the health
and Human Service is Department
to a resident of Greenville
County in South Carolina
this is what letter the
lady receives said your food
stamps will be
stopped at the end of March
because we receive notice
that you passed away
may God bless you you may
reapply if
your circumstances change
a family watching a movie
about the life of Jesus his own
television there's been
many of them at this point and
they're six year old daughter
was deeply moved by how
realistic the film was
and how Jesus was being
portrayed and then of course
his crucifixion and death and
how horrendous that is to
observe and really
take in tears ran down that
little girl's face
and looked at the cross and saw
this man
dying and then being laid in a
barred tomb
the reason that they aborrowed
tomb is acceptable is because
they would get it back
the Jews never left people in
the tombs like they let them
and then they put them in an
oshuary and they buried this
little box of an ossuary that's
why you could put a man in your
Bard
tune and then use it yourself
later so
they laid him in the bar and she
this little girl watched
as a guard was set then with
a big smile it broke out on her
face and she bounced up on the
arm of the chair
and great anticipation and this
is what she shouted now comes
the good part that's right
she's a hundred right the
resurrection of Our Lord
changes everything
there evidences of a
resurrection if
you're one of these people who
want to see maybe you want
there may be more proof around
June than you've realized
let me you to this are there
suggestive evidences
of jesus' Resurrection just
found in nature if you just
looked at nature for a moment
is there suggestion that God may
have had a
resurrection in mind all alone
well the resurrection is seen in
the spring when
all our dormant plants begin to
wake up verse 4th in life the
resurrection
is seen in a tree you can a tree
down and then
it will Sprout again in verse
4th into a new tree the
resurrection is seen in what's
called a resurrection plant
actually have a piece of a
resurrection plan I could take
out right now
I've had it for 30 something
years I could take it out of the
book that it's in and put it in
water and that plant
that's his dry and brittle and
if you just touch it it will
break apart and if you put it in
the ground right now and water
it it lives in dehydration mode
and will come back again as dead
as it is right now
and sea monkeys some of you kids
had sea monkeys
you can let those sea monkeys
live in that little packet for
over 30 years
and drop them in the right
solution as long as they stay
dry
and they will pop out again not
all of them will live but most
of them will live and those
aren't actually my monkeys
they're size egg stage of
this creature and then of course
it's a shrimp of sort but then
Resurrection is seed
seen in a seed just Aid have you
ever
helped the seed rot you take the
seed and wet it and
you let it right maybe you put
it in refrigerator or somewhere
cool and it begins
stink something awful this is
dead it's rotting now it's
perfect for
planting perfect but we don't
normally do it that way we
normally put the ground let the
ground do all that work but you
can do it that way and then
it'll burst forth with life
so even in nature there's
suggestions that God had
something in mind all along but
is that the only place no
there's suggestions in
history there's evidence is a
resurrection of Jesus Christ in
history itself
the empty tomb by the way is
real
they didn't put him in an
offshore he did not write and
that's
supposed to David's tomb which
is mentioning next to
in verse 29 and said that his
his body still here with us even
to this day that's my reference
in the sermon on the mouth I
mean Sermon on the Mount sermon
on Pinnacles and then there's
the emergence of
Sunday itself why are we meeting
on Sunday opened on
why would all the churches of
the world meet on Sunday why
would you do it
something happened that changed
the day of worship which was
Saturday
Sabbath and then the
extermination of the Apostles
why in the would twelve men
allowed themselves all
to virtually be killed why would
you do such thing as that why
would you put yourself in Peril
all those years
and preach a resurrection and
then there's
the entire New Testament 27
books still here with us
how did that if everybody around
the thing knew
that they could prove it was a
true how could that happen how
could it be
and then there's the existence
of you
here you said you're the church
how in the did a group of people
small little group 12 then about
a twenty
be you thousands of miles and
the church
be going is there evidence where
you're here aren't
you I think that's a little of
evidence but that's not what I
want to focus
on I want to focus on today what
I believe are
probably the three most
convincing testimonials in the
New Testament
and I believe that they are
undeniable I believe that it's
so unlikely
that they would do this or that
they would lie about it it is so
so unlikely that they're the
three most outstanding examples
of the fact that Jesus
came out of that team and then
ascended back to the father
let's walk through them real
quickly number one
the testimony of Paul the
unbelieving persecutor now
somewhere between 37
ad which would have been about
four years
after the so-called Resurrection
in Jesus Christ and to about 40
That's somewhere between those
numbers is where Paul was likely
reached
by somebody then the latest that
I
want to take you to is when he
records what he says in First
Corinthians 15 that's about
57 ad but in Galatians around 40
ad Galatians chapter 1
verses 23 and 24 it says
but they were hearing only he
was formally purse
he who persecuted us now
preaches the faith that he wants
tried to destroy and they
glorified God in Me Paul writes
this how in the world could a
man who's such a zealot
such an absolute Zealot for the
of Judaism
suddenly from actually killing
and imprisoning Christians
to preaching it knowing that he
could be killed by
his fellow Jews for doing it the
story is recorded in
Acts 9 it's a great story there
also in x-22 Acts 26
records the story but in First
Corinthians 15 1 through 11 he
writes about it himself
and he says last of all he
appeared to me as one
born out of DC and then first
Timothy one verses 12 through 16
he says I'm a pattern
for you to believe I'm a I was
a persecutor I was an insolute
man I did everything against
that that cause that you now
believe in
he says but I'm a pattern for
everybody so that everybody can
once
believe and do what I did that's
Paul
the second one I want you to see
it's not just Paul it's James
this one may be harder to deny
even than Paul because it's
James the unbelieving brother I
don't know about you
there's no way on this Earth
that my brother would ever
believe I was the Messiah I
promise you our experiences
together
there is no way your brother you
know how it is you know how we
treat each other that's just not
possible the way we talk to each
other the way we deal with each
other but somewhere between 45
was changed we know for a fact
this is written March after six
versus three and four it says
this
it's just not the carpenter the
son of Mary and the brother
James
Joseph's Judas and Simon so
James is the Lord's brother it
says are not his here really
they were married at that time
and they were offended at him
but Jesus said to them
a prophet is not without honor
except in his own country and
among his own Rel
and in his own he's people
didn't
believe in him how do I that
well it suggested in that text
but John chapter 7 and
verse 5 says it straight out his
brothers did not believe I
didn't believe
would you suddenly your brother
says I'm the
Messiah the Son of God you're
gonna go yeah right I'm the king
of whatever you know you're not
gonna believe
that it's mentioned in First
Corinthians 15:7 among what Paul
just wrote is that James saw him
Jesus made a special
to just James it says he
believed
in Acts chapter 1 verse 14 Luke
records that he's with that
group
a with his other brothers that
aren't named in that text but
they're there
with Mary and he's a Believer
now
went from mocking him to being
believer in James one in verse 1
he claims himself to be a
servant of the Lord Jesus Christ
so here you have it
first you have a persecutor
becomes a believer now you have
a brother of a man that you
never believed he was who he was
and
then suddenly he's a believer
what happened what did they see
what happened their testimony is
rocking strong I'm telling you
the number next this one may be
the strongest of all
the testimony of John and I'm
talking about the Elder John I'm
not talking about
young John that saw him
initially even though
I am going to mention the
scripture about that this
somewhere between 66 and
98 ad he lived to be there
he wrote we're gonna talk about
what he wrote in just a second
John 20
in verse 8 was read a while ago
it says then the other
disciple who's always attributed
to John because he didn't name
himself then the other disciple
who came to the tomb first
outran Peter probably
wore out some hanging on the
outside breathing hard and then
the other disciple came to the
tomb first went in also and he
saw and it says believed she
suggests
he didn't really believe in the
resurrection before that but the
point
I want you to see is now he is
old when he
writes John chapter 20 that we
read he wrote that right he's
now old he's got at least in his
60s when he writes
John chapter 20 and John chapter
21 he's 60
something years old he is 30
years down the line from seeing
this
he's seen his fellow apostles
killed
he's the last one standing in 90
to 95 ad They're All Dead all he
wants to talk
in first John second John third
John is
Love and Truth you get in the
Book of Revelation he uses the
word love
and Truth over and over again
why don't you talk love
and truth over and over again if
you know you've been advocating
a lie for over 50 years
oh no if he's anywhere true to
what he wrote
he's the most reliable example
of believing this that could be
so if you really sit here just a
moment I know people have
skepticism and they wish that
there was a resurrection because
they're honey died there
loved one died there Grandpa
died
and they'd love to believe but
they only have a wish you know
most people don't
believe in the resurrection
because of science no more than
you believe in God because of
science
most people believe in it
because it hit some right here
in the heart if you just get a
moment here and realize what's
happened here you
have got three undeniably strong
proofs that you shouldn't just
wish there's a resurrection or
want that there's a resurrection
you should absolutely know this
is true
it's reliable testimony that
proves the resurrection
oh there's so much more than
Paul or James or John
John the ponderer thinking on
this for 50 years and still
advocating
the resurrection you know if
it's so
undeniably true Rex why doesn't
everybody believe
I ain't convinced me well
there's a little thing
called free will
you get to decide and everything
you believed up until now
you decided on many
live a life like this I watch
the news program that I
like and I believe everything
they tell me
and I watched the other one
and that's how I approach what I
believe I listen to the people
who
support what I believe instead
of actually listening to the
Bible
or listening to the evidence of
the Resurrection all I do is
listen to the science that
suggested isn't true that's what
we tend to do
a lot of us live there all the
time and so if you're asking why
people don't believe
it's because they chose not to
look have you chosen to look
have you really but if we saw
him alive today let me ask
you this question let's just say
you saw Jesus alive
today I'm not anticipating that
but if you did and you believed
it today
what would you do how would that
affect you I want you to imagine
America okay let's imagine That
America
is invaded and it's taken over
were defeated
put up a fight but they called
us off guard
and we lose they take away our
communication we're not able
to talk to each other all the
internet's down all the
telephone
lines are down we can't do it
cell phone we are defeated
we're relegated to Pockets
around the country imagine it's
just for a second you will but
our military is able to
strategize
and figure out a way to come
back at them and they come back
hard and they
win and they defeat our enemy
right
but nobody knows it the
communication lines are down so
you were brought into a group of
people by the military and they
tell you
we've won okay absolutely true
but
the people don't know the
internet's gone telephones it's
all gone will you
be one of our people who goes
out and tells
we've won would you go out like
this well you
know you know well we I think I
think I think we've won
or without we won we're no
longer slaves
we're not given to that anymore
they're gone we have freed our
sins from that would you not
shout it from the rooftop would
you not want everybody to know
we're free
we're out from underneath that
terrible oppression Matthew
chapter 10 27 what you hear in
the preach on the we need to
make
this the core of what talk about
to everybody out there that
Jesus died
for their sins he was buried he
rose again we need to make that
a part every conversation we can
it was on February the 27th 1991
February the
22nd not teen this actually
happened
Ruth dillow received a very sad
message from the Pentagon her
son Clayton
Carpenter private first class
and stepped on the landmine
in Desert Storm in Kuwait and
was killed she said
this she later wrote I can't
begin to describe my grief and
shock it was
more than I could bear for three
days I wept for three days I
expressed anger and loss for
three days people tried to
comfort me
to no avail because the loss was
too great three days after
she was told that her son was
dead killed
my landmine she got a phone call
mom
it's me I'm alive
he was injured but he wasn't
injured that bad
rutillo said I couldn't leave it
at first but then I recognized
his voice
he really wasn't alive I laughed
I cried
I felt like turning cartwheels
because my son whom I thought
was dead was really
alive I'm sure none of you can
even begin to understand how I
felt
well there's a glimpse of it
there
if you got a call from Jesus
today on your cell phone this
still works
you got a call today mention
that what if Jesus
called you on the phone would
you believe then
gave you some information that
only he could know about you
would you believe then
would you say I got to tell
everybody
jesus is Alive he rose again
in the bed tell everybody is let
it change you
people believe that a lot than
they believe a sermon
you listened to a sermon right
now this is not nearly as
impressive as your life
not even close but if you really
believe it'll change
everything if Jesus rose from
the dead it changes
everything to believe is
everything it's easy to
it's easy to confess Christ fact
you almost want to shout it
it's easy to be if you really
believe
it's up to you Paul James John
they didn't leave it
they knew it was true and they
gave everything they had to
do you believe she
ready to believe and give your
life to him why don't you come
when we stand when we say
time is filled with
no no
anything and all
oh God
and
ing was so ever
you
friends for again still
more closely
too oh to God's unchanging
hand
