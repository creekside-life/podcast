excuse me years ago I had a conversation
with an elder years and years
ago and the Elder had a this is in the
church um began talking about their
children and how faithful they were at
attending church and the like which is
fine um but then he said to me all my
children are faithful because of all I
did to teach them the work I did with
them the work with their youth program
the work with teaching their
classes and he took full credit I mean
literally took full credit for's
children had turned
out uh so I said to him because I'm I'm
always the flying the
ointment I said to him so you don't
think anyone else contributed or helped
with
that he said no
he believed that his wife and him
himself I did it all without anyone's
help so I asked
so again being the fly in the ointment I
said so no one ever encouraged your kids
at church no one ever taught their class
at church no one ever led the singing at
church other than you no one one ever
led a prayer at church other than you no
one ever LED communion at church other
than you no one ever led the discussion
of giving other than you no one ever
preached other than you and no one ever
was an example other than you and no one
ever said a word to your children other
than
you you didn't even need God's help
you did
it well he had to give in on that one
God's help but here's what I'm
suggesting to
you be
careful you might be a proud
parent maybe you shouldn't
be there's a lot of talk about that I'm
a proud parent I'm put they put little
signs up on the back of their car I'm a
proud
parent m
careful because you may be
implying that's what you
did Paul David trip in the book in this
particular chapter he
says if you're not resting as a parent
in your identity in
Christ you may look for your identity in
your
children so the parent identity Quest is
like
this uh but I will say before I say that
I think few parents think about it even
think about what I'm fixing to talk
about don't it doesn't even come across
as a topic that would have anything to
do with raising your
kids but it's a critical concept within
the gospel
itself so a few parents probably
think that they find their identity in
their kids and almost none of the them
are aware that they do it every
day
parenting is actually shaped by where
you look for your
identity more than you realize it is why
children are able to hurt you so
badly it is why children are able to
make you so
angry it is why their
success or their
failures are felt so personally to
you it is why children can make you feel
so
proud or so
embarrassed if you catch yourself saying
I can't believe you would do this to me
to your
child you got a problem
if you're not resting in your vertical
identity in God and in his
Christ then you're likely resting your
hope in a horizontal identity might not
be your child but it's somebody
here and that's not
healthy in a fallen world and we live in
a fallen world full of sin and death and
horrible things in a fallen world if you
try to find your identity in your
children it's only going to lead you to
disappointment fear anxiety and a drive
for control you're going to try to
control everything about their
lives it's going to be essential that
you control their
life second Peter 1: 8 and9 Peter
suggests a Christian life will be
ineffective or
unfruitful if we forget who we
are and what God has given
us did you hear that if you forget who
you are and what God has given us you'd
end up ineffective and unfruitful in the
works you're supposed to be doing so you
may end up looking to your child to give
you what Christ has already given
you your child cannot give you what
Christ has already given you your child
does not give you your
identity your identity is not found in
your children nor in your parents
children children your identity is not
who your mom and dad are it's not who
your last name is that's not where you
get your identity either in parents your
identity is not in your
children it's in God if you're a
Christian and it's so fundamental it's
such a fundamental concept to the gospel
that for me to even have to say this is
actually kind of childish for me to
actually even have to bring this up
shows you how easily we drift away from
the concepts of the scriptures and how
easily we get engaged in the worldly
thinking there are quite a few
indications that you may be putting your
identity and your children let me give
you a few too much focus on their
success when everything is about their
success too much concern about their
reputation or your family's reputation
to great a desire for control over all
their activities or their grades they
have got to make XG
grade too much emphasis on doing more
rather than being a
Believer you hear
that you got to do enough to go to
heaven you're a Believer you're going to
Heaven Too Much temptation to make it
personal if they reject your a a agenda
can't even say the
word if you make it personal because
they reject your agenda why would they
reject your agenda because you're trying
to find your identity in them and
they're not responsible for your
identity it's too to put on a young
person
so true identity listen to this and
we'll say it and we'll say it again true
identity is not
achieved you can't achieve your
identity true identity is received not
achieved gracious parents know their
identity let me give you a few
scriptures on this great gracious
gracious parents know their identity and
they know it's found in God and in his
Christ here we go John 1 verse2 as many
as received him to them he gave the
right to become children of God to those
who believe in his name what are we who
am I I am a child of God who is your
child a child of God who am I a child of
God Romans 8: 16 the spirit himself
Bears witness with our spirit that we
are children of God by the way I love
that passage because it disproves those
who don't believe the Holy Spirit does
anything for us anymore because it's
subsequent to Salvation because it says
we are and he Bears right now present
active so he Bears witness with our
spirit that we are children of God so if
you're doubting who you are you are a
child of God has nothing to do with
anything you do has nothing to do with
your children or anyone else on this
planet it is your relationship with him
that's what matters 1 John 3:1 behold
what manner of love the father has
bestowed on us that we should be called
that we should be called it is such a
great see if you find your identity in
anything else ultimately you're
disrespecting this that we should even
be called the children of God therefore
the world does not know us because it
did not know him and if you've lost
sight of that that that's the greatest
possibility on Earth to have that
identity you're missing the whole point
of the Gospel anyway and therefore
you're not raising your children
according to the gospel it's just that
simple so what I'm going to do tonight
is I'm going to take this passage we
read a moment ago and I going to take
John 13 and the reason I'm using this
passage is because in this text it
clearly
explains Jesus knew he who who he was
Jesus knew who he was he knew his
identity and we're going to look at that
passage and to show you just a few
things that it will change about you
with the way you might relate to your
children because Jesus knew his identity
and because he knew his identity he was
different when we forget what our
identity really is we become like
everybody
else and we raise our kids like
everybody else which is a hit and miss
proposition so here we go number
one parents who know the source of true
identity can know their
hour want you to think about that one
just a second verse one now before the
Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew
that his hour had come that he should
depart from this world to the father
having loved his own who were in the
world he loved them to the end now these
other scriptures are specifying the idea
of our
age um you need to know how old you
are and you need to know how much time
you got and this idea about not paying
attention to how old you are is
foolishness we've seen that even in the
news lately you got to know how old you
are got to pay attention to how old you
are uh 30y old is not a 40y old 40 year
old is not a 50y old 50y old is not a
60y old a 60y old is not a 70y old 70y
old is not an 80y old and this idea that
well I'm 30 I'm grown you get you a
little
bit a little bit you got a ways to go 25
is grown well yeah
sure and not so
much but what I want you to focus on is
you don't have that much time with your
kids 0 to 18 0 to 18 that year before
they're born at 9 months before they're
born and then 18 years old not even 19
years you don't even have them that long
and then they're pretty much gone and
until they run out of money and they
come home but they're pretty much gone
and you and by the way and once they get
to be 18 and and and and I'm being
really gracious there once they get to
18 they don't want your advice anymore
I'm being very gracious cuz that stops
about 14 15 they stop noting to hear
what you got to say but by the time
they're 18 they really really don't want
too much advice the only advice your
children really want after they get up a
little age is confirmation that their
decision is
right that's about it you need to know
their age you need to know how much time
you got and quick complaining about how
tired you are and about how worn out you
are trying to
be and by the way uh you need to be
aware your clock your clock sticking my
clock tick I'm
67 I'm recognizing it amen clock's
ticking brother clock's
ticking no your hour if you know who you
are in relationship to him your hour
doesn't scare
you I'm not afraid of dying I'm afraid
about how I might die but I ain't afraid
of dying don't really want to die you
know in a car crash unless y'all are
with me number next
parents who know the source of true
identity can know their
own let's read verse one and then verse
11 I'll show you what I
mean now before the Feast of the
Passover when Jesus knew that his hour
had come and that he should depart from
this world to the father having loved
his own he's talking about his disciples
who were in the world he loved them to
the end now he's like their father verse
11 for he knew
who would betray him therefore he said
you are not all
clean you know this is not going to go
down well what I'm fixed to
say you know your
kids and you know what they're going to
be before they
are pretty much knew when Heath was
little I knew what he was going to
do pretty much doing
that when Emily was little I pretty much
knew what she's going to
do Bethany pretty much do and they're
pretty much just exactly like I expected
them to turn
out okay because that's just their
personality that was all I was looking
at their personalities is pretty much
what it look like they
were know what your kids will do who
they are what they
are pay attention you see if you got
your relationship with
them if they don't want
Christ I don't want
them I've already made my
choice children can you hear
that they don't want Christ I don't want
them I'm I'm not going where they're
going I've told my kids before I'm going
to heaven you want to go that's great
you don't want to go I won't see anymore
but that's it I I'm going to heaven I'm
planning on go into heaven I'm not
trying to be ugly I'm trying to be
honest I want you to understand this
isn't one of the things I find important
in my life this is the thing this isn't
one of the things this is the thing it
is the mo and you got to know your own
and you got to know when they can hear
that when they can't hear that you got
to know your own and you got to do the
best you can to reveal to them what they
need to hear about Jesus number next
parents who know the source of their
true identity can know their power and
you do have power look at what it says
here in verses 2 and three about Jesus
and supper being
ended the devil now the devil shows up
at all kinds of places showing up in
this wonderful moment the devil having
already put it into the heart of Judas
the scariot Simon's son to betray him
verse three and that's probably Simon
the uh former leper verse three Jesus
knowing that the father had given all
things into his hand and that he had
come from God and was going to God now
an important little thing you need to
get right there is a lot of people think
that only happened after his
resurrection but he already knew and and
it's this is not the only time it said
in his ministry he knew that all things
have been given into his hand but here's
what I want you to see that a real if
you're relationships with him you find
your identity vertically with God okay
if that's where you're you find your
identity then here's the truth then you
know what your power is your power is
whatever you can do to lead them to him
you can't change them but your power the
the gift that God has given you is to
lead them to him and that's what you're
expected to do uh he saves he changes we
don't do that lead them to him because
their relationship to him is the only
IDE identity that matters the rest of it
is not significant the you could have a
Nobel Peace Prize kid and then they
they're lost what good would that
be what would you have done for them
made them some
money no know your power your power is
leading them to Jesus and that he's the
one that has the power number
next parents who know the source of true
identity can know their father you see
if you know that you're a child of God
the most important thing you need to
know is God look at verse three Jesus
knowing that the father had given all
things to his hands and that he had come
from God and was going to God what do I
need to know about that I know that God
made me and that I plan to go and be
with him do I understand all there is
about that not even close but that's
what's going on right if I am a child of
God I know God made me and I'm planning
to go be with God what is it that I can
give to my children that truth over and
over and over and over and over and over
and over that's the truth I share with
my kids over that's it that's the truth
I came from God he made me I plan on
going to God and I'd love you to go
along with that's it who my father is
and then number
nine and this may be the most important
one parents who know the S source of
their true identity can know their
towel see pride is is a funny
thing it uh when you start putting your
pride in
stuff I got a
boat look at my car see my house
you know what job I've got you know how
much money I made last year you know
what my handicap
is you know I can dunk a
basketball what is
it about Pride well have you seen my
kids my kid I got to show you my kids
what they've done
here's the thing you got to learn look
at verses four and
five Jesus rose from
supper laid aside his
garments took a towel and G
himself and after that so he just looks
like a slave
now after that he poured water in a
basin I don't know where he got that I
guess they were drinking some I don't
know and began to wash the disciples
feet
feet and to wipe them with the towel
with which he was
girded menial
task if your identity is in God the
Father serving at the lowest place is
not a
problem if your identity is in this
other stuff we're talking about it's a
problem it's a real
problem and that's kind of where we're
going here
but if your identity is in the father
changing the diaper is not a problem
except the smell it's not a
problem washing somebody's Feet's not a
problem cleaning up after them when
they're sick is not a problem serving
your people at church not a problem
serving people at work not a problem
your relationship is with got you got a
relationship with the greatest being
that there is period that there is
nothing higher nothing greater he knows
who you are and he loves you and you
know he knows your name and he knows
where you live and he's blessed you in
so many different ways what have you got
to be proud about out here in the world
why is that so important why is it well
you see what I look like I'll lift these
weights I look good don't I and that
kind of thing when we get into the
worldly stuff and we start thinking like
that we've forgotten this and this is
what
matters I have this I have everything if
I have
this and so with my
kids what's the problem with serving my
kids not a problem but I'm also not
going to let them take the place of my
relationship with God I'm not going to
go to their baseball games on
Sunday not going to support their Sports
on Wednesday
night they want to go to sports on
Wednesday night they're going to go
without me and they'd be lucky if I ever
let them go cuz I wouldn't I wouldn't
let them go wouldn't
dare I don't care about their stuff out
there in the sense that anything that
would pull them away from what really
matters that relationship there anything
that would pull that away I don't want
it if that makes me weird that's okay I
don't care right I don't care it makes
me weird doesn't matter doesn't matter
so that's what I'm trying to suggest
trying to serve somebody you see Peter
didn't want his feet wased by Jesus
okay I he had an identity problem but
Jesus didn't all right this is the
lesson I I know it may may sound like
it's off the the Spectrum but it's
exactly where I want you to see it see
identity
principles true and parenting or parents
who know the source of their true
identity can know their hour with their
children how much time they've got and
what's important right now they can know
their own they know their kids really
well because they know it in light of
the scriptures and know it in light of
God they can know their power where they
really can influence them is to take
them to this take them to the church
take them to it and let God change them
you don't do it I didn't make my kids
who they are if I had made my kids who
they are I guarantee there wouldn't be a
single one of them in
church not for not for
me the
father you know your father and you want
them to have a relationship you you know
your towel don't have any problem being
humiliated if that's important for
serving the lord so your true identity
is neither increased nor diminished by
enemies or
friends doesn't have any impact at all
well I'm friends with so and so don't
care well but well they're big shots I
don't
care they got money I don't care why I
care about that would you care about why
do you care about that well we know
somebody's a billionaire okay I know
name's a
billionaires enemies oh well so and so
doesn't like you that means
nothing
nothing your true identity is not
increased or diminished by your
children you're not a better person
because you have children not a worse
person because you don't have children
that's just not true it doesn't make you
better and you're not made better by a
mate I don't care what anybody says it
is this that makes you better that's it
the rest of it's not true and your true
identity is not increased or diminished
by your position or your task on this
planet because you have a job that
happens to be important or you carry
around a lot of money the Basin and the
towel are not a threat to you and to you
your relationship with God or Christ the
Basin and the tow the reason I bring up
that is because I've always thought one
of the most brilliant uh poets in recent
history was Michael Card most of you
probably know Michael card
right Michael Card wrote this he said
and the call is to
community in an upstairs room a parable
is just about to come alive and while
they bicker about who's best with a
painful glance he silently Rises their
savior servant must show them how
through the will of the water and the
tenderness of the towel and the call is
to community the impoverished power that
sets the soul free in humility to take
the vow that day after day we must take
up the Basin and the towel in any
ordinary place or any Ordinary Day the
parable can live again when one will
kneel and one will yield Our Savior
servant must show us how through the
will of the water and the tenderness of
the towel and the space between
ourselves sometimes is more than the
distance between the stars but the
fragile Bridge of the savior's bow we
take up the Basin and the towel and the
call is to community the impoverished
power that sets the soul free in
humility to take the vow the day after
day we must take up the Basin and the
towel your
identity if I'm a child of the
king what's the
problem I think
for whatever
reason we see our identity in almost
anything but
him and we don't even recognize it's a
problem don't even see it as a problem
in fact probably some of you think I've
been over exaggerating the position
tonight which is kind of interesting to
me that I've been too strong on this
point but I've been so strong because I
really it is a serious problem we do not
recognize that the most important thing
is our identity with the father not who
I'm parents
of and they don't have their identity in
me my kids aren't Rex dutton's kids
they're God's
kids that's
it if you're here tonight and you found
your identity in anything other than
Christ maybe there needs to be a change
in your heart
if you found your identity in anything
other than being a child of God maybe
your heart needs to change maybe you
need to start talking differently maybe
you need to put the emphasis on
something else rather than oh I'm so
proud of my
family what
about
this I'm so thankful that I'm a Child of
God if on the other hand you been doing
that then obviously this lesson just
fell on you and you're just sitting
there saying okay I've heard this before
I believe that but if you're on the
other hand there needs to be a change in
your heart and great and we'll do
everything we can to help you if you
need to come forward we'll help you
tonight otherwise just think on it and
maybe use your language a little
differently
