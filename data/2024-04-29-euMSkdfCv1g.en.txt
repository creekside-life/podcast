so I want to start off by reading this
this verse to you Lo the Angels said oh
Mary behold God sends Thee the Glad
Tiding through a word from himm of a son
who shall become known as the Christ
Jesus Son of
Mary of great honor in this world and in
the life to come and of those who who
are drawn near to
God that's the Quran 3:45
Muslims believed that Jesus was a very
important prophet of God and that he was
indeed the
Messiah awaited by the Jews of ancient
Palestine like Christians Muslims
believed Jesus's mission was to
reestablish justice among people and
rectify deviations that had developed in
the religion of the one God Muslims
share with Christians beliefs in Jesus's
unique birth and various Miracles
performed by
him however
Muslims do not believe in Jesus's
Divinity and do not consider Jesus the
son of God for to do so would contradict
the quranic concept of God's Unity his
Oneness furthermore since the concept of
original sin does not exist in Islam
neither Jesus nor any other Prophet or
person plays a Redemptive role in human
salvation in other words there is no
concept of vicarious atonement in Islam
moreover Muslims do not share the
Christian belief in Jesus's crucifixion
according to the Quran Jesus was assumed
taken up to the realm of God to spare
him such a fate in the Quran God's
creation of Jesus who had no father is
likened to his creation of Adam who had
neither father nor mother both fashioned
out of Earth's Elemental components are
viewed as direct manifestations of God's
Divine command
be now I know there are other religions
that believe believe similar to
this and so tonight I just very simply
want to go through
verses that uh disagree with with uh
what I've just read now I'm not trying
to start a fight with Islam here I'm
just basically reading what they believe
uh we have some differences with the
Jehovah's Witnesses as well uh I know
with the the
Mormons and so it's just a topic that I
thought let's have a look into it cuz
I'm seeing a lot of debates online about
this seeing a lot of
debates so the reason Jesus must be God
the most important reason that Jesus
must be God is that if he is not God his
death would not have been sufficient to
pay the penalty for the sins of the
world 1 John 2:2 he is the
perpetuation for our sins and not for
ours only but also for the sins of the
whole world a created being which Jesus
would
be if he were not God could not pay the
infinite penalty required for sin
against an infinite God only God could
pay such an infinite penalty only God
could take on the sins of the world uh
and be resurrected sorry die be
resurrected proving his victory over sin
and death 2 Corinthians 5:21 for our
sake he made him to be sin who knew no
sin so that in him we might become the
righteousness of
god so let's go through a few scriptures
where his followers claimed him to be
God because I will admit that there's no
scripture where Jesus says hey write
this down I am God so we don't see that
that real basic simple
um writing but we have a lot of writings
that point to him claiming to be God
so his followers claim him to be God in
John 1:
1:3 in the beginning was the word and
the Word was with God and the Word was
God simple right he was in the beginning
with God all things were made through
him and without him was not anything
made uh not anything made that was made
in verse 14
it's almost like an equation in verse 14
and the word and we know that the word
is God and the word became flesh and
dwelt among
us and we have seen his glory glory as
of only as of the only son from the
father full of grace and
truth so the Word
was God and the word became flesh and we
know the flesh being Jesus
right in John
20:27 then he said to
Thomas put your finger here and see my
hands and put out your hand and place it
in my side do not disbelieve but
believe Thomas answered
him my Lord and my
God that's a big confession from Thomas
if you think about it because we know in
Exodus you shall worship n other gods
right so for Thomas to make that
claim claiming Jesus to be God acts
20:28 pay careful attention to
yourselves and to all the flock in which
the Holy Spirit has made you
overseers to care for the Church of God
which he obtained with his own
blood I mean read that again just that
last piece to care for the Church of God
which he obtained with his own
blood what's the claim there Jesus to be
God Romans 9:5 Paul writes to them
belong the Patriarchs and from their
race according to the flesh is the
Christ who is God over
all blessed forever amen
so yeah Paul just basically saying
it Titus 213 waiting for our blessed
hope the appearing of the glory of our
great God and Savior Jesus Christ second
Peter 1:1 Simeon Peter a servant and
Apostle of Jesus Christ to those who
have obtained a faith of equal standing
with ours by the righteousness of God
Sor of our God and Savior Jesus Christ
chist now I'm hearing a lot of people
online talk about well Jesus is not
really God and he's not really the son
of God and I'm hearing a lot of these
arguments and I'm reading really simple
scriptures or am I missing
something several times Jesus receives
worship and once again I remind you
Exodus 34:14 for you shall worship no
other God
for the Lord whose name is jealous is a
jealous
God remember that time when when Peter
arrives uh at cornelius's house and
Cornelius bows down right and Peter says
no no no no no no get up and do you
remember the time in Revelation where uh
John he falls at the feet of the Angel
and he starts to worship the angel the
angel says no no no no no stand
up so here I have a situation in Matthew
2:11 and going into the house they saw
the child of Mary his mother and they
fell down and worshiped
him Matthew
14:3 and those in the boat worshiped him
saying truly you are the Son of God they
worshiped
him Matthew 28:9 and behold Jesus met
them and said greetings and they came up
and took hold of his feet and worshiped
him
H Matthew
28:17 and when they saw him they
worshiped him but some doubted Luke
24:51 while he blessed them he parted
from them and was carried up into heaven
and they worshiped
him and returned to Jerusalem with great
joy and were continually in the temple
blessing God
in John 9:38 he said Lord I
believe and what do they do worshiped
him Jesus claimed to be God
himself in John 10:30 as we read thank
you Neil I and the father are
one okay well that's a nice statement if
you keep reading that's what I love
about the
sometimes you get stuck you're like w
what does that mean just keep reading
often tell the youths just keep reading
and the answer will be there again his
Jewish opponents picked up stones to
Stone him now why would they pick up
stones to Stone him well he said is the
father and I are
one I have shown you many but Jesus said
to them I have shown you many good works
from the father for which of these do
you Stone me for which of these works
are you going to now Stone me you're all
getting ready to do some horrible things
there for which one of these things are
you going to Stone me we are not stoning
you for any good
work they replied but for
blasphemy because you a mere man claim
to be God that's written in the
scripture so I have a hard time when
people say Jesus never claimed to be God
this he did did and said things that led
to people wanting to Stone him because
in their eyes he had broken the
law in John 8:58 Jesus said to them
truly truly I say to you before Abraham
was I
am now that is referring back to Exodus
3:14 right when Moses is standing before
God and says who who shall I say this
end me I am who I am
Y and so Jesus is referring back to that
and of course the Jews understood this
because what's their reaction verse 59
so they picked up stones to throw at him
they picked up keys and to throw at him
no I'm kidding they picked up stones to
throw at him but Jesus hid himself and
went out of the
temple hm
their reaction to the things that he's
saying speaks speaks very loudly to
me in Revelation
1:8 and 2213 Jesus says I am the Alpha
and the Omega the first and the last the
beginning and the
end the Alpha and the Omega in the Quran
is referring to
God and we have here Jesus saying I am
the Alpha and the Omega the first and
the last the beginning and the end he's
making a truth
claim now we've been learning about
truth claims in youth class haven't we
guys he's making a truth
claim it's it's a huge truth
claim and it's it's uh it sparked some
controversy obviously I mean they end up
crucifying Jesus
so if you want to turn to Revelation
chapter 5 I'm taking this somewhere
we're going to we're going to end
somewhere with this Revelation chapter
5 follow with
me then I
saw in the right hand of him who was
Seated on the throne a
scroll written within and on the back
that's interesting within and on the
back so much information it almost
couldn't the skull almost couldn't
contain it right sealed with the Seven
Seals so your mind's got to wonder
what's on that scroll what is it what
information's on
there and so there's a lot of different
ideas uh the best one I could find well
when I say the best one the one that I
thought made the most sense the Seven
Seals often the Romans would seal their
will with Seven Seals which kind of
makes more sense to me the the will the
will of God but we don't know what's on
there and I saw a mighty angel
proclaiming with a loud
voice who is worthy to open the scroll
and break its
seals now look remember John's looking
at this John's John's having this Vision
he's seeing
this and he's in this moment who is
worthy to open the scroll and break its
seals and no one no one in heaven or on
Earth or under the Earth was able to
open the scroll or to look into
it no one is
worthy does that not break your
heart none of us are
worthy
H it breaks my heart
and and I see the same emotion in
John and I began to weep
loudly because no one was found worthy
to open the scroll or to look into
it and one of the elders said to me weep
no
more Behold The Lion of the tribe of
Judah the root of David has conquered so
that he he can open the scroll and its
Seven
Seals in verse 6 and between the throne
and the four living creatures and among
the elders I saw a lamb standing as
though it had been
slain with seven horns and with seven
eyes which are the seven spirits of God
sent out into all the
Earth and he went and took the scroll
from the right hand of him who was SE on
the
throne now remember we talked about
God's holiness this power this that
emanates from him I don't know how to
describe it how do you describe God's
holiness I don't have the words to do
that I'm borrowing from
him it's immense
whoa and there's no one worthy enough to
walk into that and to get this
scroll except
Jesus one who's able to enter the that
presence God's able to enter his own
presence
right and he went and I have this image
of him standing before the almighty
God like near his
face this moment of
just
wow and he takes the scroll from the
right hand of him who was Seated on the
throne and when he had taken the scroll
the four living
creatures and the 24 Elders fell down
before the lamb each holding a harp and
golden bowls full of
incense which are the prayers of the
Saints and they sang a new song saying
worthy are you to take the scroll worthy
are you to take the scroll and to open
its
seals for you were slain and by your
blood you ransomed uh people for
God and every tribe and language and
people and nation and you have made them
a kingdom and Priests to our god
remember this morning we talked about
God is working God is making this all
right and I see this again it's sort of
the culmination of what I've been
studying for
weeks this idea
that that Jesus is the only one who
could do this that he's the one that's
romed uh people for God from every tribe
and language and people and nation and
you have made them a kingdom and Priests
to our God you have made
them and they shall reign on the
earth then I looked and I heard around
the throne and the living creatures and
the elders uh the voice of many angels
numbering myriads and myriads and
thousands and thousands saying with a
loud voice Worthy is the Lamb who was
slain to receive power and wealth and
wisdom and
might and honor and glory and
blessing and I heard every creature in
heaven and on Earth and under the Earth
and in the sea and all that is in them
saying I want to stop there every
creature so he's not a
creature I heard every creature in
heaven and on Earth and Under the Sea
and in the sea and all that is in them
saying to him who sits on the throne and
to the lamb be blessing and honor and
glory and might forever and ever and the
four living creatures said amen and the
elders fell down and
worshiped Jesus is not a creature he's
not
made as some might
say he's the word he was with God he was
in the
beginning and so we
see all creation worshiping him is he
worthy of being worshiped apparently
so so what does that mean
logically he's God right he's on the
same
level so when people say to me that
there's no scriptures that back up that
Jesus Jesus was God or the Son of God I
don't understand that
one and I read the Bible and I think am
I missing
something thanks be to God for what he's
done because there truly is no other way
there's nothing we could do we were
stuck we needed
rescuing and so God himself steps
in and he dies on a cross for us which
blows up I mean this really
this this bugs me a little
bit the
cross God is nailed to a cross how does
that even make sense how do you tell
your atheist friends what you
believe well I believe you know God was
born of a virgin and he did some
Miracles and he was nailed to a cross so
that oh yeah our sins would be forgiven
have you ever thought about that you
thought about how that
sounds at the very least what it tells
me that he's not remained distant from
suffering that he's become a part of it
that he can empathize with us that we
have a a God who we can worship who
understands us who has a connection with
us when I'm suffering and when I'm
struggling
I can look at the cross and I know that
my God
understands he gets
it and so we don't have a god who's
distant we don't have a god who's far
away from us where we're worshiping from
a distance Praise Him holy holy holy we
have a God who is in our presence who's
amongst
us when we can bow down we can get
excited about him we can worship him we
can follow him because shown the way we
have seen him if you've seen Jesus
you've seen the father
right so what does this all mean simply
Jesus is Worthy he's worthy to fill that
hole that we've spoken about the last
three weeks he's worthy he's
reliable he's
everything if you need
Jesus Does no better time than now you
can come forward we can help
you can pray with you if you need the
prayers
but there's no better time let's come
and let's stand and let's sing
