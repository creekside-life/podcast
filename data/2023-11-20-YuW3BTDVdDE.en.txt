I want to start with a quote from a
demon CS Lewis wrote several books as
you might know he wrote one that made
him very famous The Chronicles of Narnia
Narnia you know him probably from that
but he also wrote a book called the
screw tape
letters and the premise behind the screw
tape letters is that he was writing the
book from the perspective of
demons and so the the story behind it is
is that one particular demon is giving
his nephew demon some advice on how to
convince this one particular Christian
to give up his faith so that he could
conquer him and he wrote in 31 letters
in the book on how to do this so this
experience de de demon if you will
theoretical is giving advice and the
idea behind the book is that as a
Christian if you read this book it might
give you insight as to the attempts and
the techniques and the methods that
demons try to use on us to convince us
not to believe the quote that I want to
Center on today quoting a
demon it
says you know it it's funny how Mortals
always picture us as putting things in
their
minds in reality our best work is done
by keeping things out of their
mind but that in
mind might demons want to keep us away
from
Thanksgiving and with that in mind might
demons want to keep us away from worship
assemblies where we might give
thanks that maybe the thing that they
fear the most is a Christian who would
dare be on their
knees or bowed head and closed eyes and
giving
thanks Psalm 100 verse4 only enter into
his gates with
Thanksgiving and into his court with
praise be thankful to him and bless his
name you see I believe that Thanksgiving
is the greatest strength you have to
defend against the greatest forces that
are coming against you and you should
wear it like armor you see I think
negativity complaining and
criticism are the very things that cause
you nightmare
your negative attitude is what's hurting
you if you want to know what's done you
more damage than anything else it's not
someone else it's what was in your mind
when you complained about every little
thing and thought that what you needed
to do was voice it out loud that other
people needed to hear you tell everybody
about how bad you've got it I think you
are damaging your
numbers 11:1 when the people complained
it displeased the Lord who's providing
for you who gave you what you've got
who's allowed you to be in the situation
you're in you know scientific evidence
backs up what I'm saying Berkeley
University uh mental health
professionals suggest that psychological
clients derive the greatest possible
benefit from treatment in the shortest
amount of time when they simply practice
the attitude of
gratitude a 2008 study found that we
produce gratitude when we produce
gratitude we activate the brain's reward
centers which releases dopamine and
serotonin which are
neurotransmitters associated with
feeling happy happiness and having the
feeling of
well-being the benefits of gratitude
include the following according to
scientific research if you don't believe
the Bible listen to it it reduces
anxiety and depression gratitude helps
you to have more empathy for other
people it gives you stronger
interpersonal relationships within your
family maybe you're not getting along
because you don't know how to be
grateful stronger immune systems develop
maybe you're sick literally because
you're not as grateful as you should be
and it will improve your Sleep Quality
maybe you're not sleeping through the
night because you're not grateful for
what God has given you better stress
regulation maybe you're blowing your top
because you're not grateful I'm just
suggesting to you now that criticism and
having an evil eye about about
everything is what's killing you you
will probably live longer if you stop
criticizing complaining and focusing on
the negative in your life and start
doing what
Rex giving God
thanks that's what we' just been doing
up until I got in in the pull pit right
that's what we were doing every step of
the way worship has been giving thanks
to the Lord so I want to give you and
you got to hold on for your hat today
I'm going to tell you straight up
because what I've got to do I've got to
cover 10 points in uh the next hour and
a half so
uh number
one Thanksgiving is our defense against
atheism Romans chapter 1 let me just
read the Bible okay verses 19- 21
because what may be known of God is is
Manifest in them for God has shown it to
them for since the creation of the world
his invisible attributes are clearly
seen being understood by the things that
are made even as eternal power in
Godhead so that they are without
excuse because although they knew God
they did not glorify him as God nor were
thankful but became futile in their
thoughts and their foolish hearts were
darkened professing to be wise they
became fools what is the road to fool
being unthankful what's the road to not
believing in God being
unthankful atheism or paganism deres
itself from a lack of Thanksgiving to
the one true
God number
two Thanksgiving is our defense against
Affliction so you've got troubles you've
got afflictions you've got pain
what's your best defense complaining
about it actually not 2 Corinthians 4:
15-18 for all things are for your sakes
listen to that that Grace having spread
through the many may cause Thanksgiving
to abound to the glory of God therefore
we do not lose heart even though our
outer man is
perishing yet the inward man the one
giving thanks the inward man is being
renewed day by day that guy giving
thanks for our light Affliction which is
but for a moment I mean if you live to
be 120 you only going to hurt 120 years
the other is eternal but our light AFF
flection is but for a moment is working
for us a far more exceeding Eternal
weight of Glory while we do not look at
the things which are seen But at the
things which are not seen for the things
which are not seen are for the things
which are seen are temporary but the
things which are not seen are Eternal so
Affliction will not
destroy the
faith of the thankful are you
thankful or are you only about are you
just about
Affliction number
three Thanksgiving is our defense
against agitating a lot of folks agitate
you notice that as folks seem like they
love a good fight and I'm talking about
at church I'm not talking about in the
world you know that that Folks at church
are looking for you to say the wrong
thing to they
go some of you would do that probably
already would've been in the building
somebody heyy at you and you're like
what in the
world stop it well how do you stop it
Rex Ephesians 5 verse4 neither filthy
nor foolish talking nor coarse jesting
which are not fitting but rather giving
of
thanks clean up your
language what's the best way to clean up
your
language stop using bad words no that's
not the way you do it you start using
good words thank you Father praise the
Lord God bless you number
next Thanksgiving is our defense against
anxiety you worry you got a lot of
worries can't go sleep at night listen
to me Philippians chapter 4: 6 and 7 be
anxious for nothing you'd like to not
worry about anything on the planet how
do you do it you can't do it how do you
do it but in everything by prayer and
supplication but you better add this in
so you can ask all you want you can ask
the Lord to move a mountain anytime you
want that's your business you can do
that God is giving you that option but
when you ask him to move that mountain
don't forget what you do next with
Thanksgiving let your requests be made
known to God and the peace of God which
surpasses all understanding will guard
your hearts and Minds through Christ
Jesus worry cannot defeat Thanksgiving
if you count the things you're thankful
for it is hard to get around to worrying
because you will never
finish you will never finish number
next Thanksgiving is our defense against
apostasy what causes people to
quit Colossians chapter 1 verses
9-14 for this reason we also since the
day we heard it do not cease to pray for
you and to ask that you may be filled
with the knowledge of his will in all
wisdom and in spiritual understanding
well that's critical to be mature right
verse 10 that you may walk worthy of the
lord well that's what we all want to do
faithful worthy full fully pleasing him
being fruitful in every good work and
increasing in the knowledge of God well
that's what we all if we're going to be
stay faithful and keep going verse 11
strengthened with all might according to
his glorious power for all patience and
longsuffering with joy how does that
happen verse 12 giving thanks
thanks to the father who has qualified
US to be partakers of the inheritance of
the Saints and light thank you Lord
you're letting me go to
heaven me do you know me yeah I know you
he has delivered us from the power of
Darkness he conveyed us into the kingdom
of his son of his
love in whom we have Redemption through
his blood the Forgiveness of sins what
else is there to give thanks for people
don't quit God who are thankful for
that when you quit it's when you quit
realizing what's been done for you and
saving your
soul don't forget it every time thank
you Lord you saved me I don't know how
you did
it number
next Thanksgiving is our defense against
lements a lot of you are scared to death
you young men particularly scared to
death you're going to be pulled off into
something a lot of us are scared we get
pulled off into something that's not
true listen to Colossians 2:
6-8 as you have therefore receive Christ
Jesus the Lord so walk in him rooted and
built up in him and established in the
faith as you have been taught how do you
do that abounding in it with
Thanksgiving Thanksgiving beware the
very next statement beware lest anyone
cheaty pull you you away cheat you
through
philosophy empty deceit oh there's a lot
of smart people in this world folks a
lot of smart people don't try to match
which with smart people let them say
what they want and you turn around and
say praise the Lord thank you
Lord oh people who believe in God is
just so ignorant praise the
Lord beware lest anyone cheat you
through philosophy empty deceit
according to tradition of men Accord
according to the basic principles of the
world and not according to Christ
Thanksgiving h no smart guy
will
overthrow the faith of a thankful
believer you hear me there isn't a smart
argument against God anyway but even if
someone could form a really smart
argument against God listen to me just
bend the knee and say Lord thank you
you and all of a sudden his smart
argument doesn't seem so smart now does
it Thanksgiving is our defense against
antagonism
antagonism is always Troublemaker always
have been always will be you me tell you
who they are nah I won't Colossians
chapter 3 verse1 15 you know you don't
want me to do it because your name might
be on the list Colossians chapter 3 and
verse 15 says this and let the peace of
God rule in your hearts to which also
you were called in one body and be
thankful how do you let the peace of God
rule in your hearts how do you end up
not being a person who causes trouble
everywhere he
goes be
thankful if you're having trouble with
people if you're friction with people
all over the place it's because you're
not
grateful you're not
grateful so be be grateful antagonism is
caused by a lack of Thanksgiving number
next Thanksgiving is our defense against
a
stigmatism that's right how always
thought that the word a was a separate
word did you ever know that that's how
ignorant I am I thought that was two
different words you know that same word
did Colossians chapter 4 verse two
continuing earnestly in prayer being
vigilant in it with Thanksgiving the
word Vigilant means To Be watchful to
really pay attention to be awake alert
really watching so a stigmatism is a
defect in the curvature of the
eye causing Distortion there are a lot
of people have spiritual
Distortion you don't know how to clear
up your spiritual
Distortion if you got spiritual
Distortion it's because you haven't been
as grateful as you should be be thankful
give yourself some time get off in a
corner thank the Lord it'll be amazing
how the Bible will become clear the word
will become clear to you life will make
more sense to a thankful
person number
next Thanksgiving is our defense against
apathy how do you defend yourself
against being apathetic 1 Thessalonians
5 veres 14- 21 now we exhort you
Brethren warn those who are unruly
Comfort the fainthearted uphold the weak
be patient with all that's a lot to do
see that no one renders evil for evil to
anyone but always pursue what is good
both for yourselves and for all so this
is a list of things we all should be
doing verse 16 Rejoice always be happy
verse 17 pray without ceasing that's a
tough one to do Verse 18 in everything
give thanks wow for the this is the will
of God and Christ Jesus for you do not
quench the spirit do not despise
prophecies test all things hold fast to
what is good so those who don't do are
you
listening those who don't
do are
unthankful those who
do are thankful what do I mean by that
just pay attention to who actually
helps who actually works who actually
picks up a chair when we're having a
fellowship and moves
it who actually sets food out brings
food when we have Fellowship I I'm only
pointing that out because we're about to
do that in just a few minutes pay
attention those who do Are Thankful
those who don't
do are not as
thankful it's your defense against
apathy number last Thanksgiving is our
defense against arrogance how do we keep
from being proud egotistical and
arrogant 1 Timothy 4: 3 and 4 forbidding
to marry and commanding to abstain from
foods which God created to be received
with Thanksgiving these are the things
that are going to happen in the future
maybe they haven't happened in the way
we think yet May marriage is being
attacked and commanding to abstain from
foods which God created to be receiv
received with Thanksgiving a lot of
people are now advocating you should
never eat an animal right you hear it
all the time eating meat oh you're a bad
person and commanding to abstain from
foods which God created to be received
with Thanksgiving next thing you know
it'd be wrong to eat cauliflower by
those who believe and know the truth
some of us have vote that down now
anyway verse four for every creature of
God is good good and nothing is to be
refused if it is received with
Thanksgiving wait a second did I just
hear that that every creature of God is
good and nothing is to be refused if
it's received with Thanksgiving so the
difference is
arrogance are humility The Humble Are
Thankful The Arrogant think they know
more than God that's the problem so
that's simple you want to defend
yourself against arrogance be thankful
for whatever somebody sits in front of
you amen your parents set it in front of
you eat it and be grateful for it
quitting acting like you deserve better
food than what you got your parents put
in front of you young people you hearing
me if they set baloney eat baloney and
thank the Lord for the
baloney amen this idea that I got to
have what I want whenever I want it is
just
arrogant Amen Let me hear it young
people amen young
people anyone want one two there's two
young people said they amen
there want ice cream all the time and
play video games it'll kill
you it'll kill you maybe your parents
should anyway so ways Thanksgiving is
our defense Thanksgiving is our defense
against look at these things you won't
be an atheist you won't sit around and
and be afflicted and being miserable all
the time agitation anxiety apostasy
Allure that would pull you away
antagonism being a problem a stigmatism
you want to be able to see things
clearly apathy or arrogance you know
that's just a short list there was a
whole lot more things I could have gone
to but y'all like to get out on
time so
Thanksgiving it's this week
right think about it just second it
defends our
faith because it helps us see what
others
Miss and it makes us want to even give
more thanks have you noticed that when
you get into a prayer and you start
thanking the lord more things come to
mind and it just kind of flows on
you Emerson said if the stars came out
only once a
year everybody would stay up all night
to behold
them we have seen the Stars so often
that we don't bother to look at them
anymore we have grown accustomed to our
blessings Helen
Keller famous preacher Philip Brooks she
was speaking to she wrote him a letter
when she was young and in that letter
here's what she spoke about about a
spirit of thank
fulness it fills my heart with joy to
know that God loves me so much that he
wishes me to live always and he gives me
everything that makes me happy loving
friends a precious little sister sweet
flowers and the warm sunshine and best
of all a mind that can think and enjoy
and a heart that can love and sympathize
blind little
girl
thankful as a
gardener been very
specially giving care to a rose bush
there's one particular Bloom that he had
really taken care of and he had prized
it and it got so beautiful it really was
the most beautiful flower in the whole
garden and this particular Rose was the
best on the on the rose
bush he loved it he cared for it every
day until one morning he came in and it
was
gone and it made him upset I mean he's
like oh no and he thought some of the
mean boys of our neighborhood come in
here seen me working on that and have
plucked that Rose and destroyed it just
to be mean that's what's happened so he
began to vent to the other Garden people
and he says I can't believe it I worked
on this rose bush for months and I've
got got it just perfect and then some
mean Boy comes in and destroys that and
the other Gardener says no that's not
what happened the Master of the House
came in he's been looking every day at
your
rose today he just loved it so much he
wanted to take it
in for his whole family to enjoy
it you know what my Lord if it pleases
you to take it
it pleases me to lose
it why should I complain because you've
taken from me what was always really
yours
amen yeah one of the greatest defenses
is
Thanksgiving it will defend your faith
and it'll make you realize how good God
really is because you'll quit focusing
on all these other
things don't let a demon steal your
Thanksgiving
Away We Want to Thank You
Lord you saved us through Jesus
amen we want to thank you that we have
food
amen clothing amen and a house to sleep
in may not belong to us but it doesn't
matter CU nothing belongs to us anyway
it's all going to belong to the dirt one
day every house you live in will
collapse one day and nobody would dare
live in your house in probably 150
years I woke up this morning
amen amen uh I've I've got legs some of
us don't have legs at work so well but
I've still got legs and I can get here
amen my mind still
works now that means a lot to
me my mind still works
and I could worship God couldn't
you you know what I really don't care
what everybody else does I want to thank
him
amen the
times he's done special things for me
for
you at times he came to the rescue and
he
healed
the times he rescued me from what
someone meant to do to
me the times he's protected
me the times he just provided for
me my
wife my
mate my
kids
grandkids Lord thank you for my
enemies they did me so much good they
showed me what I needed to do
different thank you for this church
amen it's your defense not the church
even though that is true too just being
thankful and so if you're sitting there
and you've never given your life to the
Lord you probably aren't as thankful as
the rest of us amen I mean I'm grateful
to be right with God Amen it's not
because I'm right with God did you did
you here earlier they uh the one that
owed 50 and the one that owed 500
neither one had anything to
pay I got nothing I got nothing I can
do but I can't give
thanks if you want to come and give your
life to the Lord that's great we'd love
to be a part of that that's on
you if you don't want to that's it's on
you ain't that wonderful that we serve a
God that says you know you don't have
to but it's
here makes me more thankful amen so you
have an opportunity if you're not right
with God to come forward in just a
moment in this song and get right and
live eternally it's your call would you
repent of your sins confess Christ be
baptized today would you come back to it
whatever your need but if you don't need
to come I tell you what you do need to
do thank the Lord amen

say it with me thank the Lord thank Lord
