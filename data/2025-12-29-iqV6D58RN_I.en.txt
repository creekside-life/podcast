There's a dinosaur in Wiggle Town. A
groovy dinosaur who likes to dance
around. She dances to the beat. As she's
going down the street, everybody stops
to do and do the dippy dippy doo. And we
go dippy dippy dippy dippy dippy dippy
doo. And we go dippy dippy dippy dippy
dippy doo. Why in the world do I know
that song?
I did not set out to learn the words to
that song. I did not intentionally go
and learn that song. I do not like
listening to that song,
but I know the words to that song. I
know the whole threeinut version.
And it's because my son loves Dippydoo.
Dippy again. And so we play Dippy. And
we play Dippy in the car. And I don't
want to learn the words, but now I know
them.
It's so bad that I wake up at 3:00 in
the morning. I'm saying, "Let's play
hide and seek. Let's play hide and seek.
I'll You hide and I'll count. Let's play
hide-and-seek." 3:00 in the morning, I
kid you not, I'm singing that song in my
head. I wake up and it's there. It's the
weirdest thing. You don't wake up and
think about it. It's just as I wake up,
I'm like, "What is going on? I've lost
control, right?"
It gets funnier because so I have a
part-time job uh like on my day off
which if there isn't even such a thing
on in ministry but on my day off I go
and fly for a company uh aerial
photography and while I'm flying the
person's doing the photography all
around Florida and it's busy and I'm
talking to air traffic control and I'm
you know looking where we can land in
case of emergency and I'm I'm
calculating all the things. I'm looking
at the the the oil temperatures and
pressures and I'm I'm calculating all
this stuff, but in my head I'm singing,
"Moon, moon, moon, shine so bright.
Moon, moon, moon, my nightlight." It's
my son's songs and they're constantly in
my head.
And it's kind of frustrating, but it
really got me thinking about the
repetition
that we could apply scripturally.
And uh this this really this quite
interesting because Rex and I spoke
about this two weeks ago. I knew what he
was going to do this morning, but I also
plan to do the same thing and actually
talk about the neuroplasticity of the
the brain. So I think that's a God sign.
So I'm going to talk about it again
maybe a little bit differently, but uh
bear with me.
So, we often think of renewal as a
one-time event, a uh a lightning bolt of
inspiration. But the Bible and modern
science agree transformation is a daily
rhythm. We suffer from spiritual
amnesia. If I say spiritual amnesia, you
all know what I'm talking about.
One day you are on fire for God and
nothing can stop that in your brain and
then a week later you've completely
forgotten. We all suffer from that
spiritual amnesia. we forget who God is
and who we are in him the moment we step
into a crisis. But I've also noticed
when we get too comfortable,
you know, there's that that two sides of
the coin.
So to combat this, we uh must remove the
toxic paths and implement paths of
righteousness
uh through the power of repetition.
Repetition, repetition, repetition. It's
everywhere in the Bible. We do it every
Sunday.
Uh it shouldn't be a shock to you. But
Romans 12:2 Rex read this morning as
well. Do not be conformed to this world,
but be transformed by the renewal of
your mind that by testing you may
discern what is the will of God, what is
good and acceptable and perfect. So the
science uh that Rex is speaking about
this morning, I actually read a book by
Dr. Caroline Leaf on neuroplasticity and
she was saying the same stuff. Her book
is switch on your brain.
And she explains that our thoughts are
physical. They occupy mental real
estate. And when we think we build, and
I like the way she puts it, we build
trees.
Interesting tree of knowledge. You know,
if we go down that road, but we build
these trees. She talks about
neurogenesis. the idea that uh the birth
of new neurons,
it seems like God has designed your
brain to be capable of change every
single morning. There's this new neurons
being formed just by thinking.
Uh there's a synaptic pruning she talks
about as we abstain from every form of
evil, we stop firing certain neural
pathways. It's like a garden.
You've got weeds in the garden and if
you stop watering the weeds, they're
going to go away eventually, right? We
start to prune those those toxic
thoughts.
Um, they eventually wither away.
And then she talks about long-term
potentiation. Potentiation. This is the
strengthening of signapses based on
recent patterns of activity. By holding
fast to what is good, we physically
strengthen the godly pathways in our
brains.
the strengthening of recent patterns of
activity and we go dippy dippy dippy
dippy dippy do right because that's all
I'm hearing lately it's in the car it's
at home and in fact Vic and I had our
first we went to uh Kase's wedding case
not went to his wedding last week it's
the first time we driven a long distance
without callum and Vic gets in the car
she's like we can listen to whatever we
want to what do you want to listen to I
went dippy
But it's it's kind of ingrained in me
and it's annoying,
right? But you you know what I'm I'm
getting at here. It's just it's just
happening to me and I really want to
turn this into to scripture and singing
God's songs.
So I look at the Hebrew word of uh
meditation to meditate isn't isn't
simply just to empty the mind, but it's
to fill it. It means to mutter or to
chew. So I think of a lion in Africa.
And when I was a kid growing up in
Africa, my dad used to take us into the
bush four or five times a year. And the
one time he took us to a a watering hole
really early in the morning and we we
lay there just watching and the lion
lions came down and impala came down and
there's crocodiles and hippos and it's
it's really cool to watch. But the lion
chased one of the impalas and he got him
and he got his kill. Got his breakfast
really. But he didn't
take a bite and then leave.
I mean, he sits down to a meal, you
know, and his his family's there with
him and they sit and they chew and they
they take time and they get those
nutrients, right? The same idea here.
They they know at it. It's it's just a
constant gnawing and and chewing and and
try and get every bit of nutrients out
of that. And I kind of look at God's
word like that that we need to sit down
and feast.
I want it I want it in my mouth. I want
it in my stomach. I want it in my veins.
I want it to go into my head. I want it
to move down to my heart so that I wake
up singing godly songs and not hide and
seek. Right?
I also like the idea that another animal
comes near that lion and he kind of
snaps at him.
I kind of like that selfish idea that I
am feasting on God's word right now.
Don't disturb me.
Yeah.
When I was in India, this is a fun
story. Uh we were playing cricket in
India a while ago. So we're a touring
team. Uh, and
there was a big team meeting supposed to
happen and my my teammate and I were
supposed to be there. We're running a
bit late because we had found a
restaurant in India that served the best
creme brules I've ever had in my life
and it's small. So, I would order one
and I'd eat it. And I I was so amazed by
this taste and so just
just lost in this this creme brulee that
my friend Clint is talking to me. My
teammate's talking to me and I actually
just said, "Clint, just just stop
speaking. I'm not even listening." I
genuinely wasn't listening. And I
ordered another one. And I ordered
another one. And I ordered another one.
And eventually they organized the team
tour guide to come. And apparently he
spoke to the chef in Indian and told
him, "Tell this guy that there's no more
creme brules left
because we need to go to a meeting." So
the chef came and told me, "There's no
more creme brules." And then we went and
then Chris admitted to me, he's like,
"Oh, sorry, Gigan, but uh but I was so
engrossed in this taste and this just
this wonderful experience.
I wish I wish feasting on God's word I
was more like that. I want to be more
like that.
So repetition, repetition.
First point, reading the Bible,
repetitive reading. I mean, these are
easy points,
but it needs to be said.
Repetition starts with the word. If we
don't input the truth, we have nothing
to mutter. We internalize the truth,
moving from the head to the heart. In
Joshua 1:8, "The book of the law shall
not depart from your mouth, but you
shall meditate on it day and night, so
that you may be careful to do according
to all that is written in it, for then
you will make your way prosperous, and
then you will have good success." It
sounds like a promise to me.
Psalm 1 verse two
but his delight is in the law of the
Lord and on his law he meditates day and
night
day and night church.
Deuteronomy 6 6-9.
And these words that I command you today
shall be on your heart. You shall teach
them diligently to your children and
shall talk of them when you sit in your
house and when you walk by the way and
when you lie down and when you rise. You
shall bind them as a sign on your hand
and they shall be as frontlets between
your eyes. You shall write them on your
on the doorpost of your house and on
your gates. I hope one day Callum and I
can have conversation where he asks me
scriptural biblical questions and I'm
able just to just to share in that with
him and have that knowledge on my heart
to to to share it with Callum. Right?
Put it on your hearts. Put it on your
minds. Meditate on it. Chew on it.
Continually read God's word repetitive.
In that way, what Dr. Cleaf is talking
about, we identify the pruning that's
needed. We identify the negative
thoughts that Rex was talking about this
morning. And now that I have God's word
on my heart, I can replace those
negative thoughts with what God is
saying. And now I start to reinforce
what God really wants me to be
reinforcing. My life changes. I'm
happier. Uh there's less depression.
There's joy. There's there's the peace.
You've ever been in a place where you've
read the Bible
day in day out and then all of a sudden
there's a peace in you. Has anyone ever
experienced that? It's the coolest
thing. I don't know how to explain that,
but it's there. I want more of that.
Second point,
steadfast singing.
God designed music with repetition
because it bypasses our logic and
settles in our spirits. In heaven, the
angels repeat, "Holy, holy, holy." Not
because they are bored,
but because the glory of God is an
infinite well. Seeing, and I love this,
seeing new facets of God's glory every
time they say it. The infinite
never ending. Lord God, our King. Holy,
holy, holy. If it's good enough for
them, it's good enough for me.
I love this one. Psalm 136 wonder. If
you got your Bibles, turn to Psalm 136
for me. Um, just have a look down the
page just to to prove this repetition
point. It says verse 1:4. I'll just
read. Give thanks to the Lord for he is
good for his steadfast love endures
forever.
Give thanks to the God of gods for his
steadfast love endures forever. Give
thanks to the Lord of lords for his
steadfast love endures forever. To him
who alone does great wonders for his
steadfast love endures forever. And it
goes down the page 26 times. For his
steadfast love endures forever,
embiding it on our hearts.
Repetition is good, church.
Colossians 3:16, "Let the word of Christ
dwell in you richly, teaching and
admonishing one another in all wisdom,
singing psalms and hymns and spiritual
songs with thankfulness in your hearts
to God."
Church, I know some of us don't sing.
It's easy to look around and you know
someone's just sitting there whatever.
But what I'm seeing here in the
scriptures and what I'm experiencing
we really need to sing sing out. It's
good for us. It's changing our brains
literally. It's changing our hearts.
It's not just it's not just worshiping
God. You get something out of that, too.
It's changing your life. Sing out loud.
Imagine singing It is well with my soul.
It is well with my soul.
It is well with my soul. What an amazing
thing to proclaim. It is well with my
soul. But we believe that footsteps
trod. Do you really believe? We believe
it. What time is it? Let's go to lunch.
Do you believe? Proclaim it. It's
changing you.
And hopefully in I I pray and I pray
this happens to me that I wake up at
3:00 a.m. and I'm singing those songs
and and I have before, but I just I want
to be there all the time instead of
singing crazy stuff and thinking about
silly things.
I'd much rather wake up to that.
Repetition, repetition, repetition,
church. There's goodness in it.
Point three, persist in praying.
Says in first Thessalonians that was
read by Ethan, pray without ceasing. So
you're aligning yourself with God's
will. Repetitive persistent prayer isn't
about changing God's mind, church. It's
about refining our hearts and
acknowledging him as our constant
source.
Prayer is the ultimate tool for that
long-term uh potentiation
that Dr. belief is talking about it is
the constant firing of the mind towards
God. Even Jesus in his agony used
repetition.
I'll show you that. But first I want to
go to Luke chapter 18 verse one and I'll
read uh through to verse 8.
Notice the repetition here. And he told
them a parable to the effect that they
ought always to pray and not lose heart.
He said, "In a certain city there was a
judge who neither feared God nor
respected uh man,
and there was a widow in that city who
kept coming to him and saying, "Give me
justice against my adversary."
For a while he refused.
But afterward he said to himself,
"Though I neither fear God nor respect
man, yet because this widow keeps
bothering me,
I will give her justice so that she will
not beat me down by her continual
coming." I love this. And the Lord said,
"Hear what the unrighteous judge says.
And will not God give justice to his
elect who cry to him day and night? Will
he delay long over them? I tell you, he
will give just justice to them speedily.
Nevertheless, when the son of man comes,
will he find faith on earth. This idea
of not even a an unrighteous judge
when when pested
is going to do something about it. And
then you have God who loves us and cares
for us so deeply.
What do you think he's going to do? So
our repetitive persistent prayer, I
think, is a good thing. And church, I
think we need more of it.
Let's let's pray about the building.
Let's pray about what we're trying to do
over and over and over and over again.
Let's let's ask God to help us, right?
The struggles that we see in the world.
and and some of us have seen some of the
evil in the world and know about the
evil that's going on. We should be on
our knees every day just pestering God,
please stop this. Please stop this.
Please stop this. Please, please, Lord,
stop this. And I'm not talking about
vain babble that Jesus talks about in
Matthew 6. Vain babel where people do
long words and you know in public
places. No, no. I'm talking about having
a relationship
with your father
and every day, father, please end this.
Please end this. He knows what's on your
heart. Who's really changing in that
scenario?
It's us. Our minds are changing. Our our
spirit is changing. We are becoming more
perfected. I like what Rick said at the
end there that you come you think more
like Jesus, you become more like Jesus.
That's obvious.
Speaking of Jesus in Matthew 26:44,
Jesus said, uh, well, sorry. So leaving
them again, he went away and prayed for
the third time. Third time, saying the
same words again.
Repetition.
If it's good enough for Jesus,
it's good enough for me.
Final point and then I'll be done.
Aggressive attendance,
holding fast to what is good. We cannot
rewire our brains if in isolation. We
need the synaptic pruning that happens
through community accountability and the
neurogenesis genesis of hearing the word
preached. Hebrews 10:23-25. Let us hold
fast the confession of our hope without
wavering.
For he who promised is faithful.
And let us consider how to stir up one
another to love and good works, not
neglecting to meet together, as is the
habit of some, but encouraging one
another. And all the more as you see the
day drawing near.
We come to church every Sunday, yes, to
worship God, but to be transformed, to
to be in this community, to to transform
our minds.
Don't miss church, guys. Um, there are
168 hours in a week.
You want to change your toxic pathways?
Look at the math. 1 hour of church, it's
6%
of your week. 2 hours, 1.19%
of your week. 3 hours, 1.79%
of your week. And for most of us, four
hours. We come to church Wednesday
nights, Sunday nights, Sunday mornings,
Bible study. It's about 2.38% of our
week. Whoa.
2%.
2% of godly trees in our minds against
98% of a wild
forest.
How are we supposed to compete with
that?
I know 168 hours of the week. I know a
lot of that is sleeping. I'd love my
dreams to be dreaming about God and his
word and get into that that I just
imagine what we could do. We're so
powerful. We I don't think we realize
how powerful we are. The idea that we
can change our our brain matter, our
pathways just by a thought, that blows
my mind.
I know this is uncomfortable for some,
but in second Peter chapter 1, let me
just try and take the target off the
messenger over here.
Second Peter 1 12-15, Peter says,
"Therefore, I intend always to remind
you of these qualities,
though you know them and are established
in the truth that you have." You guys
know everything I've said, you know, to
be true. I'm just reminding you. I'm
reminding myself because every week we
need to be reminded
that repetition.
Verse 13, I think it right as long as I
am in this body to stir you up by way of
reminder since I know that the putting
off of my body will be soon as the Lord
Jesus Christ made it clear to me. And I
will make every effort so that after my
departure you may be able to at any time
uh at any time to recall these things.
Repetition, repetition, repetition so
that we can recall
what Jesus wants us to be like and and
to be.
So in conclusion, I want to finish with
the persistent friend.
If repetition works on the grumpy
neighbor,
how much more does our repetition and
prayer move the heart of a loving
father? Turn to Luke 11 verse 5-10 if
you want to follow with me. Luke 11
5-10.
And he said to them,
"Which of you has a friend
who has a friend will go to him at
midnight and say to him, "Friend, lend
me three loaves, for a friend of mine
has arrived on a journey, and I have
nothing to set before him." And he will
answer from within, "Do not bother me.
The door is now shut, and my children
are in bed uh with me in bed. I cannot
get up and give you anything. I tell you
though, he will not get up and give him
anything because he is his friend. Yet
because of his impotence, his rudeness,
or his lack of respect, he will rise and
give him whatever he needs.
And I tell you, ask and it will be given
to you. Seek and you will find. Knock
and the door will be open to you. For
everyone who asks and the one who seeks
finds. Until the one who knocks it will
be opened.
If this is what the rude, grumpy
neighbor will do,
how much more will God do for us?
So, I don't think it's a bad thing to
persistently pray, to continually sing,
cry out to God over and over and over
and over and over again.
So over Christmas, I'm outside with
Callum and uh
he falls over. He's holding one of those
croquet things in the Kelly's backyard
and he falls over and
your initial reaction as a father, I
just want to dive in there and rescue my
son and pick him up because he's fallen
over. He's hurt and I I I desperately
want to get in there and it takes every
ounce of me to fight to stop myself from
doing that cuz he needs to learn. And so
part of me jumps like, "No, no, no. You
got to wait, wait, wait." And he he
cries a little bit. I'm like, "Nope.
Come on, buddy. Figure it out. Pick
yourself up." And he's struggling. And
now his legs are crossed in a way and he
can't get up. And I'm like, "Ah, I just
want to go rescue my son. I want to pick
him up. I want to make it easy for him.
I love this kid to death.
But I know that if I do that, he's not
going to learn.
And so finally, he gets up and he
figures it out and he's all happy and
off he goes. But if I'm like that with
Callum, how much more is God like that
with us?
God looking down on us, I want to help
my son, but he needs to learn. And if
I'm crying out to God, how much more is
he going to help me?
But it comes at this repetition that we
need to keep reminding ourselves of who
we are, who we belong to, who we serve
to a point where it's on our hearts
daily.
It's on our hearts at 3:00 in the
morning. It's on our hearts when we're
driving. It's on our hearts when when we
when I'm brushing my teeth.
So, I want to challenge you this week,
church. Revelation 4:8. This is an easy
one.
something to mutter on this week. Learn
it. Say it out loud a lot. Mutter on it.
Chew on it. Repeat it. Build a new tree
in your mind. 4:8. And the four living
creatures, each of them with six wings
are full of eyes all around. And within
and day and night they never cease to
say. Here it is. Holy, holy, holy is the
Lord God Almighty who was and is and is
to come.
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God
Almighty who was and is and is to come.
Mutter on that for the next week. It's
an easy scripture.
It's good enough for the angels. It's
good enough for me. He is our king and I
want everything to do with him. I want
to know all about him. And that requires
me to be intentional about what I'm
reading, what I'm doing, how I'm
singing, how I'm praying, and my
attendance at church.
If you need him, if you need prayers for
the congregation,
now is the time as we uh stand and sing.
