Terry, I succumb to peer pressure and I
will wear a tie tonight, but I'm not
going to wear a coat. I wanted to wear a
Dwight Eper Hawaiian fly shirt, but my
wife wouldn't let me do that. So, so
here I am. Good evening,
Creekide. It's finally my turn. Uh,
tonight's the deadline to get tickets to
the dinner. If you want to come Saturday
night to the dinner, I've got to get
numbers in. You can still get tickets
later. You just may not have a meal when
you get here because we got to order the
meals in the
morning. On Sunday nights, we've been
hearing for the last several months from
the leaders of this congregation, from
the elders and deacons and ministry
leaders, and we're finally getting down
toward the end of the list. I don't know
whether to be excited or insulted that
I'm toward the end of the list, but here
I am.
I think I know just about everybody in
here, but just in case if we haven't
met, if I hadn't shook your hand yet,
I'm Jim Madair and I've been a deacon
here since 2000. Uh I'm currently
serving in the building and grounds
community
committee under Rob Height. And building
and grounds is probably the least
glamorous of all the ministries you can
be in. We've just hired somebody new
right here because that's what we do. We
clean the floors. And so AJ, uh, we've
got a job for you. Uh, least glamorous
coach. You never see what we do. We work
behind the scenes. You know, we're the
one that gets the call when something
breaks or when something needs to be
built or repaired. We spray for bugs so
that we don't have them in here. And we
get the call when the lights go out,
when something breaks, or when the
toilets don't work. Now, that's the job
for anybody who wants to come help us. I
also mow the grass and trim the trees
over around the office. But tonight, I'm
honored to be asked to speak. I've been
going to church here for almost 26 years
now. And during that time, I've led
singing many times. I've taught numerous
Bible classes, cooked a lot of meals, uh
been a cook at camp for the last 12
years. was a driver of the bus until a
big tree decided to destroy it a couple
of years ago. But this is the first time
I've ever been asked to preach. There's
probably a reason for
that. I'll let you decide that after we
finish
tonight. But I've got 26 years worth of
notes saved up. So just make yourself
comfortable tonight. We may be here a
while. Hopefully, we won't say anything
too controversial tonight and say
something that will encourage us as we
do our Christian walk every day. Would
you pray with me before we
begin? Our Father, who art in heaven,
holy is your name. To the God who made
all things and controls all things. We
offer this prayer. Let the words of my
mouth and the meditation of my heart be
acceptable in your sight. Oh Lord, my
strength and my redeemer. In the name of
Christ.
Amen. Question for you. Were there ever
any controversial preachers in the
Bible? How about the Apostle
Paul? Everybody wasn't always thrilled
with everything he had to say, were
they? Uh, he upset people. According to
his own account that he wrote down, he
was beaten many times, flogged five
times, beaten with rods three times,
stoned once and left for dead,
shipwrecked three times, spent a night
and a day lost at sea, got bitten by a
to poisonous snake, and he ended up in a
Roman prison where he eventually died.
But in spite of all that, he kept on
preaching, didn't he? Well, I hope I
don't get bitten by a poisonous snake
when this is over. Any other
controversial preachers in the Bible?
How about
Jesus in his preaching and teaching? Did
everyone always agree with everything he
said? Uh, did Jesus ever say anything
that upset people?
Well, Jesus called the religious leaders
of his time
hypocrites, blind guides, fools, a den
of vipers, whitewashed tombs. Just read
the 23rd chapter of the book of Matthew
and you'll see why the leaders got so
upset with him, they eventually killed
him.
Uh well, if you've already probably
guessed from our reading, we're going to
be looking at a few things from Jesus
first publicly recorded sermon, the
sermon on the
mount. We know that Jesus preached other
sermons before the sermon on the mount.
And we're going to look at at a few
lessons from it. Matthew 4 tells us,
"Aha, Jesus went all around
Galilee, number one, teaching in the
synagogues, number two, preaching the
gospel of the kingdom, and third,
healing all kinds of sickness and all
kinds of disease among the
people." And great multitudes followed
him. Now, we don't know what he preached
in these sermons that he was preaching
as he went all around Galilee because
they weren't recorded. But Matthew
begins the fifth chapter of Matthew by
saying, "And seeing the multitudes,
great multitudes were following. And he
saw these multitudes. And seeing the
multitudes, he went up on a mountain,
and when he was seated, his disciples
came unto him. And he opened his mouth,
and he taught them, saying, "Blessed are
the poor in spirit, for theirs is the
kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that
mourn, for they shall be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall
inherit the earth." Can't you just see
all the people sitting there listening
to him, and they're nodding their heads
in agreement, and they're saying,
"That's good. Preach on. Tell us
more. Find your next
Listen. And so he
continues, "Blessed are the merciful.
Blessed are the pure in heart. Blessed
are the
peacemakers. Blessed are those who are
persecuted for righteousness sake, for
theirs is the kingdom of heaven." And
the multitude liked what they were
hearing. They were saying, "Amen. Amen."
And he went on and preached a little
further and he said, "You're the salt of
the
earth. You're the light of the
world." In my mind, I can just imagine
the multitudes were all smiling and
hanging on to every word that Jesus was
speaking. One of them nudging his
neighbor, says, "I like what this guy's
saying. He talks like someone with
authority and not the same old same old
that we hear every week from the
scribes. But then Jesus gets a little
controversial. Remember, these are
Hebrew people that he's talking to
living under foreign
rule. They've grown up their whole life
studying at the
synagogues, studying the law of Moses.
They knew what the law
says. And Jesus continues and he says,
"You have heard that it was said of
those old, you shall not murder, and
whoever murders will be in danger of the
judgment. But I say to you that whoever
is angry with his brother without a
cause shall be in danger of the
judgment. And whoever says to his
brother, "Raqa," shall be in danger of
the council. But whoever says, "You
fool," shall be in danger of hell
fire. The crowd suddenly gets real
quiet. They're not too sure about this.
The law of Moses doesn't put this last
part on, and they've studied the law
their whole life. So, where'd that come
from? Jesus doesn't stop there. He goes
on and says, "You've heard it was said
to those of old, you shall not commit
adultery.
But I say to you that whoever looks at a
woman to lust after her has already
committed adultery with her in his
heart. Hang on there, preacher. You done
quit preaching and started meddling.
Now, I
mean, they're not sure about
this. The law doesn't say that. And
Jesus said, "But I said." Jesus goes on
to talk about divorce and taking oaths.
And he introduces something new into
the religion introduces attitudes, the
intent of the heart along with the law.
This is all new to the people, but they
just love hearing him speak. What he
says is not the same thing that they've
been
hearing. Jesus wanted them to
think. He wants us to
think. He wants to be in our minds, in
our
hearts. Often in Jesus
ministry, he would use the term, "You
have heard it
said," and he always countered this with
the statement, "But it is written," or,
"But I
say." Jesus knew the difference between
what we hear and what the scriptures
say.
The church
today needs to know more about what's
written in this
book than what we're hearing people tell
us. We need to know what's in this book.
And Jesus says, "Yeah, that's what you
need to know. You need to
think." That's why the Apostle Paul
wrote to Timothy and he said,
"Study to show yourself approved unto
God, a workman who does not need to be
ashamed, rightly dividing the word of
truth." Notice he doesn't say read it.
What does he say? Study it. The church
needs to study this book more than we
need to pay attention to what we're
being taught.
I can just imagine Jesus standing by the
sea of Galilee which near
Capernium and in fact there's a natural
amphitheater on the north side of the
sea of Galilee there still today on the
side of a mountain there and that could
have been the place that he went because
there was an amphitheater where people
could be there and a great multitude was
fallen he's seated upon this mountain
the people are seated on grass below him
and he's teaching them. Now, picture
yourself in this crowd as Jesus
speaks as he's speaking. I can imagine
they're sitting there just eating up
every word that's coming out of his
mouth. In fact, one man nudges neighbor
says he teaches like somebody who's got
authority, not like the scribes.
They're really amazed at things he's
preaching and all of a sudden he drops a
bombshell. I can just imagine the crowd
really listening now to hear what he's
going to say
next. Open your Bibles or devices if you
got it with to
Matthew 5 verse
41. That's what we're going to talk
about tonight.
Matthew 5:41. A very short verse. We can
probably all memorize that in less than
20
seconds. The King James version says,
"And whosoever shall compel thee to go a
mile, go with him
twain." That's not Mark Twain. Go with
him twain.
The New King James, little planer, says,
"And whoever compels you to go one mile,
go with him
two." Go with him two
miles. Heard a story one time about a
Bible school teacher had her elementary
school class memorize Matthew chapter 5,
verse 41 from the King James. and she
says, "Next Sunday in class, I'm going
to have everyone stand up one at a time
in front of the class and recite Matthew
5:41 to the rest of the class." Well,
there's one student in the class, little
Johnny. Now, all you teachers, you've
had a little Johnny in your class,
right? That you always kind of wonder
what he is going to say when he gets up.
We've we've all seen Johnny. I was that
little Johnny growing up.
And all the kids the next Sunday
morning, they all get up one at a time
and they get up and they said,
"Whosoever shall compel thee to go a
mile, go with him
twain." And they all did that. And then
it comes little Johnny's turn. And he
stands up as big and tall as he can. And
he speaks very loudly and he says, "And
whosoever shall compel thee to go a
mile, go with him by train."
Uh, probably a lot of us think that
would be real nice if we could go that
second mile in a train, wouldn't it? But
that's not quite what it says. I like
the NIV translation a little better on
this one. I can understand this one. The
New International says, "If anyone
forces you to go one mile, go with them
two
miles. If anyone forces
you, go with them
too. Anyone. Who does that
include? It includes our friends, our
family, our
neighbors, your
boss, your
teachers, even our
enemies.
Anybody if anybody anyone forces you to
go a
mile, have you ever been forced to do
something that you really didn't want
to? We don't use the word compel very
much nowadays. So the NIV even says
compelled. He says if anybody forces you
to do something,
uh have you ever been forced to do
something that you really didn't want to
do? Probably all of us
have. How about when your boss comes to
you on Friday afternoon, it's almost
quitting time, and he says, "I need you
to stay late today and finish up that
project you've been working on before
you go
home." Oh, I've got plans. I really
don't want to,
but you do it, don't you? Because that's
how you get your paycheck. So, you're
going to do it. But we don't like it.
Kids, how about your new teacher? Says,
"Before you come back next Monday, I
want you to read the next two chapters
in this book we're studying. I want you
to write a 500word essay on it, and
we're going to have test when you get
back Monday." What? That's not
fair. I've got to go to the beach this
weekend with my friends. I got to spend
time conversing with them. You're not
fair. But you do it, don't you?
We don't like to be forced to do
anything.
Uh we like to do things on our terms.
How many of you think the second mile is
the hard
mile? I
don't. I think that should be the
easiest
mile. Why? That's my mile.
The first mile is the got to mile. I've
got to do this. The second mile is the
get to. I get to do this. It's my
decision. It's a lot
easier. I do it because I want to.
Nobody forced me. Anytime we get to do
something we want to do, it's more fun,
isn't
it? So, it's the easy mile. I guess if
we needed a train to go a mile, it would
be the first mile. The old got to mile.
I need a train to do that one because I
didn't want to do this. The second one's
my mile. I made that
choice. But before we go any further, I
want to look at the background, give you
a little background of the Matthew 5:41.
I've read that when the Roman government
conquered an area, a province, a city, a
town, anywhere, they would go to the
center of the most important city in
that town, and they would set up what's
called a Roman
yoke. That's a Roman yoke that's still
in England, still standing there. It's a
stone that says Caesar is Lord on it.
They would set that up there and as the
people passed that they would have to
kind of bow to the Roman yoke. It was in
the middle of each city there. Just a
reminder that the Romans are in charge.
Sometimes they would go to the chief
city gate of the city and they would put
a beam across the gate and they would
make the leaders of that city walk
through the gate and they'd have to bend
over when they went under that just as a
sign of the obedience and respect to the
Roman government and to its
laws. Now remember these were Hebrew
people who were under Roman rule. They
didn't like that, but they had to do
it. One of the laws of Rome was if a
Roman citizen was on an errand for the
government or if a Roman
soldier needed you to carry his packer
load or to guide you, you had to do
it. No choice. You did not have a
choice. You had to do it. Didn't make
any difference what you were doing. You
could be busy as a bee. You just had to
quit what you were doing and you had to
do whatever they told you to
do. You had to, you know, throw down
whatever you're doing and
go, one
mile. The Roman government wasn't
totally cruel. The law required them to
go one mile.
I read that men and boys would go down
the road a mile from their house each
way and they would drive a stake in the
ground and write their name on it. And
that was called their
milepost. We still use that term today,
don't we? On the interstates, we got
milepost out there. Every mile there's a
stick down there that tells you where
you are. Well, that's where it came
from. They would drive that mile post in
there. And if they had to do that, they
would go down the road one
mile,
1,760 yards,
2,580 ft, and they would stick that
stick in the ground and that's my mile
post. That's my got to go that
mile. Uh they would carry that burden as
far as that mile post and then they
would throw it down and go back home.
They hated this
rule. Only in cases of extreme emergency
could they be required to go further
than that one mile. They hated it. And
Jesus says, "If anyone forces you to go
one mile to your mile post, go with them
two. Go two miles.
The expression on their faces, I can
just imagine, suddenly changed in a
hurry of this multitude that had been
enjoying this speech from enjoyment to
amazement and for some to utter
disgust. One of them clenches his fist
so tight that just he's digging his
nails into his hand. You I can't stand.
Punches his neighbor and said, "Did you
hear that?
Does this man mean to tell us he
approves of the Roman government? What's
wrong with
him? I don't guess Jesus ever said
anything that shook up a crowd worse
than
this. And
yet Jesus chose this obnoxious Roman
rule to teach one of the greatest
principles of a Christian's
life, second mile service.
Not many days after the sermon, after
they heard
this, there were a couple of people who
had heard
this. And the first
man was named Simon. Let me tell you the
story of
Simon. Simon's out working in his field
one day. It's a hot, hot, humid day.
He's
tired. About this time, a big old Roman
soldier comes walking down the road sees
him over there, says, "Hey, you come
here and carry my
load." Simon knew he had to do it. No
choice. So he throws down his hole and
he broke it. He cemented breaks it,
stomps out to the road, cusses out this
soldier, and picks up his
pack. As they head down the
road, he says, "I hate you Romans. I
wish you would all die. Just go home and
leave us
alone." They walk on in silence for a
while and they finally get to Simon's
milepost. He throws down that
pack. He mutters a few more choice words
and he stomps back to the field, picks
up his broken hoe, and he heads home.
When he gets to his house, the dog comes
out to meet him. He kicks that dog
halfway to kingdom come. His kids see
him. They know what kind of mood daddy's
in. They
hide. His wife sees him. She stays in
the house. He yells at wife. He says,
"Woman, when's supper? I'm
hungry." Just a bad day for everybody at
Simon's house. His reaction to that
soldier just ruined his
day. But as Paul Harvey
says, and now the rest of the story, the
story of
Benjamin. Another day, Benjamin's out
working in his
field. This same Roman soldier comes
walking down the road, sees Benjamin.
Hey, you come here and carry my
pack. Benjamin looks over and says,
"Sure, be glad
to
what?" He carefully leans his hoe
against the
tree. He walks out there. He picks up
the pack and he says, "Hello, my name's
Benjamin. What's your
name?" Now, this soldier doesn't know
how to handle this. He said, "Something
wrong with this guy. Just doesn't know
how to handle it." Excuse me.
They head down the road and he says,
"Uh, my name's Marcus." So they head
down the road together and Benjamin
says, "Hot day, isn't it? Would you like
a drink of water from my flask? This is
out of my wells. Best well around. Good
water. Would you like some?" "No, no,
thank you. I don't I'm not thirsty right
now." Uh go a little further down the
road and Benjamin says, "You see that
flower growing over there? That's the
rose of
Sharon." Pretty, isn't it? I'm told it
only grows in this part of the country.
Do they have flowers where you're
from?
Uh Marcus says, "Uh,
well, yeah, it is nice. Believe I will
have a drink of that water." So they
walk on down the road together
and excuse me, Benjamin says, "Are you
from Rome?" I've never been anywhere
myself. Just right around here. I don't
know anything about any other country.
Marcus says, "No, I'm not from Rome. I'm
from a little town north of Rome called
Florence." Well, would you tell me about
it? Is it as pretty as this country?
I've never been anywhere.
Now, anybody who's spent much time away
from
home, especially if they've been away
home for a long
time, and especially soldiers who are
away from home, you that have been
soldiers, like nothing better than to
talk about
home. Just ask me about Tennessee if you
want me to spend some time with me. I'll
tell you about home.
So Marcus starts telling Benjamin all
about Italy, about Rome and the
Colosseum, the Roman Forum, all the
monuments there and his home city of
Florence and Tuskanyany and Marcato del
Porcelino and he tells him all about it.
Meanwhile, they walk right past
Benjamin's milepost and just keep on
walking. After a while, Marcus says,
"Didn't we pass your mile post back
there? Uh, I've taken enough of your
time. You need to get on home." Venuan
says, "No, no, I'm enjoying it. I got a
break from being out in the sun working,
and I've enjoyed talking to you." So
Marcus says, 'Well, maybe after this is
all over, you and your family can come
to Italy and visit with me and my
family, and I'll show you all around,
tell you, show you these things we've
been talking about. Well, I'd enjoy
that. I really would. So, they exchange
email addresses and cell phone numbers
so they can get in touch with each
other. This is a story that I made up,
so you know, they had cell phones back
then.
They exchange it so they can get in
touch with each
other. And Benjamin heads on back home.
Marcus picks up his pack, heads on up
the road, and he's
whistling. You know, there's some nice
people in this
country. So Benjamin gets to house and
the little dog comes out to meet him and
he bends out. He plays with that dog,
scratches him on the belly a while. And
the kids see him coming. So they run
out. He plays with him, swings him
around. His wife's watching from the
door. So, as he stops at the well and
he's cleaning up, she says, "I know what
you did
today." He says, "How could you know
what I did?" She said, "You went the
second mile, didn't
you?" Yeah. And I can't wait to tell you
about
Marcus. It makes a difference in our
lives.
But you might ask, you know, what's the
application to me today? What's the
difference between these two men? The
big difference between the two is
attitude. Simon's attitude ain't no way.
Law says this, that's all I'm going to
do. Benjamin says, I'll give it a try.
See how it works.
But you might ask, say, you
know, what's that got to do with me? Let
me put it to you in Tennessee
vernacular. Always do a little more than
anybody's got a right to expect of you.
Just do a little more than what they've
got a right to expect of you. You'll be
surprised what it gets you.
The law says one
mile. Jesus says do more than
that. He doesn't limit it to just two
miles,
though. This right here is the greatest
success manual in the world.
If you want to know how to be
successful, you could read Zigg
Ziggler's See You at the Top. It's got
all sorts of suggestion. You can read
Warren Buffett's rules for
success. Okay? You can read Steven
Covey's Seven Habits for Highly
Successful
People, but this is the best one. Every
bit of it is in this book. Study to show
yourself approved.
Three
observations from Matthew 5:41. We've
all memorized that verse. Now, if
anybody ever asked you what Matthew
5:41, you know what it says because
little Johnny taught it to
you. Lesson number one, going the second
mile brings a blessing to the person
being
served to Marcus.
It might even make a tough old soldier
smile and
whistle. You might even make a new
friend out there. It brings a blessing
to them. That's what Paul had in mind
when he wrote in Romans. If your enemy
is hungry, feed him. If he's thirsty,
give him a drink.
It's a blessing to the person being
served. Second lesson from
this going the second mile brings a
blessing to you, to
me. It's good for your soul. It's good
for your body to do it. From Rexa's
lesson he had several weeks ago on
stewardship is giving. Number four. See,
I even took a picture of it. That's your
slide. This is what Second Mile Service
can do for you. Time magazine. There's a
positive association between helping
others and life expectancy. Do you want
to live
longer? Helping others reduces
stress. Studies have shown that older
people, that's me, older people who are
generous tend to have better health.
It's good for you to do things for the
HeartMath Institute. When you are
altruistic, lending a helping hand, your
oxytocin level goes up, which helps
relieve your
stress. When you're lending a helping
hand to people, descent says generous
people were almost three times as likely
to report being happy every day than
less generous people.
So it's good for
you. Gallup poll says people who donate
charity in the past month reported
greater satisfaction with
life. Even in rich and poor countries.
You want to be happy, you want to be
healthy, be
generous. Go the second mile. And the
third
thing, going the second mile pleases
God.
Matthew 5:16 says, "Let your light so
shine before men that they may see your
good works and glorify your father in
heaven." It pleases God when you're
doing things. Let your light shine.
Remember he told them earlier, we said,
"You are the light of the world. Let it
shine. Do
things." God went the second mile for
us, didn't he? He would never ask us to
do anything that he hasn't done
himself. John 3:16, which we all know.
God so loved the world that he gave his
only begotten son that whoever believes
in his should not perish but have
everlasting life. He would not ask us to
do more than he had done. He did more
than we can ever do. And if that's not
going the second mile, I don't know what
it is. He went the second mile. He wants
us to do
too. In the early 1900s or mid 1900s,
there was a boy born in a
small shack near Memphis, Tennessee. His
name was Herman Kaine. There's Herman.
Uh his
father had a little education but he was
a hardworking honest man and he worked
as a janitor and a
barber. Herman had a brother and he
always says that he learned his work
ethic from his dad. Work hard, be
honest. His mother worked as a cleaning
lady and she'd been to school and every
night after dinner, she would read to
the family from one of the few books
that they owned, the family
Bible. And they soaked it up. She read
to them every night after supper. Herman
said later in life that his mother
taught him and his brother the greatest
thing he ever learned. Success is not a
function of what you start out with
materially. It's what you start out with
spiritually. That's what's going to make
you
successful. Well, Herman's father wanted
them to have a better life. So, he moved
the whole family to Atlanta, Georgia.
And he was lucky enough he got a job as
chauffeur
for the president of Coca-Cola Company
in Atlanta. Well, Herman was really
smart. This is Herman. And he graduated
from high school with honors. Got a
scholarship to Morehouse College and he
graduated with degree in math. Got
another scholarship. Went to Purdue and
got a graduate degree in computer
science. After graduation, he went to
work for Coca-Cola Company because the
president of Coca-Cola liked his
chauffeur. Hardworking, honest man. So,
I'll hire his son. So he worked for
Coca-Cola. He worked his way up in the
company because he had that work ethic
he learned from his father. And
eventually he was appointed director of
business analysis for the restaurant and
foods group. He managed 400 Burger King
restaurants. Now this is from a shack
right outside Memphis. He's managing 400
Burger King. He is the director of
business analysis. In 1986, he started
his own business. He and some others. He
became president and CEO of Godfather's
Pizza. I don't think there's any
Godfathers around us. They make good
pizza. They really did. And you know
what the corporate motto for Godfather's
Pizza always
was? And then
some. That's Godfather's Pizza. If the
other pizza chains large pizza was 14
inches, Godfather is 16 inches for the
