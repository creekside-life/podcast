I want to talk to you today about
missing Thanksgiving you know not
everybody is thankful I know we all
should be but not everyone is thankful
uh fella said my grandfather tried to
warn everyone that the Titanic was going
to sink but they were not thankful and
besides not believing him they made him
get out of the
theater so
please excuse my name calling but if you
really hate Thanksgiving you must be a
turkey
the things that people say when they're
not thankful is they make
justification for why they are not
thankful I was thinking about these nine
men who've been cured of a disease that
would kill you
and some of you sitting here have been
cured from a disease that would kill you
in fact probably in our
society maybe 30
40% have had such events in their lives
been
surgeries
medicines and we are alive today many of
us sitting here are alive today that
shouldn't been 100 years ago we wouldn't
be 200 years ago definitely wouldn't be
alive today births some of you came
through births that no one would have
got
you but yet sometimes we become unth
thankful for things and these men may
have tried to figure out a way to not be
thankful I don't know what went through
their mind but maybe one of them said
I'll wait to see if the Cure is real
maybe one of the others said you know
I'll wait to see if it really lasts
maybe it'll come back or maybe the other
one said I'll thank him later when I
really have the time I don't really have
the time right now maybe one said I I
don't think I'll ever really had the
serious disease
anyway maybe one thought well I think I
would have gotten well on my own if it
just given me
time maybe somebody thought to
themselves I probably owe it all to my
faith my goodness and my religious
leaders I was just a good person that's
why I got well or maybe oh well the Lord
didn't really do anything in
anyway or maybe one thought any preacher
could have probably done that he's
nothing different than them or maybe one
said you know I was really already much
improved before he touched
me we make a lot of excuses for not
being
grateful often once a man gets the help
he asks the church for if you're in
Ministry you know this very well and
many of the elders and deacons know this
but once he gets the help he has for
from the church he disappears and we
never see him again you know how often
that
happens
oh like 99% of the
time often we are ungrateful to our
parents young
people King Lear in his tragedy said how
sharper than a Serpent's tooth it is to
have a thankless child
I probably have not been nearly as
thankful as I should be for my own
mother and my own father often we are
ungrateful for our fellow men people do
things for us all the time and we fail
to thank them I remember a gentleman
who's close to passing away at this
point Dr Van druon and how he saved
Bethany's life and Deb's
life I couldn't repay him I did a weird
thing I went and got like 24
roses and took it to a
doctor but I've forgotten that since
then often we are ungrateful to
God many times even Christians will sit
down to eat food that they won't even
say grace
over Jesus was On the Border in our text
between what's known at the time as
Galilee in
Samaria these 10 lepers met him stood a
far off usually that was about 50 yards
that stand away at least according to
the scriptures that uh I've given you in
Leviticus and
numbers now while Jews had no dealings
with Samaritans and Samaritans had no
dealings with Jews and they couldn't
stand each
other it's interesting that there was a
Samaritan in this group isn't it don't
don't you think that's interesting
interesting did you know that Misfortune
can break down racial and National
barriers you see if you're both in hot
water it's amazing how you don't notice
the other
things leprosy made the sufferers forget
that they were Jews and
Samaritans but they all remembered that
they were in need of healing didn't
they but it's like in a flood in a flood
while animals will do this it's been
seen well we know it happens because if
you watch Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom
back when they created the the kba dam
and that filled up you probably remember
this happening wild animals will
congregate on Higher Ground peacefully a
lion will lay down with the lamb
literally if there's a flood and they're
escaping it it makes me think of a movie
I saw this week the wild robot and I
cried watching it with all that kids
y'all watch that it's a great movie it's
not real don't get upset there's no wild
R common needs draw all men together why
in the world do you think you and I are
sitting here together we would have
never been
friends but for the grace of God and the
need for a
savior you realize that right we didn't
never even known each other if we had
just been in the
world we're all on that island and the
flood waters are around us and we are
happy Samaritans with happy Jews amen
happy to be here I want to look at five
truths that will help you from this text
to avoid missing Thanksgiving this year
okay that's the simple lesson let's go
to it number one
here we go to avoid missing Thanksgiving
we must recognize the blessing look at
your text if you're not there I'd
encourage you to go Luke 17 verse 15
says and one of them when he saw that he
was healed you know leprosy affected the
skin you could see
it he saw
it it suddenly was gone
he saw
it you got to recognize the blessing my
friend you got to see it you know if
you're not looking for something you
don't find it have you notice that you
never find the thing you're not looking
for Psalm 103:2 says bless the Lord oh
my soul and forget not all his benefits
you need to name it you need to
recognize it and name it you need to be
praying for things and then pay
attention cuz if you don't pay attention
you'll just do what we did earlier all
that was just all that was just the
doctor oh that was just the medicine oh
that was just the treatment I got there
that God didn't do
that name it if you got a healing name
it God healed
me if you got abundance name it God
blessed me with more than I
needed if you got it if you were rescued
from something terrible name it if money
came to you out of the mail name
it name it say it out loud don't miss
Thanksgiving make an effort and recogniz
just recognize it just look around you
have you really looked at what you've
got what God has done recognize the
blessing that's the first truth we need
to learn one of them recognized number
two to avoid missing Thanksgiving we
must return turn to the
blesser it says in verse 15 and one of
them when he saw that he was
healed
returned you got to go
back you got to go back you remember you
were on your knees when you ask him or
you were laying on your bed
crying you got to go back there you got
to go back or maybe you were in church
you got to go back
there and Isaiah 35 verse 10 and the
ransomed of the Lord shall return and
come to Zion with singing with
Everlasting Joy on their heads they
shall obtain joy and gladness and sorrow
and sign shall flee away
return be here come back here and say
thank you Lord what do you think we sing
for what do you think we pray for thank
you Lord amen maybe you can say it with
me thank you Lord I try it out thank you
Lord thank you Lord thank you Holy
Father amen thank you thank you thank
you thank
you one more time thank you Lord
amen every
time so don't miss Thanksgiving make an
effort to return to the blesser don't
forget who did
it number three to avoid missing
Thanksgiving we must Rejoice for the
blessing we we need to rejoice in it
listen to what this gentleman does now
that he is
healed and one of them when he saw that
he was healed
returned and he said Thank You Lord
no with a loud voice glorified God
praise the
Lord boy I wish I could get some of you
to open your mouth and
sing you know I'm not a good singer I'm
not somebody asked me the other day can
you sing good no no no I I've seen
preachers who can really sing good I'm
not one of them if you sit next to me
you'll find out no I'm not one of them I
I'm I wish I was if I was i' i' i' tell
you
something sounds better in the shower I
promise
you that's just because it echoes around
so much Psalm 33:1 rejoice in the Lord
oh you righteous for praise from the
upright is beautiful listen to me it
isn't about how it sounds praise from
the upright is
beautiful so open your mouth don't sit
there like a stump on a log you've been
saved you've been redeemed your soul has
been bought back from Satan you should
be in
hell and you sit there like well I'll
let them sing I don't sound good I don't
think it's very masculine to
sing get over
yourself well all I can do is just croak
Get Over Yourself Praise the Lord amen
with a loud voice ready Raise Your Voice
what could we do in this room listen to
how I'm echoing around here if everybody
was as loud as I am right now what do
you think singing would sound like in
this
place quit sitting at the back move
forward sing loud do
something you've been saved you've been
redeemed sing out to the Lord amen amen
amen
walls walls are faithful don't miss
Thanksgiving
make an effort and rejoice for the
blessing number
next to avoid missing Thanksgiving we
must reverence the
blesser look at what he
says and one of them when he
saw that he was healed returned with a
loud voice glorified God and listen to
this fell down on his
face not on his knees
he fell down on his
face at his feet giving him
thanks listen to me I'm G to say
something you you listen to this because
this is
big
humility is the only way a man can
worship there is no pride In Worship
you have to
recognize how big God is and how little
you
are if you were missing and had never
been here none of us would be asking
about
you you think the world would have
wailed because you weren't here
God chose you to be here you owe
everything to him not some
stuff everything to him you haven't
earned
anything it's all been a gift you can
work as hard and be as smart where did
you get the smart where did you get the
health to work where did you get
anything to do anything with what you
doing it with you think you got that on
your own how
foolish it's all a
gift from a good
God and when it's bad it's still a
gift we'll talk about that another
time Isaiah
45:23 I have sworn by myself this is God
talking to himself I have sworn by
myself the word has gone out of my mouth
in righteousness and shall not return
that to me every knee shall bow and
every tongue shall take a oath that's
you you are going to Bow you want to
learn
now amen you are going to be humble you
ought to learn
now I assure you on that day you'll put
your face on the ground and be
begging yeah
Lord don't remember what happened last
week you
know don't miss Thanksgiving make an INF
and reference the blesser he is the
almighty God the almighty
God number
five to avoid missing Thanksgiving we
must remember the Blessed now we need to
look at oursel just a minute look at
what happens in this text I'll read it
all now verse 15 and one of them when he
had saw that he was healed returned with
a loud voice glorified God fell on his
face at his feet giving him thanks he
was a Samaritan well we
know if we're Jews we know they're
scum so Jesus answered and said were
there not 10 cleansed but where are the
nine were there not any found who
returned to give glory to God except
this Foreigner all those Jews where'd
they go it's just this Foreigner we
don't even like
him he said to them him arise and go
your way your faith has made you
well we need to learn those that we may
not approve
of God may
receive let me tell you something it
won't be a member of the Church of
Christ on the throne it is the lord of
the church on the
throne he gets to
call the call you're not the
Umpire he decides everything and he gets
to decide who He
blesses and we are all
foreigners listen to a no one of you I
probably a one there might be excuse me
if you are I don't mean anything but if
you're Jewish you're an odd person out
in this room the rest of us are from
Gentile descent we're all foreigners
we're all the scum they would have saw
us as all of our descendants come from
the other side of the
track you're not
unique except that you're unique to be
just like the rest of us we're all from
the other side of the
track we don't deserve to be here
I don't descend from
Abraham now by the way God raised
children up from rocks from Abraham but
list just understand what has been done
for us we need to remember who the
Blessed really is have you thought about
you're just a
leper you're just a
leper Psalm 107:2 let the redeemed of
the Lord say so I've been redeemed I was
not where I ought to be I've been
redeemed I was on the other side I've
been redeemed amen I've been redeemed I
wasn't what I should be man I used to
make fun of you guys we sat in our house
and laugh at people went to
church Israelites were there too don't
you remember hey Jews don't you remember
uh you were redeemed you used to be
slaves in Egypt you remember
Jews you remember that that you were
redeemed you used to be strangers you
know that thing you think that the this
Samaritan is that Foreigner that's what
you were in Egypt you remember that you
remember that you ever remember being
treated the way you're treating this
other person right remember that you
were just a bunch of Sinners you didn't
even serve the Lord down in Egypt you
not remember any of that you see that
could be said about you and me couldn't
it everything I just said about the Jews
can be said about you can be said about
me and about me being a leper
we are
those who've been
blessed remember what you are blessed
folks and where you came
from God is good amen all the time and
all the time God is
good that's a lesson recognize the
blessing see
it
return to the blessing
Rejoice for the blessing and
reverence the
blesser and
remember the Blessed don't miss
Thanksgiving this year make an effort
now I need to you know I'm going to tell
you something and then I'm going to let
me tell you it's not going to sound
right all right so I don't like to talk
about myself I mean I've been encouraged
people that want me to tell stories from
my life and stuff like that I don't like
to do that and I'll tell you why don't
do it just so that when I do it here
just a minute you understand I don't
like to do it because I don't think the
emphasis should ever be on a preacher I
think the emphasis should always be on
the Lord Jesus that's just the way I
feel on the father I don't like telling
stories but let me tell you something
about myself and you'll understand what
I'm telling this right
now I've been mocked from the
time I at least in the eth
grade we thinking and I had to say it I
didn't want to that I was going to be a
preacher I didn't want to tell everybody
that but I already knew from the time I
was eight was going to be a preacher I
don't understand you folks that don't
know what you're going to be I've never
had that
experience I've always
known cuz once we made the
change and I'll tell you why
now a whole class laughed at me they
really enjoyed that they thought that
was hilarious that I would be a preacher
close friend of mine mocked me we had
debates back in the day he was a
Methodist I'm obviously Church of Christ
and we argued about things and he he
said ugly things to me and I said some
ugly things to him I
think he just retired a preacher in the
Church of
Christ I know who you are barry if
you're
listening good
friend I had professors in college
teachers
preachers
missionaries elders and deacons in the
last 50 odd
years mock
me say bad
things I've had family members not
foreigners family tell me I should be
doing something
else but they don't know
what I
know see I
remember why I'm
here it's got nothing to do with
you I still remember how the gospel
changed my
family and I know I'm a poor
preacher not going to argue that so many
so much better I agree with you never be
in that list
whatever that list is that's not who I
am but I remember that frightening
night praying the first prayer that I
ever remember
praying I was somewhere between 7 and
8 I remember what I prayed this was the
prayer I prayed it over and over and
over unless you were there there you
could not
know please
God just don't let it be like this
anymore and you know
what the Lord answered
that and I will never forget
that oh I could talk to you about
thousands of other prayers he's answered
but that's why I'm here I haven't forgot
it made a commitment to him because of
it give thanks to the Lord
amen in his
autobiography breaking barriers Carl
Rowan tells about a teacher who greatly
influenced his
life he called her Miss Thompson let me
read this to you Miss Thompson reached
into her desk
drawer and pulled out a piece of paper
containing a quote attributed to Chicago
AR architect Daniel
Burham I listened intently as she read
it quote no make no little
plans they have no magic disturb men's
blood and probably themselves will not
be realized make big plans
aim high in Hope and work remember that
our sons and grandsons are going to do
things that would stagger
us he went on to say more than 30 years
later I gave a speech in which I said
that Francis Thompson that's the name of
the Miss tip Thompson Francis Thompson
had given me a desperately needed belief
in myself a newspaper printed the story
of his speech and someone mailed the
clipping to my beloved teacher Miss
Thompson Miss Thompson then wrote him
here's what Miss Thompson who 30 years
before had encouraged one young man one
day this is what she wrote it you have
no idea what that newspaper story meant
to me for years I have endured my
brother's argument that I had wasted my
life that I should have married and had
a family
then I read that you gave me credit for
helping to launch a marvelous career I
put the clipping in front of my brother
after he read it I said you see I didn't
really waste my life did
I don't just be grateful to
others and keep it a secret to
yourself tell them and tell others what
they've done for you
you don't just be grateful to the Lord
and keep it a
secret tell him and tell others thank
you Lord I remember what you
did this Thanksgiving don't miss your
chance you got a chance Thursday's
coming up got a great chance I'm not the
only one with story you see what I
really know and one of the reasons I
don't like to tell my story is I know
you have as good or better
story every one
of don't miss telling
it especially at a time like
this your family could use hearing
it tell it thank the Lord
