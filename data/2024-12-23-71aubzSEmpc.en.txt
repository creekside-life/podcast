you know not everyone knows what they
think they know I know probably this has
happened to you you thought you knew
something and then found out you didn't
I heard of a man who was late to work
one day and he was listening to the
radio you know to get a little pumped up
for work and he's listening to what he
thought was a wise man on the radio
station and the guy said the way to
achieve inner peace and feel good about
yourself is to finish all the things
you've
started so the radio
listener talking to his boss later said
you know so I looked around the house to
see all the things that I had started
and hadn't finished and before leaving
the house this morning I decided to
finish off all the things i' started but
not finished so I finished off a bottle
of wine then I finished off a bottle of
whiskey then I finished off some Prozac
and then I finished off some valume and
then I finished off a cheesecake and
then I finished off a box of chocolates
you know that man was right you have no
idea how good I feel right
now not everybody really knows what
they're they think they know do they I
heard about this lady there's a people
noticed that it was out front of a
grocery
store there's a lady parked there
and she had been parked there a long
time she just sitting really still
actually she sitting like
this and the man approached her saw her
sitting there windows rolled
up and he said uh ma'am are you okay and
he tapped on the window ma'am are you
okay and she sitting there and she said
no well can I
help yes
well well can you open the
window
no can you open the door
no well well do you need help you need
me to call 911
yes do you do you me to break out your
window yes she's still just as still as
she could be sitting like that so he
went and Found A Tire Tool crowd begins
to form people sit all around the car
and he breaks out a window
and then 911 the guys get there all the
Mt and so when they're getting there he
says what's happened to you and she says
I've been shot in the back of my
head and I am holding my brains in my
head right
now and when the EMTs got there they
found that her car gotten overheated
with their groceries and a can of
biscuits had popped open and it
splattered all over the back of of her
head and she thought the sound of the
gunfire and she was holding her brains
in her head you know sometimes we don't
know what we think we know do we uh and
maybe that's a good thing that we don't
always know what we think we know
somebody said about that some folks have
biscuits for brains I'm not sure if
that's appropriate but I do think I do
think sometimes we think we know stuff
that we don't know not everyone knows
what they think they know about
God in Romans 15 and verse 33 makes it
clear and and then again in Romans 16:20
then again in 2 Corinthians 13:1 then
again in Hebrews 13:20 just in case you
missed it it was repeated four times
saying he's the God of Peace he's the
God of Peace he's the God of Peace as
the father of us all God is our King and
therefore he's the God of Peace and he
is the king of Peace 1 Corinthians 7:1
15 says God has called us to peace
peace in 1 Corinthians 14:33 it says God
is not the author of confusion but of
Peace so he's the God of Peace he is the
king of Peace but you know not everyone
knows that not everyone knows what they
think they know about Jesus the prince
our passage over and over again has
repeated we know it wonderful counselor
Mighty God Everlasting father Prince PE
in fact we've heard that so much you
ought to be able to repeat repeat that
with me let me see if we can get that
gun done wonderful counselor Mighty God
Everlasting father Prince of Peace let's
try it one more time because I know some
were lagging there all right so you
ready okay uh what's the first
one yeah that's what I thought all right
wonderful counselor Mighty God
Everlasting father Prince of Peace and
he is the Prince of Peace in Acts 3 and
verse1 15 it's the Prince of Life is
what he's called the Prince of Life whom
God raised from the dead acts five
causing Prince and savior to give
repentance and forgiveness of sins to
the world so basically you have God the
father and this is the way it kind of
works if you think about it God the
father who's king of all right and then
what do you call the son of a king you
call him a prince right so he's the king
of peace and he's the God of Peace and
then of course Jesus being his son is
also God and therefore he's the God of
Peace but he's also the Prince of Peace
naturally as a Son of God not everyone
knows what they think they know about
peace you know it's the word in the
Jewish Realms it's shalom you probably
heard that Shalom that's the word for
peace and the word Shalom doesn't mean
exactly what our word for peace means it
has a lot of meanings it means
Hess it means
completeness it means
soundness it means you've got good
welfare you're in a wellbeing Place
Tranquility Prosperity is included
security is included in that peace it's
also included in the idea is to be
unblemished to be free of
defects to be
blessed to have equity and to have
loyalty in fact the word is used in such
a way that what it often means is to
repair what has been broken that you
have Shalom when what was broken is
repaired that's the reason we come to
church right we were
broken and we needed peace we needed
what was broken to be repaired in fact
that word means that so much and about
overcoming Strife that there's a point
in which the word can be used in a way
that says you have Shalom and if you
have Shalom the way you should as full
as you should have it then it leaks
Shalom leaks that's why they talk about
it so Shalom leaks out of us and leaks
on to other people and so if you have
peace you end up giving peace to others
in Luke 2 and verse1 14 it says glory to
God in the highest and on Earth peace
Good Will toward
men in M Matthew 10:34 it says do not
think that I came to bring peace on
Earth now wait a
second you said peace on Earth Good Will
toward me and then he turns around and
says uh don't think I came to bring
peace on Earth I did not come to bring
peace but a sword so what is the
situation often we don't understand what
we think we understand is't that true uh
I know it is for me fellow with biscuits
for brains but I want just look at
basically three ideas and I think
that'll that'll be the lesson for us
today and I actually think this is
something we really need to think and
focus on pretty good number one the Son
of
God the Son of God of Peace So it's the
son of the God of Peace as the prince of
priest brought us peace with
God mankind was not at peace with God
from the garden in Isaiah 26:12 it says
this Lord you will establish peace for
us for you not us we don't do this you
have also done all our Works in us so
even the things we do we don't do it we
don't get credit for that it's all of
God Isaiah 52:7 how beautiful upon the
mountains are the feet of him who brings
good news who proclaims peace who brings
Glad Tidings of good things who
proclaims salvation who says to Zion
your god reigns when god reigns over me
I have peace when I'm
forgiven and God rules my life that is
Shalom in Romans 14:1 17 the kingdom of
God is not eating and drinking although
we do a good job of that around here
which I like by the way but the kingdom
of God is not eating and drinking but
righteousness and peace and joy in the
holy spirit so the Prince of Peace has
brought us peace with
God in the gospel that's first little
lesson it's not that deep but it is
important to
get what does the excuse me I went too
far go back
one well I went too far that
away there we go there we go back one
more no
no y'all want to hear the whole thing or
just go backwards there we go there we
go all right the son of
God who's the God of Peace as the prince
of priest brought us peace with men
that's how we're able to sit here
today we wouldn't have been
friends have you ever thought about
that we'd never been friends if it
wasn't for the
Lord Isaiah 54:10 for the mountains
shall depart and the hills be removed
but my kindness shall not depart from
you nor shall my Covenant of peace be
removed says the Lord who has mercy on
you so we're in a covenant of peace with
each
other that sounds pretty good to
me that we have Shalom with each
other listen to Ephesians the way it
describes this Ephesians 2:14 for he
himself is our peace so Jesus literally
became the peace between you and
me we're at peace with each other
because of him for he himself is our
peace who's made both one now in this
case he's talking about Jew Gentile but
he's talking about all of mankind
becoming one in the kingdom and has made
both one and has broken down the middle
Wall of Separation everything that
separated us he resolved that having
abolished in his flesh the enmity the
things that divided us specifically with
the Jews that is the law of Commandments
contained in ordinances so as to create
in himself one new man from the
two lost saved become one thus making
peace and then in verse 16 it says that
he might reconcile them both to God in
one body through the cross that body
called The Church thereby putting to
death the enmity the thing that divided
us and he came and preached peace so
that you who were a far off that's
talking about us who were not Jews and
to those who were near that's talking
about the Jews for through him we both
have access by one Spirit to the father
so we've been United to be
United man is United by being united
with God so Colossians 1:20 puts it this
way by him to reconcile all things to
himself whether things on Earth are
things in heaven having made peace
through the blood of his cross so here's
the thing so we have peace with God and
that peace with God has allowed us to
have peace with each other so the Prince
of Peace has brought us peace with men
through the cross of Our Lord I don't
know if we're going to get this the
straight Direction but we'll go try that
again here we go there we go so the Son
of God of Peace the Son of God of Peace
as the Prince of Peace brought us
peace with
myself and I think this might be the one
we appreciate the most
if you got Shalom
within you're a rich man this
Christmas if you got Shalom listen to
Isaiah
26:3 you will keep him in perfect peace
whose mind is stayed on you because he
trusts in you there is nothing like the
peace that you have within with yourself
when you know you're forgiven you know
you're right with God
and you're blessed to know that you have
the peace that you really need most of
all Philippians 4:7 the peace of God
which surpasses all understanding will
guard your hearts and Minds through
Christ Jesus so I need peace with God I
need peace with you if I've got peace
with God and I got peace with you that
hasn't resolved necessarily until I
recognize that I've got those things and
when I know I've got peace with God and
peace with you I can have peace within
if you're all jumbled up inside this
morning something's wrong with this and
this Philippians 4 the peace of God
surpasses all understanding you can't
explain it Colossians chap 3: 15 and 16
and let the peace of God rule in your
heart you have to allow it to rule in
your heart to which also you were called
in one body and be thankful and let the
word of of Christ dwell in you richly in
all wisdom so let God spill over on you
through his word and let his peace rule
in your heart so the Prince of Peace has
brought us peace with self he did that
through the grace that he provides we're
able to know we're saved because of
Grace because if you analyze what we've
done we that's no reason to think like
that right I mean just this last week
you've done wrong right so no reason to
have peace within except you have the
grace of God you have the cross of God
that's made us peace with man and you've
got the gospel that's given us peace
with God so that's the lesson simple
little
lesson peace with God through the gospel
peace with men through the cross and
peace with myself through the grace of
God peace on Earth Good Will toward man
it's what we talk about every
Christmas but do we really have it l
Senda Norman writes a story I thought
was really good I want to give this to
you uh she's writing about Christmas
shopping yeah lovely stuff ain't it
let's all go to the mall this afternoon
right don't you just love it Christmas
shopping she talking about being at the
mall she said people had while she's
shopping right at Christmas she said
people were pushing they were elbowing
they were cutting in front of her all
day and then during a 10minute extra 10%
off special one woman grabbed a lace
tablecloth from her hand and then took
it and grabbed her grabbed it and said
mine and said pulled it out of her hand
and nearly pulled her down by 4:00 she
said my mood was
belligerent she met some friends at the
mall restaurant y'all know at the food
court and she flagged down a server and
barked I need hot tea now
now waitress snaap back I'm not your
server wait your
turn it's all Christmas right lender
responded lady I've been waiting my turn
all day bring me some
tea she just ignored her walked away in
a few minutes
another uh server came a friendly young
man she said and came to her table and
said I'm Rob your
waiter and after he took her order lenda
said she watched
Rob as he walked about he helped the
rude waitress with her
tray he greeted the other
customers and staff every time with a
smile and in the midst of all the
hurriedness of all the customers and the
chaos he had a ploted and unhurried
atmosphere all around him
he was calm and when he refilled
leenda's tea lenda noticed a silver
ring on his hand it was connected
letters that spelled out
Jesus she said from that
moment my attitude
changed this young man's example had
reminded me of the piece that Christ
came to bring so there for the rest of
the day that we kept
shopping I opened doors for
others I led everyone in front of me at
the checkout
line I wanted to bring an atmosphere of
Peace Shalom leaks
out if at this stressful time maybe
peace and perfect peace sounds good I I
want to read to you what Edward Burker
wrote back in 1875 we've seen this
occasionally but we don't sing all these
verses says peace perfect peace in this
Dark World of sin the blood of Jesus
Whispers peace
within peace perfect peace by thronging
duties pressed to do the will of
Jesus this this is
rest
peace perfect peace with Sara surging
round on Jesus bosom not but calm is
found peace perfect peace mid suffering
sharpest
throws the sympathy of Jesus Breeze
Repose peace perfect peace with loved
ones far away in Jes Jesus keeping we
are safe and so are they
peace perfect peace our future all
unknown Jesus we know and he is on the
throne peace perfect peace death
shadowing us and ours Jesus has
vanquished death and all its
powers it is enough
Earth's struggles soon shall cease and
Jesus calls us to heaven and perfect
peace do you have it I hope you do in
the midst of all the chaos
peace Nicholas Ridley back in
1555 was going to be burned at the Stak
the next day and he
was died of miserable horrible death for
his
faith his brother the night before
offered to stay with him to give him
peace give him calmness you can imagine
tomorrow you're going to be burned at
the Stak you might like somebody to sit
with you right that's what his brother
thought and he offered to stay with him
and he declined it he said I mean to go
to bed and sleep as quietly as I ever do
for I have
peace do you have peace like that I
don't think I do I wish I did I want
that don't you Jesus Christ is our
wonderful counselor he is our Mighty God
he's our Everlasting father but he's our
Prince of Peace we of all people need to
have peace with God the Father we of all
people need to have peace with men we of
all people need to have peace within
with oursel we of all people should
bring peace we should leak it we should
leak Shalom out people should feel at
peace with us amen why not have peace
with God and peace with men and peace
with self it isn't that really what you
want this Christmas isn't that really
the thing it's not the whizbangs or the
Whatchamacallit it is the peace that
passes all understanding and you get it
through the gospel of the kingdom of God
you get it through the cross of our our
Lord Jesus Christ and you get it through
the guarding power of the grace of God
do you have it if you don't anything we
can do to help won't you come while we
stand and while we say
