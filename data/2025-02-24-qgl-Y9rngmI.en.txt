this morning's scripture is very
short uh VAR Su synct it um seems all
too simple in a way but it has
far-reaching
consequences uh upon our spiritual walk
it's something that's really really
necessary and you notice this this uh
scripture Rejoice always pray without
ceasing in everything give thanks for
this is God's will for you in Christ
Jesus that's a command and
well I don't know about you with things
like that you know it sort of goes on a
list of stuff that we're supposed to
do and it's hard to get all of the stuff
on the list
accomplished and it you know we'll get
some of it and then we have other things
to do and um it's like a juggling act
but I think there's something about this
and something about thankfulness that we
need to know that will help
us understand the importance of what's
going on here part of it the diff
difference between giving thanks and
being
thankful there is a difference um for
example when I was a young boy oh
between the age of five and 10 I don't
remember a specific time but I know what
happened um Christmas Day the morning
was over I opened up all of my all of my
presentence and I was really happy and
it was great and during the day what
usually happens is later on more
relatives come to have dinner and so
when they have come to having dinner
there're more presents right and you're
a kid and what do you want presents and
the presents that you want are toys
right you know car truck a blocks or
something a game and and I was no
different I suspect we all were that way
um well
well my auntie comes and here's this
beautiful package with a bow on it and
it's for me and she gives it to me and I
rip the paper off and I open the
box and it's
clothing and and all of that excitement
goes dripping out on the floor and it's
gone and and my mom comes by and she
does little verbal arm twisting right
and say thank you to
auntie thank you Auntie for the clothing
uh Fruit of the Loom is my favorite
and and you know I gave
thanks but you know there wasn't that
much thankfulness there wasn't that much
joy now if that were 15 years later when
I was paying for my own clothing that
would be a different thing oh that's
that's a good gift but one you know one
you're five or
six doesn't work out well I think that's
the key to how this
passage uh infiltrates the rest of our
Christian lives it isn't just the saying
of thanks it's our response to the gift
that we've received our understanding of
how important what we received is how
much it was worth and how much it's
useful to us
that's the big
difference what we
received was eternal
life what we received from God was Jesus
death on the cross and we just
celebrated it
here um it's a gift that could match no
other gift that anybody could ever give
to us in the entire
universe it's the most important gift
that mankind ever receive but it's the
most important gift that we could ever
receive and my thankfulness and my
rejoicing depends upon my valuing
Christ's gift the way it was
intended that's that's really the key to
this whole thing um it's an outpouring
of our gratitude to what Jesus did uh
let's look at uh for a minute let's look
at um Mark
7 and Mark Jack I won't I won't go
through the whole passage I'll
paraphrase some of it and get to the
heart of it
um my particular interest in Mark and
I'm sorry yeah Mark 7 I I got Luke
remember and wait a minute no I'm sorry
this is Luke 7 I have a typo this is
Luke chapter 7 excuse me you can change
your paper
uh the notorious woman is in Luke
chapter 7 starting at verse
36 um what happened there was a woman
who is notorious a small
town you know who you know there's a
notorious woman a woman whose life is
not in accordance with God's will she
has a bad reputation she must have heard
Jesus preaching before Jesus was having
dinner at a Pharisees house and it was
like an open dinner an open Forum kind
of thing the Pharisee was going to do an
exchange of ideas and challenges to
Jesus and everybody would gather around
while they were dining together and uh
they were all sitting around this table
and they were laying down they weren't
just sitting down they were reclining at
table and the feet were sticking outward
and this woman must have heard Jesus
preaching and she must have responded to
Jesus preaching and heard the mess
message of forgiveness and a new life
and eternal life and it had touched her
so
deeply that she came to this
dinner and she went down and she started
wiping jesus' feet with her hair
cleaning her cleaning his feet with her
tears and pouring ointment uh and
perfume on his
feet because she was so grateful at what
she heard the gift that Jesus was
offering
Ing and there was the Pharisee who was
evaluating Jesus thinking well if this
guy were a prophet how could he possibly
let that that kind of a woman touch
him and so he was thinking this and
Jesus uh started to tell a parable and
this is in verse 40 Luke chapter 7 Jesus
answered him Simon I have something to
say to you and he replied say it teacher
a money lender had two debtors one owed
500 Diner and another
50 when they were unable to repay he
graciously forgave them both so which of
them will love him
more Simon answered and said I suppose
the one whom he forgave more and he said
to him you have judged
correctly turning toward the woman he
said to Simon do you see this woman
I entered your house and you gave me no
water for my feet but she has wet my
feet with her tears and wiped them with
her hair you gave me no kiss but she
since the time I came in had not ceased
to kiss my
feet you did not anoint my head with oil
but she anointed my feet with
perfume for this reason I say to you her
sins which are many have been forgiven
for she loved much but he who is
Forgiven forgiven loves
little and he said to her your sins have
been
forgiven he who has been forgiven much
loves
much and that's where the
joy that's where the rejoicing comes in
that's where the thanks the thankfulness
comes in because we have been forgiven
much whether we re
we understand it properly or not
but this is the key when we were first
when we were first baptized we know our
sins were washed away we responded to
Jesus death burial and resurrection and
his death was counted as ours and we
began a new life a new eternal
life with eternal
value and if that isn't a cause for
thankfulness I don't know what
is and
typically especially as as we realize
this if we realize it wholeheartedly at
the first we're rejoicing and just like
the Ethiopian unic he went away
rejoicing like so many other people in
the New Testament uh conversion stories
we we walk away
rejoicing and it's right and proper and
we don't even have to be told to Rejoice
we don't have to be told to be thankful
because we are you know it's like a
little kid you know you get that toy you
wanted and it's thank you Auntie thank
you Auntie you're the best auntie in the
whole world I got to show you know I got
to show my friend Tommy um it's that way
you
appreciate that Eternal
gift the problem comes
in when we become forgetful the problem
comes in when we don't continue to be
thankful um I in in our paper
here um we're talking about the idea of
continual thankfulness we're just like
the Israelites who were just rescued
from
slavery we might read the Old Testament
we might read about U The Exodus and how
the uh Israelites were slaves and they
were ground
down uh they were ground down by their
slavery and they were calling out to the
Lord and God sent them Moses and God
produced all of these miracles to get
them delivered and they were delivered
they went through the Red Sea on dry
ground and the pharaoh's armies were
drowned and they were
free they they were lost they were
oppressed they were enslaved and they
were set
free and then they rejoiced Moses wrote
a song and I'm sure they learned that
song and sang along with him and and
Miriam his sister started leading the
women in in song and they danced and
they rejoiced and that's just like us
being freed from our sins and released
to become God's
people we
Rejoice but just like God's people what
happens the things of this world the
pressures of this world the worries of
this world the things of everyday life
start to pick at us
right and if we don't remember where we
came from and if we don't
remember the the power that's behind us
and the one who's holding our hands as
we go through all of this stuff what
starts to
happen we start
complaining we're thirsty we're thirsty
we're thirsty why did we come out here
in the first
place uh I'm sick of this man it doesn't
taste that
good I want the I want the onion and the
garlic and the and the
fish aren't we don't we get that way I
mean we forget you see we forget what
what prompted our thankfulness in the
first place we forget the the gift that
we have been given and that we still
have and because of that we start to
stumble and and flop around and we we go
backwards spirit
and so when we're told to um when we're
told to Rejoice
always to pray always and be thankful in
all things he means it and it's not just
because God is
um uh who has a u i don't know a I guess
a fragile ego that we've got to pet him
you know and and sort of uh you know
boost him up all of the time he God
doesn't have a power you know a fragile
ego he knows who he is we need to know
who he is it's for our benefit for our
benefit to know that God is God it's for
our benefit to know that God is
praiseworthy it is for our benefit to
know the extent to
which he he he came to to give us
eternal
life so praising God thanking God all of
that is for our
benefit it boosts us up um let's look at
at first at second Peter chapter
1 we we go go into detail on this in our
in the um in our uh New Beginnings class
but it's an important passage and
there's a part of it that I'd like to
look at and especially in second Peter
chapter
1 the Apostle Paul was talking to
Christian Paul the Apostle Peter is
talking to
Christians he's reminding them of all of
the spiritual blessings that God gave
them in Christ eternal life um escaping
the corruption of the
world um and then on the basis of our
forgiveness on the basis of the
blessings that God gave us uh and our
relationship to God he's saying okay
because you have all of these things be
diligent to add to your
faith add to your faith moral Excellence
add to your faith knowledge add to your
knowledge self-control add to your
self-control perseverance add to your
perseverance godliness add to your
godliness brotherly kindness and add to
your brotherly kindness love and he
talks about these things and says look
if these things are yours and you're
growing in them you're going to make
it uh you're not going to fall down so
as not to get up
again this is part of our
survival and of course God is working
with us in this we don't do it all for
ourselves or by ourselves elves it's
through his strength he's the one who
gives us the ability uh but notice in
verse 9 of second Peter chapter 1 verse
9 it
says he who lacks these
qualities is blind or
shortsighted having forgiven having
forgotten his purification from his
former
sins if we're not growing in in our love
if we're not growing in our brotherly
kindness if we're not growing in our
perseverance uh if we're not growing in
our self-control maybe it's because
we've forgotten where we came from and
we forgotten what we have because it
says says that's the case right verse N9
right here if we lack the qualities
we're blind or shortsighted we've
forgotten we don't see it anymore all I
see is I've lost my job and I don't know
what to do and why did I become a
Christian in the first place I mean what
good is what good is following God
now especially if you lost your job just
after you became a Christian you know
you're and and the pressures are on and
you
forget that you have a god who's with
you isn't that what
happens uh you know we might laugh at
the uh we might laugh or mock the um uh
the Israelites who are who are going
toward the promised land when they get
all Feist about these things they argue
about who's going to be the
boss um they complain about their food
they they complain about just about
everything under the sun and they forget
where they're going they forget who's
leading them they forget that they've
been a chosen special people and that
they have a
hope and when we
forget what we're thankful
for it it happens to us and it says
right here we're like them I was like
them um when I when I'm challenged by
stuff there's always that
temptation to to just see things in a
Physical Realm and forget about my
eternal goals and forget about my
eternal Joy there's a joy that can't be
taken away from us even if we got a
toothache or even if we got an operation
coming up or even even if we have a
secondness a secondness that's going to
lead to our death we have a joy before
us that's not going to be taken
away and and we need to remember that
um I don't know maybe maybe you can
relate to this and maybe you can't
um we have we have all these U amusement
parks around here right and they all
have have um what do you call it uh
roller coasters and things like that I
don't know call they call them roller
coasters anymore they other things that
they do but they're artific artificial
means to try to scare you to death right
and some folks here really happy about
that and they want to get on and go yay
and and some like myself are not too
crazy about all of that there's a
certain level of artificial fear for me
that's fun and there's a certain level
that I'll go on it because my kids want
to go on it or my grandkids want to go
on it and I I don't want to I don't want
them to die alone you know and and so um
and so I get on and I know you know that
you're going up and you're going up and
I'm grabbing onto the bar you know and
making sure the seat belts tight and
making sure you know the kids are all
squared away
and and I'm looking forward to being it
over you know I'm not I'm not looking
forward to enjoying any of it I know
some of you uh you know I I I know some
of you in here by name who probably
would love this but I don't anyway and
so when I get sick or when you know I'm
really in pain or when um when I'm
challenged by uh by being uh out of work
or some other thing it's like that isn't
it life life is like a roller coaster
you see the fear coming up oh now what's
going to happen when I I get up to the
top of
that and I know the higher I've gone up
the faster I'm going to go
down and you you have to get through it
right we have an advantage we have a
father whose hand we can hold on
to and if we've been practicing
thankfulness we've been practicing
thankfulness in our lives we have
another key to get through
it we got it we got through it before
God was with us before I I've been
without a job before I've I've been
without money before and he came through
he can come through now I've been sick
before and I've come through that
before and we're
reminded of what we really have and not
only that there's this
certainty that when the ride is all
over we'll be at the Landing Dock and
we'll be unbuckling and going going
walking away in peace
and that's the way it is with us in
life even if even if the roller coaster
ride we're on right now is going to lead
to our
death we still
win just like Paul facing uh facing
persecution in Rome he's saying
look to live is
Christ and to die is gain if he lives he
has more things to do for God while he's
here he has service to perform
great and if he dies he's with Christ
and that's far better so heads you win
and Tails You
Win and the idea of continually giving
thanks keeps this in our
brains so that we don't give up out of
fear that we don't give up out of
discouragement we don't give up out of
pain and that's that's one of the
important things about being thankful
for this great gift and there's a
smaller picture too uh a smaller picture
but it's still important is in being
thankful for each other and being
thankful for the small things in our
lives there's a a huge advantage in
being thankful for our half-filled
cups because most of our cups are half
filled in our life here we're not going
to have we're not always going to have
completely cops think about it um there
is no job that you will like
completely it's guaranteed it started in
Genesis chapter 3 where where God said
the world the the Earth is going to
produce thorns and thistles and and
weeds and stuff so when we have you know
hard co-workers to deal with and bosses
to deal with or some dirty ugly thing we
don't want to deal with at our job well
welcome to the club that's part of
life but
yet we can thank God that we do have
jobs we we thank God that we do have a
harvest even though we did have to do a
lot of weeding we thank God for that we
thank God that we have food on the table
we thank god um that we do have friends
at work we thank God that it is a
worthwhile thing and we also thank God
that we have freedom in our country
anyway to quit our jobs and look for
another
what about our our our our
marriages um we we think you know we've
got this weird idea you know I'm going
to find my prince and I'm going to find
my
princess and what we really find is
another human being who's just as sinful
as we are and has just as many problems
as we do and our half is our our cup is
never going to be overflowing and we're
not going to ever be absolutely complet
by these this other
person uh it's a fantasy but we have
this fantasy you know and if we're not
have a if we don't have a habit of
thankfulness we get ourselves into
trouble that princess you know who's so
delicate my my my very fragile flower
who is so who's so sensitive who can't
get to sleep even if there's a tiny
little pee underneath a a pile of
mattresses is oh she's so wonderful um
just wait for your first camping
trip okay uh you know and then the
prince you know that prince in shining
armor you find out there's rust over
here and some dents over there and you
find out there's a little bit of
froggin you know uh the Frog turned into
a prince but not all of them you
know that's the way it is in reality
it is you know if if you're married you
know that but you know uh if you're not
married know it beforehand okay but the
idea of being thankful for a half full
cup is essential because what happens
you start you start uh ruminating on
what's
lacking I wish my wife was like so and
so or why doesn't she give me this or
that or the other thing and I wish my
husband would be this that or the other
thing and before you know it you're
obsessing so much on what you don't have
that you really
want that all of a sudden you know your
princess is the Wicked Witch of the West
and your prince is is is the Creature
from the Black
Lagoon but but isn't that the way it
works I mean you ruminate on the you
ruminate on the the horrible stuff of
your job and you're ready to quit
anytime look anyone looks at you
crosseyed
so you talk about thankfulness you know
oh that's you know thankfulness we're
supposed to be thankful yeah yeah we we
we need we essentially need it we need
to keep on remembering to keep on
refreshing God's presence in our lives
and as we do that um we become more and
more blessings to other
people and the joy we don't lose the joy
that we initially have and that's part
of the purpose of it all we need to walk
with
god with thanks that he is with us and
so as we pray we include
thanks as we as we walk and are afraid
we give thanks that God is with us and
we remember that he is uh that he is on
our side that he is our father and he
loves us um
we do it all of the time we are to do it
all of the time and remind us ourselves
of this all of the time every time we
take the Lord's Supper we do this um
every time all of the songs that we sang
this morning we're reminded of what how
much
Jesus means to us take the time to
ruminate over the over the the meaning
of those songs to ruminate over the
the meaning of the Lord's Supper I
really appreciated that Ry having us
spend some time to quiet down um I've
heard I've heard people and it it it
bothers me I've heard people say um well
we got to do something we got to do
something about our worship services to
make it more meaningful because we do it
the same thing all over the time you
know
and what is it
about it's about the God of the UN
universe who became flesh and died for
us so that we could live with him
forever and defeat
death how can you get more meaning than
that I mean putting on a prettier bow or
a fancier a fancier rapper on that
present isn't going to do it you have to
understand what's in the box and if you
understand what's in the
box you have enough stuff to be thankful
thankful for for the rest of your life
and all of
eternity and that's really what we've
got and that's what I want to remind us
myself included of of what we're about
and where we're going when we get
together we need to be reinforcing
ourselves of our spiritual values and
our spiritual salvation and its value
and to any of you here who haven't said
yes to this
gift say yes if you you know if if if
you believe in Jesus and and and and you
want to turn from your sins and start a
new life come forward and be baptized
and start this walk of thankfulness and
I challenge all of us to continue in our
walk with this thankfulness and with
this
appreciation of God being in us and with
us and seeing us through all the way to
the end
