Earth
when you guys get to work in in the

uh and praise God it's awesome
um I want to recognize Rex for number
one giving me the opportunity to uh come
up here and do this
um how he comes up with two
sermons a week to me is just uh just
crazy it took me two weeks to come up
with this and this will probably be
about 6 minutes or so
um in fact I think what we're going to
do tonight is uh between my points we'll
we'll go ahead and have some coffee and
donuts you know go out and just just you
know kind of fellowship with each other
and then just come on back in here after
you know 10 minutes or so and you know
we should be uh we should be good to go
um but seriously it's uh it's great to
give Rex a little break uh you know
they've had a they've had a tough last
couple weeks so um it's nice to be able
to see him sitting with his family and
just uh just relaxing so that's
awesome GNA do something a little little
different maybe something that we don't
do very often up here uh I want to I
want to talk a little bit about a song
uh tonight
um but but
first I want to talk a little bit about
music uh music has been just a integral
part of of my life uh going back to to
my my mom who was you know music was
very important to her and she kind of
instilled that instilled that in me um
she got me into classical music all the
all the good stuff um Beethoven Bach
Mozart I still to this day you know love
listening to that when when things get
stressful and you know you put on The
Piano Sonata on there and it just it
just it just calms you
um she loved the music of the 60s Simon
and gar funcle CCR Janice Joplin
especially the Beatles She was a huge
Beatles fan and I think that's that's
where I got that from my dad had a
little bit of a a similar influence uh
it was mostly Willie and whan and Merl
Haggard uh none of that you know commie
hippie stuff
uh so needless to say music is very
important aspect of my family uh my my
kids were were brought up on the on the
classics you know the Eagles The Beatles
Zeppelin Pink Floyd all all that good
stuff uh all of my kids play an
instrument I think there might be a few
guitarists grewing around the house um
and I'm just so thankful that that they
have taken to that and and they just
they just love that um I even used to
sing to my kids and and you can ask them
that they'll tell you I used to do this
killer loud rendition of
um on top of spaghetti covered with
cheese and I would just sing that to the
top of my voice usually in the Middle
School Carline with the windows
down um and and they will attest to that
um but
uh but anyways uh you know music is kind
of a universal language it's it's
something that that you know we all we
all love it can relieve stress it can
evoke a range of of emotions Joy
Nostalgia happiness
sadness we worship with music we sing
together to worship and praise
God uh Psalm 951 says oh come let us
sing to the Lord shout joyfully to the
rock of our
Salvation when when we sing a song
together together to honor and to praise
God the Father it lifts our entire
congregation up you ever gotten chills
while we were singing a
song you ever choked up and almost
couldn't continue on to sing it because
the the emotion of the song and the
lyrics and the words just hit
you raise your hand if you have a
favorite song we sing at
church so
I know I've got several songs that that
that are great when when when we do the
greatest Commandments that when we hit
that fourth verse and everybody is
singing It's just incredible um but
tonight I want to talk about a different
song I want to talk about a song we
often Sing It Is Well with My
Soul when I talk my mouth goes dry
so this is a very spe special song to me
as it was my mother's favorite song it
was her favorite hymn and whenever we
sang it it would just it would bring her
to tears and uh you know the the
connection that I had with my mom and
music was was just kind of kind of so
deep that uh you know that that always
stuck with me
um but I want to talk a little bit about
this song I'm sure everybody knows that
there you know there's a pretty pretty
sad story uh behind this song um oh I
forgot we have
slides okay I just got to figure out
which arrow means that
way
okay so the lyrics of the song were
penned by a gentleman named Horatio
spafford
uh he was a very successful uh Chicago
lawyer and
businessman uh he was also an elder in
the Presbyterian Church uh he had
invested a lot of money in properties in
the city in 1871 The Great Fire of
Chicago destroyed most of everything
that he owned and it basically ruined
him
financially um couple years later while
he was trying to recover he and his
family were set to travel to Europe to
support his good friend and evangelist
DL Moody
uh there was still some zoning stuff
going on some business he had to take
care of so he went ahead and sent his
wife Anna that's her uh he sent his wife
Anna and their four daughters on ahead
aboard the French iron
steamship the I think you say it's the
it's the vild DU a you don't say the
H yep that's it right there
um so he was going to take care of some
things and he was just going to follow
him follow him later
uh but somewhere about halfway across
the North Atlantic the ship collided
with the British clipper ship the lock
er uh his wife Anna was pulled to safety
but all four of his
daughters oop there's the
crash uh all four of his daughters uh uh
were lost um am Amy was the oldest she
was 12 Maggie was seven Bessie was four
and 18-month-old Tanetta
so there were some survivors and they
were taken aboard the the ship that that
hit them and about nine days later uh
that ship uh arrived in Wales and upon
the arrival you know this wasn't uh we
didn't have phones and internet and and
things like that uh nine days later she
sent a telegram to to her
husband letting him know know what
happened
so it's kind of hard to understand but I
just it's it's that it's that first two
lines saved alone what shall I
do um I'm just trying to imagine that is
uh is tough uh upon getting the telegram
obviously uh you know he was crushed and
he soon after boarded a ship to go meet
his wife during that during that
trip uh the captain woke him up from his
bed and told him that they were soon to
be passing the spot uh where the
accident happened and where his children
were
lost so he went out and shortly after
that he was inspired to pen uh this poem
and it was later put to music by by a
man named Philip p
Bliss so that's one of the oldest um
Renditions of of the song that that we
have so anyways that's the story um it's
kind of heart-wrenching when you think
about it uh if you you can imagine
something like that happening and you're
on the ship and you have to stop at that
at that spot how how tough that might be
um
so what shall I
do have you ever asked that
question whether you're grieving or
you're suffering with illness health
issues maybe you're just overwhelmed
with life it happens to us all um at the
end of your rope
and and I can only stand here and talk
about myself but have there been
times I just don't know what to do how
do we get through this what do we
do sometimes we just want to go hide
shut the shut the world off shut the
people around us
off and uh sometimes it can just be very
hard to see through our own problems
that that God has a plan
how makeup
time I want to look at four themes or or
as Rex would say four truths
um from this song about suffering as a
Christian and how not to get lost in our
in our own sorrows and our own
problems so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to read I'm going to read the
verse and then and then we'll we'll talk
a little bit uh the first verse again
everybody knows this song um when peace
like a river attendeth my way when
Sorrows like sea Billows roll whatever
my lot thou has taught me to say it Is
Well with My
Soul and imagine this was written
shortly after passing over the spot
where your your four daughters were
lost thou Hast taught me to say it is
well we have to be
taught to trust God is to know
God uh look at Psalm 999 to10 uh if you
want to just open your Bibles I didn't
put slides up um but Psalms 99 and10 the
Lord will be a refuge in times of
trouble and those who know your name
will put their trust in you for you Lord
have not forsaken those who seek
you so to know God we need to seek
God we have to know God and we have to
and and how do we how do we know God we
read and we study his word God is
revealed by his word I want to give you
a couple ways God is is
revealed in his word uh first one is God
God has revealed
in his word through
Christ nope not ready
yet Colossians 1:15 to8 says he is the
image of the invisible God the firstborn
over all creation for by him all things
were created that are in heaven and that
are on the earth visible and invisible
whether Thrones or dominions or
principalities or Powers all things were
created through him and for him and he
is before all things and in him all
things
consist and he is the head of the body
the church who is the beginning the
firstborn from the
dead that in all things he may have
preeminence God has revealed to us in
nature Psalm 19:1 the heavens declare
the glory of God and the firmament shows
his
handiwork ever been out on a country
drive when the SC is just blue and a
couple clouds and you just look and see
that this this this work that's been
painted by his paintbrush it's it's
amazing um job 37 if you get into job 37
I'm not going to read the whole thing
but here's just a couple things I I
pulled out of there the Tempest comes
out from its chamber the cold from the
driving winds the Breath of God produces
ice and the broad Waters become Frozen
he loads the clouds with moisture he
scatters his lightning through them
at his Direction they swirl around over
the face of the whole earth and do
whatever he commands
them do you know how God controls the
clouds and makes his lightning flash do
you know how the clouds hang poised
these wonders of him who has perfect
knowledge God has revealed to us in the
Old
Testament
creation through Noah through
Abraham through the Kings through the
prophets
when you take on Christ in
baptism he continually reveals himself
to us by the Holy Spirit uh 1
Corinthians
26-16 is a little long but but I think
it's
important however we speak wi wisdom
among these who are mature yet not the
wisdom of this age nor of the rulers of
this age who are coming to nothing but
we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery
a hidden wisdom which God ordained
before the ages for our Glory which none
of the rulers of this age knew for had
they known they would not have crucified
the Lord Of Glory but as it is written I
Has Not Seen Nor Ear heard nor have
entered into the heart of man the things
which God has prepared for those who
love him but God has revealed them to us
through his spirit for the spirit
searches all things yes the Deep things
of God for what man knows the things of
man except the spirit of man which is in
him even so no one knows the things of
God except the spirit of God now we have
received not the spirit of the world but
the spirit who is from God that we might
know the things that have been freely
given to us by
God these things we also speak not in
Words which man's Wisdom teaches which
the Holy Spirit but with the Holy Spirit
teaches comparing spiritual things with
spiritual but the natural man does not
receive the things of the spirit of God
for they are foolish to him nor can they
know him because they are spiritually
discerned but he who is spiritual judges
all things yet he himself is rightly
judged by no one for who has known the
mind of the Lord that we that we may
instruct him but we have the mind of
Christ
that's a great line there we have the
mind of
Christ we're going to look at uh verse
two now this uh this verse is generally
not in the uh in the book that we we
sing from so this isn't something that
we we often sing when we sing the song
but it goes like this though Satan
should Buffet though trials should come
let his Blessed Assurance control that
Christ has regarded my helpless estate
and has shed his own blood for my
soul John 16:33 says these things I have
spoken to you that in me you may have
peace in the world you will have
tribulation but be of good cheer I have
overcome come the
world you see trials tribulations
suffering loss heartbreak
stress all of these things are pretty
much guaranteed to us we we you know
nowh in scripture does it say that we're
going to fly by and have an easy time uh
quite quite the
contrary but Christ has overcome the
world he has overcome
death 2 Corinthians 12: 9:10 my grace is
sufficient for you for my strength is
made perfect in weakness therefore most
gladly I will rather boast my
infirmities that the power of Christ May
rest upon me therefore I take pleasure
in infirmities in reproaches in needs in
persecutions in distress for Christ's
sake for when I am weak I am strong
sometimes that's hard to
see that that's hard to grasp grasp when
you're when you're struggling with
things
um Hebrews 10: 22:23 let us draw near
with a True Heart in the full Assurance
of Faith having our heart sprinkled from
an evil conscience and our bodies washed
with pure water let us hold fast the
confession of Our Hope without wavering
for he who promised is
faithful it was for my soul for for your
soul for our soul that Christ shed his
blood for us and that's something we
need to always hold on
to all right verse
three and this one this one hits
hard my sin oh the Bliss of this
glorious thought my sin not in part but
the whole is nailed to the cross and I
bear it no more praise the Lord praise
the Lord oh my
soul I love that
line my sin oh the Bliss of this
glorious
thought Christ offers himself
up
for a little bit of my
sin just some of this sin over here no
for all of my sin not in part but the
whole
that's just such a comforting
thought Colossians 213-
14 and you being dead in your trespasses
and the uncircumcision of your flesh he
has made alive together with him having
forgiven you all the trespasses having
wiped out wiped out the handwriting of
requirements that was against us which
was contrary to us and he has taken it
out of the way having nailed it to the
Cross when we put on Christ our sin is
dead to
us verse
four and Lord hates the day when the
faith shall be sight the clouds be
rolled back as a stroll the Trump shall
ReSound and the Lord shall
descend even so it Is Well with My Soul
you ever just really really had a bad
day at
work just nothing's going right you're
getting screamed at all day and it's
just horrible all you can think about is
getting
home getting home sitting on the
couch just just chillaxing doing doing
what you like to do with with with no
worries uh at least at least for that
moment
now imagine how awesome that'll be when
Christ
returns and he is returning whether
that's now in a year in 10,000
years it's been promised to us and we
know it's going to
happen 1 Thessalonians 4:16 to18 for the
Lord himself will descend from heaven
with a shout with the voice of an
archangel and with the trumpet of God
and the dead in Christ will rise first
then we who are alive will remain shall
be caught up together with them in the
cloud to meet the Lord in the air and
thus we shall always be with the Lord
therefore Comfort one another with these
words Comfort one another knowing we
have a home this this isn't it we're
we're here for a sliver I mean it's a
tiny sliver of time compared to the
eternity we're going to have with God
Hebrews 9:28 so Christ was offered once
to Bear the sins of many to those who
eagerly await him wait for him he will
appear a second time apart from sin for
salvation folks this this is our future
um all our sorrows all our fears all
Sadness Will Be wiped away we know that
we know it's been promised I don't
understand understand that I don't
understand how in in you know we we're
we're such emotional beings I don't
understand being in a state of zero
worry and zero fear and zero regret I I
really don't but I know it's been
promised to us for God so loved the
world that he gave his only begotten son
so that whoever believeth in him shall
will not perish but have everlasting
life everybody knows that that
scripture but everybody knows that
scripture for a reason that is so
powerful you guys believe that is that
your goal it's my goal it's my wife's
goal I hope and pray every day that it's
all my children's
goal that that we get to heaven and we
take as many people with us as as we can
I want to leave
you with Philippians 4 6 and
7 be anxious for nothing but in
everything by prayer and supplication
with Thanksgiving let your request be be
made known to God in the peace of God
which surpasses all understanding will
guard your hearts and Minds through
Christ Jesus
it's important to remember
that when we're struggling with
things grief you
know loss and and the stress of
life we're promised a home with God when
this life is over and we just have to
hold on to that
is somebody here struggling with
something have you not put Christ on in
baptism
yet we can help you right here right
now uh whatever your needs are I ask
that you come forward as we stand and we
sing
