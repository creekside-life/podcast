the purpose of this
sermon is to encourage husbands and
wives to understand each other to work
together so as to establish a grounded
spiritual relationship as God has
intended from the very
beginning perhaps more at any time in
history husbands and wives today need a
clear understanding of how they should
relate to each other in fact the
significant the significant social
changes over the last few
decades have led to such confusion that
the very idea of
Rose it's repugnant to some they feel as
if somehow they lose their identity and
their freedom if they had heard to some
type some type of outdated standard you
know a lot of people think that the
Bible itself is outdated and but we have
to relate to today's life in our terms
and God does
that many believe that setting up a home
with Biblical roles promotes male
dominance it's important for us to look
clearly at what the Bible says on this
subject and while the Bible does doesn't
apply our modern word role to
marriage the scriptures are clear about
the unique
responsibilities God assigns to husbands
and
wives to better understand our role in
marriage let's look at how we got to
where we are in the first
place after the fall of
mankind God imprecate a design for the
woman
to the woman he said I will greatly
multiply your sorrow and your Con in
your conception in pain you shall bring
forth
children your desire shall be for your
husband and he shall rule over you
Genesis
3:16 so let's look at one way presented
by
commentary the woman to the woman he
said I will greatly multiply your sorrow
and your conception and pain you shall
bring forth children your desire shall
be to your
husband now concerning your
sorrow and conception the two words
sorrow and conception or without
question
painful
always the woman's joy in conceiving and
bearing children will be saddened by
pain of
childbirth the other word desire when
paraphrased this curse reflects you will
now have strong a stronger tendency to
influence your husband and he will have
a stronger tendency to control and Lead
You The Battle of the Sexes has
begun each strive to control and neither
lives in the best interest of the other
Eve influenced Adam to partake of the
forbidden
fruit so we know that women or our wives
that definitely have some type of
influence on us I mean even before she
Sinn she had some type of influence on
it so after the S down that influence
got
stronger so just like any other sermon I
have a story too this is my
story there's this story of a man who
died and went to Purgatory to find two
signs above two different
lines one sign said all those men who
have been dominated by their wives stand
here that line of men seemed to
stretch off through the clouds into
eternity the second sign read all those
who have never been dominated by their
wives stand
here underneath the sign stood one man
the attendant went over to the man
grabbed his arm and said what's the
secret how did you do
it the other line has millions of men
and you are the only one standing in
this line the man looked around
puzzled and he said why I am not sure I
know my wife just told me to stand
here so some of us do do what our wives
say but that was the
story though there's disparity and
strife between the two male female
husband wife God has a
plan
wives God has given you a unique
opportunity to bring him glory
specifically through your
marriage his plan for marriage is to
glorify him to display or reflect what
is true in him and show the world a
picture of the Gospel what a joy to
think about facts that you can reflect
the character of God and the Heart of
the Gospel to your husbands in a very
personal and beautiful way
so you do have a big influence on us and
thanks God that uh it's the C it's the
gospel that you can share with your
husband or the ways you treat him or the
way he treats you the two you can two of
you can live in
harmony to bring this out of
control marital
situation back to God back what God had
originally intended it to be he
implemented guidances to establish life
saving marital controls what does God
have in mind here are a key passages
from
scripture Ephesians 5
22 wiv submit your own to your own
husband as the Lord as to the Lord for
the husband is the head of the
wife as also Christ is head of the
church and and he is the savior of the
body therefore just as the church is
subject to Christ so let the wives be to
their own husbands and
everything the Greek word for submitting
does not
refer to being under the absolute
control of anyone but is voluntarily
placing yourself under the authority of
another
person in 1 Peter 31 one the Apostle
gives the following admonition
admonition to wives likewise wives be
subject to your own
husbands though the command is
clear let's not glass over the word
likewise Peter is making a comparison
and asking wives to follow an
example but what
example the verse immediately preceding
it for Peter 2
21-25 is talking about the example of
Jesus it is a beautiful thing to realize
that God is not asking the woman to do
something Jesus has unwilling done
unwillingly done in fact Christ
submission is
shocking he is the sinless God first
Peter
222 but was willing to suffer under
submission 1 Peter 2 24 in order to pay
for our
Salvation many Christian wives through
their obedience and efforts in following
Christ know that wives a wives
responsibility can be properly
understood in the context of loving
servant leading by their
husband here are some roles and
qualities of a Christian wife as she
works with her her husband to be or
become the man God wanted him to
be
hey be a helper to your
husband while all of us are called to be
helpers to others the Bible places a
special emphasis in this responsibility
for wives Genesis tells us God realized
it wasn't good for man to be
alone and that he decided to make a
helper fit for him Genesis
2:18 it is interesting to note that the
Hebrew meaning of the word helper In
this passage is found Hereafter in the
Bible to refer only to God as he helps
us the fact that this same word is
applied to a wife signifies that women
have been given tremendous power for
good in in their
husbands God has designed wives to help
the husbands become all that God in
thingss for them to
be
B submit to the leadership of your
husband when a wife submits to her
husband she is glorifying
God as she follows the examples of Jesus
Christ it's a beautiful thing it's a
beautiful truth marriage is an
institution established by God this
institution like
many has a god designed structure in
this structure God commands the wife to
S me to her husband Ephesians 5:22
through
24 this structure has roles and
responsibilities but submission is first
about a wife's own love relationship
with
Jesus when a wife places herself under
her husband's Authority she is really
placing herself under God's Authority
wise shouldn't Place shouldn't Place
their hope in their fallible husbands
rather in an infallible
God first Peter 3 3
3-5 do not let your adorning be exteror
external the braiding of your hair and
the putting on the gold jewelry or the
clothing you where but let your adorning
be the hidden person of the heart with
the imperishable beauty of a gentle and
quiet Spirit which in God's sight is
very precious for this is how the holy
women who hoped in God and used to Adorn
themselves by submitting to their own
husbands submission is ultimately about
trusting
God who controls every detail of Our
Lives for his glory and for our good
Romans 8
28-29 see respect your
husband Ephesians 5:33 Paul says let the
wife see that she respects her husband
when you respect your husband you notice
him regard him honor him prefer him and
esteem him it means valuing his opinion
admiring his wisdom and
character appreciating his commitment to
you and considering his needs and
values primary needs of most men self
con uh
confidence in their personhood as a man
to be listened to
companionship and to be needed
meeting these needs is what is
respecting your husband is all about the
maral
man is a self contained independent and
invulnerable person and it is a
myth to booler your husband's confidence
encourage him by being his number one
fan his cheerleader
every husband wants his wife to be on
his
team to coach him when
necessary that means a lot and sometimes
coaching comes the wrong way it could be
derogatory or the wrong direction a
husband needs a wife who is behind him
believing in him appreciating him and
cheering him
on D Love your husband Titus 2:4 cause
for wives to love their husbands a good
description of the kind of love your
husband needs is unconditional
acceptance accept your husband just as
he is and imperfect man love also means
being committed to a mutually fulfilling
sexual
relationship uh
oh what yall no about sex
there is a whole lot more to love than
sex
though but we are looking at how to
fulfill God's command to love your
husbands therefore we must look at love
from their's perspective not just our
own surveys show that love is one of a
man's most important
needs if not the most
important when a woman
resist
intimacy is
uninterested or is only passively
interested her husband may feel
Rejection it will cut at his self-image
tear at him to the very center of his
being and create
isolation a husband's sexual needs
should be more important and higher on a
wife's priority list than housework
projects activities and even the
kids this does not mean that you should
think about sex all day long and every
day but it does mean that you find ways
to remember your husband and his needs
it means you save some of your energy
for
him this keeps you from being selfish
and living only for your own needs and
worth maintaining that Focus helps you
defeat isolation in your
marriage
e helping your husband become who God
intended him to be the scriptures make
it clear that a wife should should
submit voluntarily to her husband's
sensitive and loving
leadership therefore for as she
voluntarily submit to her husband she is
completing
him she's helping him fulfill his
responsibilities and she's helping him
become the man the husband and the
leader guide intended him to
be okay we just talked about
women now I'm getting ready to move to
men I think we in a bigger mess than we
think we are but
uh men are men we are what we
are but we have DUIs and
responsibilities to our wives
also God's implicated design for
man Genesis
36-9 your desire shall be for your
husband he shall rule over you God did
not direct the curse at Adam but Eve God
cursed the ground Adam at the work
Genesis
3:17-19 concerning marriage and husband
and wife relations the scriptures
clearly give us the mou for being a man
a husband and a father they point to the
biblical role of a husband more clearly
than ever before
to the servant leader
concept when correctly interpreted and
applied these Concepts not only result
in Freedom for both the husband and the
wife but will also help them work more
harmoniously as a team as they comat
combat isolation and marital
conflicts I'm about to give you some
roles and qual is of a Christian husband
using the
concept of servant
leader one be a
leader the script scriptures provide a
clear organizational structure for a
marriage and we need to understand that
Christ is the head of every man and the
man is the head of the woman and God is
the head of Christ 1 Corinthians 11
and3 head does not mean
male dominance where a man LS it over
over a woman and demands her total
obedience to his every wish and command
God never viewed Woman as a second class
citizen his word clearly states that we
all are equally his children and are
equal in value and worth before him
there is neither Jew nor Greek slave nor
free male nor female for you all are one
in Christ Jesus Galatians
3:28 the teaching of the New Testament
clearly shows that women are to be
respected revered and treated as equals
with men unfortunately many husbands
degrade their wives by neglect or with
insensitivity and abusive treatment they
have abandon God's
design when God presented Eve to Adam in
the garden Genesis
2:22 Adam received her as a gift of
Great Value to God and to himself when
husbands particularly Christian husbands
don't treat their wives as a precious
gift from God and help me they are
denying themselves the opportunity to be
to become the man God has intended them
to
be Ephesians 5:23 for the husband is
head of the woman as also Christ is head
of the church and he is the savior of
the body therefore just as the church is
subject to Christ so let wives be to
their own husbands and everything just
as Christ is not inferior to the father
but is the second person in the
Trinity so wives are equal to their own
husbands yet in a marriage relationship
a husband and wife have different
roles in the Lord a wife's voluntary
submission arises out of our own
submission to God or the Christ number
two love your wife
unconditionally husband love your wives
just as Christ also loves the church and
gave himself for her Ephesians
5:25 Paul does not emphasize the
husband's Authority instead he calls on
the husband to love self
sacrificially
husbands are to emulate Christ's love
the kind of love that is willing to lay
down one's life for another person and
serve that other person even if it means
suffering your unconditional
acceptance of your wife is not based on
her
performance but on her worth as God's
gift to
you if you want to love your wife
unconditionally always be
sure her emotional tank is
full one of the best ways to do that is
to affirm her
constantly let her know verbally that
you value her respect her and love
her I have discovered that I simply
cannot do this
enough my wife and I have been married
for 54 years now look at me you think I
could have done that by myself there's
no way what about Dwight Dwight was in
the military too
what about the other guys who were in
the military when you were out there on
the road who you think ran in that
house you think whooped those
kids I don't think was anybody else
because when you got back on you still
had your
family bills were
paid cars got repaired my wife learned
how to change tires and she has helped
me to rebuild two engines
she knows how to be a mom and a
friend and I know your wives would do
the same thing to make you a better man
and that's why God put him here I know
I'm a better man because of her 54 years
I had to learn
something if you want to love if you
want to love your wife
unconditionally okay I just said that
there's no question that words
communicate
love but actions prove affirm and
confirm
it you need to do them do both as the
Apostle John wrote in one of his letters
let us not love with words or tongue but
with actions and in truth first John
3:18 one of the missing ingredients in
male leadership in the home is
sacrificial action when was the last
time you gave up something for your wife
something you genuinely
value like your golf game a fishing trip
and uh
oh final four sweet 16 your favorite TV
program who gave up that for their wives
y'all go shopping with it y'all turn
that TV off Hey baby let's go shopping
you do
that but sometime that's what it
takes sometimes you need to give up
something you enjoy so your wife can
have a break and see your love for
her number three serve your serve your
wife I hope I don't get beat up after
all this is is
over according to the New Testament
being head of your wife does not mean
being her master but her
servant Jesus washed his disciples his
feet John 13
1-17 Christ took on the very nature of a
servant when he was made man
human when he was made in that likess I
mean Jesus was a
servant Philippians
2:7 one of the best ways to serve your
wife is to understand her needs and try
to meet him do you know what your wife's
top three needs are right now you don't
have to raise your
hands is she worried about
anything what troubles her
what type of pressure does she
feel learn the answers to questions like
that and do what you can to reduce her
worries her troubles her
pressures what do you know about your
wife's hopes and
dreams do you know what they
are are you cultivating her
gifts if she has a knack for decorating
do you help help her develop
that does meek mean
weak number
four provide for
her this provision first involves
assuming responsibility for for meeting
the material needs of your family Paul
tells us in 1 Timothy 58 but if anyone
does not provide for his own and
especially for those of his house so he
has denied the faith and is worse than
an
unbeliever providing for your wife also
means taking the initiative in helping
meeting her to help her meet her
spiritual
needs you do this by modeling Godly
character by praying with her by
spending time together in God's word and
by looking for ways to encourage her
spiritually
to be a good lover leader and a servant
is to sacrifice your life to the gift
God has given you your
wife give up your life for hers and at
the Judgment seat of God you will hear
well done th good and faithful
servant Christ in the church Christian
marriage
Ephesians 3
2627 that he might sanctify and and
cleanse
her with the washing of Water by the
word that he might present her to
himself a glorious church not having
spot or wrinkle or any such thing but
that she should be holy and without
blemish in these verses Paul's briefly
outlines what Jesus has done for the
church first of all he loved the church
so much that he was willing to
suffer and die for it his actions not
only saved the church they also
Sanctified it in other words Jesus
developed the church into what it should
be the Holy Temple of God well a
marriage is the same way those young
folks who are getting married now they
have to do a lot of
compromising uh a lot of changes going
to have to happen uh you're going to
have to do things that's going to
develop your marriage into a strong
spiritual
relationship Robin jul didn't just get
there they had struggles just like Dory
and Mike
had everybody has troubles
Rex you think he his wife didn't have
problems what about the white now I
those are some guys I know been married
a long time like Luke we've been married
a long
time and we know it takes a lot I know
sometimes she wanted to kill me and I
probably would have gotten killed if it
hadn't been the
crime but I probably deserve it I'm a
man I do things you know and and
sometimes she's quiet she won't say a
thing she'll let me rent and raise like
a little kid and she won't say anything
and to me that's good because I've got
an aggressive nature anyway anybody
who's ever been in the military
something wrong with them they have some
type of issue they don't mind fighting
they don't mind fighting
back and not everybody who went to the
military that way they just a man's
tendences and
characters we kind of messed up and if I
had time I would read you a whole list
of what men are
like and I to contrast that about what
women are like and then you will see
they balance out each
other can you imagine if a woman was
like a man oh my
goodness Ephesians
3:28 so husbands ought to love their own
wives as their own bodies he who loves
his wife loves
himself for no one ever hated his own
flesh but nourishes and cherishes it
just as the Lord does a church a man who
realizes that his wife is truly his own
flesh he'll treat her with love and
care Ephesians 3:30
for we are members of his body of his
flesh and of his bones for this reason a
man shall leave his father and mother
and be joined to his wife and the two
shall be one flesh Genesis
2:4 teaches that the special Union
between husband and
wife supersedes the original Family Ties
30 verse 32 this is a great mystery but
I speak concerning Christ and the
church the
mystery a sacred secret
revealed is that Christian marriage
parallels the union that exists Spirit
spiritually between Christ and his bride
the
church Ephesians 3
33 Let each one of you in particular so
love his own wife as
himself and let the wife see that she
respects her
husband this is the antidote that
restores mutual
respect and
dignity
conclusion building on Oneness in
marriage works best when both spouses
choose to fulfill their
responsibilities
voluntarily with no pressure or
corrosion to become the servant leader
God has commanded him to be he needs to
be he needs her gracious respect and
submission and when he loves her the way
he is commanded
to she can more easily submit herself to
that
leadership she does this with an
attitude of entrusting herself to
God in one of his letters Peter told us
that even though Jesus suffered terrible
pain and
insults he did not
retaliate continued entrusting himself
to him who judges
justly 1 Peter 2:23
when you entrust your life to the father
it's much easier to be the husband or
wife of an imperfect
spouse
especially when you may have
disagreements a special
note some of you may leave may live with
abuse or in excessively unhealthy and
destructive condition in your
marriage at times it may be
inappropriate or even lifethreatening
for you to apply
unquestionably the principles of
submission for example if you are being
mentally physically or verbally abused
you need to take steps to protect
yourself and your
children please
discerningly seek out your elders
ministers or someone else who has been
trained to help you in your
special with your specific
issues loving forgiving and submitting
do not mean that you become a doormat or
you in definitely tolerate significantly
destructive
Behavior now for those of you who may
have issues with your marriage or just
like to some advice we have that H the
church brother Dwight is a marriage
counselor I mean I wrote all of this
stuff from from references that I ran
into and taking experiences from My Wife
