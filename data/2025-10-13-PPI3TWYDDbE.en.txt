I don't know how long ago it was that I
actually read this book the first time,
but uh there's a book by a guy named
William Willleman that I read in one of
the chapters uh he dealt with this topic
that God came back
and it really stuck with me. And so this
evening, that's what I want to talk with
you about.
God did with dead Jesus
what he wants to do with us every day.
Let me say that again. God did with dead
Jesus what he wants to do with us every
day.
That is the thick theological thought
that I'd like us to try to wrap our
minds around this evening.
Nobody expected Jesus to actually
conquer death.
Those who went to the empty tomb that
morning were unprepared for what they
discovered,
unbelieving of what they saw.
In truth, there's simply nothing in this
life that can prepare you for
resurrection,
for life over death.
Now we know and they knew uh long before
in fact that God is in the business of
life. He is not in the business of
death.
And it is the church's claim in reading
the old and new testaments together that
the whole saving history of God's
dealing with us is a story of the steady
overcoming his overcoming of death's
dominion.
But we too much in the business of
death, too used to death, too caught up
in the wake of death, still seem to have
trouble believing life.
Let me remind you of a story from the
gospel account of John. I'm going to
start in chapter 11 verse number one.
Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of
Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister
Martha. It was that Mary who anointed
the Lord with fragrant oil and wiped his
feet with her hair, whose brother
Lazarus was sick. Therefore the sister
sent to Jesus, saying, Lord, behold, he
whom you love is sick. When Jesus heard
that, he said, "This sickness is not
unto death, but for the glory of God,
that the Son of God may be glorified
through it."
Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister
and Lazarus. So when he heard that he
was sick, he stayed two more days in the
place where he was. Then after this he
said to the disciples, "Let us go to
Judea again."
The disciples said to him, "Rabbi,
lately the Jews sought to stone you, and
are you going there again?" Verse number
11. He said to them, "Our friend Lazarus
sleeps, but I go that I may wake him
up." Then the disciples said,"Lord, if
he sleeps, he'll get well." However,
Jesus spoke of his death. But they
thought he was speaking about taking
rest in sleep. Then Jesus said to them
plainly, "Lazarus is dead."
And I'm glad for your sakes that I was
not there that you may believe.
Nevertheless, let us go to him. Verse
17. So when Jesus came, he found that he
had already been in the tomb four days.
Now Bethany was near Jerusalem about two
miles away and Jews had joined the women
and to comfort them concerning their
brother. Then Martha as soon as she
heard the
met was sitting in the house. Now Martha
said to Jesus, "Lord, if you had been
here, my brother would not have died.
But even now I know that whatever you
ask of God, God will give you." Jesus
said to her, "Your brother will rise
again."
Martha said to him, "I know that he'll
rise again and the resurrection at the
last day."
Jesus said to her, "I am the
resurrection and the life. He who
believes in me, though he may die, he
shall live, and whoever lives and
believes in me shall never die."
Do you believe this?"
She said to him, "Yes, Lord. I believe
that you are the Christ, the son of God,
who is to come into the world. And when
she had said these things, she went her
way and secretly called Mary, her
sister, saying, "The teacher has come
and is calling for you." As soon as she
heard that, she arose quickly and came
to him. Now Jesus had not yet come into
the town, but was in the place where
Martha met him. Then the Jews who were
with her in the house, and comforting
her, when they saw that Mary rose up
quickly and went out, followed her,
saying, "She's going to the tomb to weep
there." Then when Mary came where Jesus
was and saw him, she fell down at his
feet, saying to him, "Lord, if you'd
been here, my brother would not have
died."
Therefore, when Jesus saw her weeping
and the Jews who came with her weeping,
he groaned in his spirit and was
troubled.
And he said, "Where have you laid him?"
And they said to him, "Lord, come and
see."
Jesus wept.
Then the Jews said, "See how he loved
him?" And some of them said, "Could not
this man who opened the eyes of the
blind also have kept this man from
dying?"
Then Jesus, again groaning in himself,
came to the tomb. It was a cave and a
stone lay against it. Jesus said, "Take
away the stone." Martha, the sister of
him who was dead, said to him, "Lord, by
this time there's a stench. He's been
dead four days."
Jesus said to her, "Did I not say to you
that if you would believe, you would see
the glory of God?"
Then they took away the stone from the
place where the dead man was lying. And
Jesus lifted up his eyes and said,
"Father, I thank you that you have heard
me, and I know that you always hear me.
But because of the people who are
standing by, I said this that they may
believe that you sent me." Now when he
had said these things, he cried with a
loud voice, Lazarus,
come forth.
And he who had died came out bound hand
and foot with grave clothes, his face
wrapped with a cloth. And Jesus said to
them, "Loose him and let him go." Then
many of the Jews who had come to Mary
and had seen the things Jesus did
believed in him. But some of them went
away to the Pharisees and told them the
things Jesus did. Then the chief priests
and the Pharisees gathered a council and
said, "What shall we do? For this man
works many signs. If we let him alone
like this, everyone will believe in
him." Chapter 12 verse 1. Then 6 days
before the Passover, Jesus came to
Bethany where Lazarus uh was who had
been dead whom he had raised from the
dead. There they made him a supper and
Martha served. But Lazarus was one of
those who sat at the table with him.
Verse number nine. Now a great many of
the Jews knew that he was there. And
they came not for Jesus' sake only, but
that they might also see Lazarus, whom
he had raised from the dead. But the
chief priests plotted to put Lazarus to
death also, because on account of him,
many of the Jews went away and believed
in Jesus.
It's a familiar story, isn't it?
We don't read it in its detail very
often, but it's an important story.
You see, for as far as scripture is
concerned, the resurrection of Jesus,
when we get to the resurrection of
Jesus, that's the final signal. It's not
the opening shot. It's the final signal
of God's ultimate victory over death.
Think about it. Even the resurrection of
Lazarus comes along towards the end of
the story. And every time somebody once
crippled stands up and walks or somebody
blind opens his eyes and sees, what we
should be seeing is death slowly losing
its grip.
But in spite of all of that and more
scores more, there's something about us
that still finds comfort in the darkness
of the tomb.
Confident it would appear that death
just is.
This congregation in the time that we've
been here has known its fair share of
death.
We've all experienced the loss. We've
all felt the pain.
Keegan mentioned this morning just a few
weeks ago that we got word that Dorian
Flynn had passed away.
Here's my question about that. When it's
somebody close, can we talk about it?
Or must we grieve together but alone in
silence?
What is it for Christians that makes
this topic still such a sensitive one?
Some might say, "Well, it's just too
soon. It's just too raw." But I would
argue time's not nearly the healing balm
that it's so often made out to be. In
truth, the best that time can do is
distract us from the pain.
Death hurts.
It stings. That's why the Bible talks
about the sting of death. It hurts.
And the only thing that can heal that
kind of pain is an absolute awareness of
God's power over it.
How tremendously important then are
those words spoken first to the women
who went to the Lord's tomb that Sunday
morning to tend to his dead body.
Why do you seek the living among the
dead? He is not here. He has risen.
That's where the subject of the lesson
came from. God came back.
But it wasn't the first time. In Exodus
1 verse number 8, the Bible reads,
"There arose a new king over Egypt who
did not know Joseph." Remember that
story? that Pharaoh made the children of
Israel slaves. He placed horrible
burdens on their backs and killed their
baby boys.
But God came back to Moses minding his
business when a bush burst into flame
and a voice said, "I've heard the cry of
my people. I'm going head-to-head with
Pharaoh to free them. Guess who's going
to help me?"
And Moses stammered and tried to make
excuses, but God came back. Now, would
you be surprised to learn that lots of
God's people loved it in slavery?
Oh, the work was hard, but at least he
got three meals a day. And Pharaoh's not
so bad once you learn to adjust. After a
while, your back becomes calloused to
the sting of the taskmaster's whip. You
don't even resent it anymore.
Really.
Fast forward from that story to a little
backwater town in first century Judea.
Now Roman troops are on every corner.
God's people again are in servitude. Not
to God, mind you, but to the world's
most powerful army and a most ruthless
dictator.
But what are you going to do? What is
anybody going to do? We adjust.
It's just a census. Just keep your head
down. One day Messiah will come and
we'll be in power once more.
But you see, God was still in power.
And in a feed trough in a Bethlehem
livery, God came back.
And as much as we should, brothers and
sisters, each time we hear those words,
God came back. We should realize that
this message, the Bible's message, is
about God's unwavering, rocksolid
faithfulness.
Well, around the corner comes a
surprise. Something unexpected.
Something that knocks us down. Something
that knocks us for a loop. And we grab
almost instinctively for despair.
God came back.
But those he came to rescue, those who
were supposed to be his people, rejected
him and ultimately crucified him.
So my question, did Jesus crucifixion
that Friday really take anyone by
surprise?
I mean, anybody who knows anything about
the way this old world works knows that
Jesus was doomed from the very start.
The way he disregarded social
convention, eating with tax collectors
uh and harlots, the way he reached out
to those society could barely tolerate,
the things that he spoke to the clergy.
No, everyone pretty much expected
Friday.
You just can't fight city hall. So what
do you do? Adjust.
It was a good campaign while it lasted,
but we didn't get him elected Messiah
this time around. You women go on out to
the cemetery. Pay our last respects.
We'll be along later in the day. But he
wasn't there.
Why do you seek the living among the
dead? He's not here. He is risen.
Remember
how he spoke to you when he was still in
Galilee, saying, "The Son of Man must be
delivered into the hands of sinful men
and be crucified and the third day rise
again." Did you catch it? God came back.
Here, the Apostle Paul rock solid in his
faith in Jesus because of his rock-solid
awareness of God's power over death. 1
Corinthians 15:22, "As in Adam all die,
even so in Christ all shall be made
alive." Did you hear it? Defiant almost.
As in Adam all die, even so in Christ
all shall be made alive.
God came back.
In fact, just a few verses before 1
Corinthians 15:22 and verse number 19 of
the same text, the apostle said, "If in
Christ we have hope in this life only,
we are of all people most to be pied."
So I ask, when will we
become accustomed to death's defeat and
to God's victory?
When will we accept that the entire
history of God's intrusions among us is
really about resurrection to life from
the depths of the grave?
What will we do about it? Adjust
or listen to his call from beyond the
grave and live?
I'm going to read now from Romans 6
beginning in verse number one. What
shall we say then? Shall we continue in
sin that grace may abound? Certainly
not. How shall we who died to sin live
any longer in it? Or do you not know
that as many of us as were baptized into
Christ Jesus were baptized into his
death? Therefore, we were buried with
him through baptism into death, that
just as Christ was raised from the dead
by the glory of the father, even so we
also should walk in newness of life. For
if we have been united together in the
likeness of his death, certainly we also
shall be in the likeness of his
resurrection. Knowing this, that our old
man was crucified with him, that the
body of sin might be done away with,
that we should no longer be slaves of
sin. For he who has died has been freed
from sin. Now, if we died with Christ,
we believe that we shall also live with
him, knowing that Christ, having been
raised from the dead, dies no more.
Death no longer has dominion over him.
For the death that he died, he died to
sin once for all. But the life that he
lives, he lives to God. Likewise, you
also reckon yourselves to be dead indeed
to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus
our Lord.
Can you hear it, church? It's a
different way of thinking.
It's understanding that because of
Jesus, we have the victory now. We're
not waiting for the victory someday.
Maybe we have it now. Because the God
who is faithful and who came back is
faithful and will come again. There'll
be a shout. There'll be the trumpet call
of God and we will be redeemed because
he will stand in place for us in the
judgment. We have it now.
So,
it's going to be short.
How you like them apples?
Six lessons from the empty tomb. Are you
ready? Six lessons from the empty tomb.
Number one,
you can never be in so forsaken a place
that I cannot find you.
You can never be in so forsaken a place
that I cannot find you.
Number two, you can never be in so
desperate a state that I cannot lift
your soul in hope.
Number three, there is nothing you can
face that is too big for me to conquer.
Number four, your story is not over
until I have had my say.
Number five,
look around.
I have you and your circumstances firmly
in hand.
And number six,
I'll just borrow the words of the
apostle. 1 Corinthians 2:9, "I has not
seen nor ear heard, nor have entered
into the heart of man the things which
God has prepared for those who love
him."
You want to hear that in more modern
vernacular? You can't go touring enough.
Nobody can go touring enough to see it
with their own eyes, to find it
somewhere. You can't go listen to enough
podcasts to hear somebody come up with
it fresh and new. You cannot You cannot
sit around long enough with your legs
crossed and your hands out like this
doing the kumbaya and come up with it.
You can't. I don't care how smart. I
don't care how much time, how dedicated.
You can't. eye has not seen nor ear
heard nor have entered into the heart of
man the things that God has prepared for
those who love him. That's six lessons
from the empty tomb of our Lord. We have
the victory and we have it now. It's not
just something that is to come. We have
it now. We have it now. Even in the
midst of trashy, terrible, no good for
nothing circumstances.
We have it now.
And so when you think your life's coming
apart and the wheels are coming off the
bus, he's got you if you'll submit.
When you're thinking there's just no
hope left, he's got you if you'll
submit.
Paul often concluded his letters with a
word of grace, no doubt inspired by a
clear understanding of the power of God
that is at work in us. So this evening
as we conclude and I'm concluding
and it's not even half past.
This is important. Where's Nathan?
I'm going to borrow this word of grace
if I may from Hebrews chapter 13
beginning in 20.
Now may the God of peace who brought up
our Lord Jesus from the dead, that great
shepherd of the sheep through the blood
of the everlasting covenant, make you
complete in every good work to do his
will, working in you what is well
pleasing in his sight through Jesus
Christ to whom be glory forever and
ever. Amen. And I appeal to you,
brothers, bear with my words of
exhortation.
Love all those who rule over you and all
the saints. Grace be with you all. Amen.
God came back. I don't know where you
are tonight. I mean, I know you're here
with me, but I don't know where you are
in life. I know some days, some weeks,
it just stacks and stacks and stacks and
stacks until I think, I don't know how
much more I can do. Any of you ever feel
that way? But he's got us.
So, if you're struggling with that,
maybe some time in prayer would do you
some good. If you've never submitted to
the Lord and obeyed the gospel, maybe
it's time to make that kind of a
commitment. If there's some way that we
can help you tonight in your walk, make
it known while we stand, while we sing.
