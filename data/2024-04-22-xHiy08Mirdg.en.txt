he was a little more enthusiastic than I
normally am uh but but good evening I'm
excited to be here this evening I'm
excited to to speak uh the opportunity

family uh there in Johannesburg and so
uh she's already sent us some some

that they can still salvage a little bit
of a little bit of their trip to South

afternoon I've got a really uh long
lesson plan and uh this evening uh I
planned to uh mow the grass today uh and
then I planned to take a nap and uh
neither of those things happened um
between finalizing this lesson and
realizing that the first bolts uh
playoff game was today I was a little
tied up um Unfortunately they didn't uh
pull it out but uh if you guys want to
follow along Austin great job thank you
uh we're going to if you want to turn to
your to Matthew chap
14 I also have a
PowerPoint and there's an outline in the
back uh if you want to follow along and
take notes I've promised one of those
every time I've gotten up here and you
know the old saying uh the fourth times
a charm so here we are but tonight's
lesson as you can see on the on the
screen is titled walking on water
Peter's Faith amid the storm let's go to
God in prayer before we before we
begin father we come to you now just
thanking you so much for this day Lord
we thank you for all of our blessings we
thank you for the saints that are
gathered here this evening father to
hear a portion of your word I personally
ask that what is said tonight is in
accordance with your will that you find
it pleasing to your ears father but that
it can be purposeful and it can be
useful to those who are who are here
this evening father whether they are
early in their walk with you or or
whether they they have been around the
block a few times Lord just ask that you
can help me convey this message that
help prepare their ears and that this
can all be done in a in a manner that's
pleasing to you father we thank you so
much for Jesus and it's in his name we
pray
amen so we start out here in Matthew 14
I'm going to move this up just a hair
y'all let me know if you can't hear
me a and we see the story of
Jesus walking on
water and three of the four gospels
record this story it's found in Matthew
Mark and and John uh but the Book of
Matthew is the only book that tells us
that Peter
also walked on water and so this evening
to hang out in mostly in verses 28
through 30 and and I really want to
focus on Peter's
experience in this section of Matthew 14
there have been many great sermons on on
this
topic uh sermons of encouragement to to
exercise your faith to walk in faith to
take that step of
faith and a lot of those sermons focus
on the idea that you have to get out of
the
boat a and and and those are great and
it's absolutely
true but I think there's I think there's
just something a little bit deeper that
this message can bring us um over the
weekend or over this past week as I Was
preparing I was listening to a few
sermons on this passage a and there was
a a Baptist pastor that I was listening
to uh that you know he was telling the
story that he had to leave behind a
lavish
lifestyle a multi-million
doll uh investment
business to start a
church and he likened that to Peter's
example of getting out of the boat and
he's not wrong the situation I think is
a little bit different though I want to
look tonight at Peter's example through
a little bit
different of a
lens and I think we need to to do that I
think we need to understand the
situation this happens right after Jesus
feeds the
5,000 with five loaves of bread and two
fish verse 24 tells us the circumstances
that the disciples were in it says but
now the boat was in the middle of the
sea tossed by the waves for the wind was
contrary also means against them uh if
you go to the Book of Mark Mark's
account tells us that the disciples were
straining at
rowing the what the Baptist pastor left
out of that whole story is he never tied
into the fact that the
disciples were already in a
storm right I I I wouldn't consider at
least for myself I wouldn't consider you
know a multi-million dollar uh
investment business and the lavish
lifestyle is a storm um it was still a
phenomenal sermon that he gave I'm not
not knocking that in any
way uh but I I I struggled to to tie
into the fact that they were
already in a storm and so understanding
where the disciples
were when we get to our key text
here I want to reexamine and just look
through another lens at Peter's faith
amid the storm you know we all have uh
storms in our lives and and some of us
may be going through through them right
now you we have emotional and mental
storms we have Financial storms we have
health storms we even have relational
storms
right and what I've really been trying
to question and I and I ask you to to to
ask yourselves the same question this
evening is how does our faith hold up in
those
storms you know for me personally it is
uh very easy to have
trust and and trust my faith in the good
times in the calm seas right when
there's extra money in the bank when the
family's healthy when when work isn't
stressful man it's super easy to praise
God to claim His blessings and to give
him all the
glory personally I'm I'm speaking
personally here I find it much more
difficult to do
that in the bad times or during the
storm I even begin to question my faith
at sometimes you know why
God when Ends don't meet when when work
is a mess and things just aren't going
my way I I sometimes
question you know how how can God let
this
happen and so I want to look at Peter's
faith and I want to see how we
can kind of relate it to to our own
faith this evening you know the Bible
tells us that faith is the Assurance or
the confidence of things hoped for it's
the conviction of Things Not
Seen Romans 1 tell 1 and 17 tells us
that the righteous shall live by
faith Romans 5: 1 and 2 tells us that we
are justifi justified by by faith and
Hebrews 11 tells us that without faith
it is
impossible to please
God Ephesians 2 tells us that we are
saved by grace through
faith and so this evening I just have
three simple
points they're not very uh indepth but I
want to look at three different things
from Peter's example and I hope it's
going to provide to you a little bit of
understanding a little bit of
encouragement and hopefully help you to
shift your perspective the next time you
find
yourself in a
storm see if I assume I'm going to click
the arrow to the right first time sorry
yep
sweet I'm techsavvy now all right so the
first point I have here is that I I
think we need to understand that Faith
forms
outside of your Comfort like I said
we're going to pick up in 28 and Peter
answered him and said Lord if it is you
command me to come to you on the water
so he said come and when Peter had come
down out of the boat he walked on the
water to go to
Jesus and so we've already established
that the disciples were in the middle of
the sea we've established that the
disciples are in the middle of a storm
they were already uncomfortable
but still that boat provided them a
little sense of
comfort Peter's Faith was not
formed in the
boat it was formed out in the
elements and so as Christians you know
we're not promised a life of ease you
could walk
around this this building right now and
talk to the many folks in this room who
have gone through some
things and when we're forced out of our
comfort zone a lot of the times we think
oh I didn't sign up for this this isn't
what I signed up for this isn't what I
was promised this isn't what the
preacher told me this would be
like and at times we even think why am I
being
punished but I think we should take take
a different
perspective I think being outside of our
comfort zone is actually a good
thing when we get
comfortable we start to think that we
can do it all on our own and that
Reliance on
God starts to go away but as soon as we
get outside of our comfort zone We come
running right back to God and it's a
reminder on why we must rely on God and
so what I what I want to encourage you
this evening is when when you find
yourselves outside of that comfort zone
outside of where you know you feel
comfortable is I want you to focus on
the fact that this is actually where God
is building your
faith and I want you to focus on the
fact that once you get through the storm
once you are out of the storm it's just
going to be another example for you to
be to someone else it's another example
of God delivering
you I want you to go back to think put
this in somewhat relatable terms go back
and think of when you were first
learning how to drive some of you it
might be easier to remember when you
taught your kids how to drive uh but go
go all the way back so when you were you
were learning how to drive and we just
talked in the elders deacons meeting
that we have some folks who use our
parking lot as as a uh a testing or or
or as a practice you know area and you
can drive around that parking lot just
outside or whatever parking lot you
trained in all day long you can practice
pulling in forward you can practice
backing in nowadays it's easier because
they have a camera I still don't trust
those things but you can practice
parallel parking
right but you still have to get out on
the real Road
right you can't really test your ability
to drive until you get out on the real
road with the real people in the real
element and so I
want us to think about these storms and
being outside of these Comfort zones
want us to think of them as as
tests James 1 12:4 tells us to counted
all joy when we fall into various
trials I used to I used to get so
annoyed when people would bring that
verse up when I was going through
something and somebody would tell me
I'll just counted Joy oh man it used to
frustrate me you don't know what I'm
going through you you you know you think
you do but you don't you've not been
through this
yourself but what I love here is is is
the next thing that it said it says
knowing that the testing of your faith
produces produces
patience some some versions uh say
endurance but that patience that that
patience that you form is a patience to
wait on the Lord and it's a patience to
not lose hope amid the
storm and so understanding that outside
of our comfort zone is where we are
tested and where our faith really forms
I want to encourage you that tonight
when you find yourselves there instead
of questioning you know how or why could
God let this happen to
me I want to encourage you to
pray and ask God God please show me what
you are
testing In This
Storm the next point this evening is is
that Faith focuses
on the we're still in the same same
section of of scripture and I'll read it
again and Peter answered him and said
Lord if if it is you command me to come
to you on the water so he being Jesus
said come and when Peter came down out
of the boat he walked on the water to go
to
Jesus so we see here Jesus is the one
that calls Peter out of the boat and
when Peter is focused on Jesus
he is walking on the water just like
Christ
did I I'm a big guy I'm not very
uh uh buoyant I think is the
word I could only imagine what it's like
to actually walk on water uh I I
remember I don't even remember the name
of the the TV show but growing up there
was a TV show they where they just did a
bunch of crazy different things and one
of them was they would put a little pad
on the water and there'd be three three
four five of them and the it was like an
obstacle course and you would run and
you'd step on one pad step on the other
and you'd try and get all the way all
the way across the water I think that's
the closest thing we probably would ever
see to actually walking on water and I
I've always wanted to try that so bad
I've never had the opportunity but I
know soon as I step on that first little
pad I'm I'm going straight
down right but but but Peter focusing on
Jesus is able to do
what no other man has
done and and the same thing is true for
us when we focus on the
Lord we can trust and we can take
courage that he's going to work things
out for his
glory the Eternal
good we'll come back to
that Romans 8:28 says and and we know
that all things work together for good
to those who love God to those who are
the called according to his purpose I
think we all know that we serve a very
Sovereign God we serve a God who is in
control of
everything and that same God that we
serve is the same God that can take the
situation that you were in that you
might not feel like you could ever get
out of and he can use that for good
and so when we're focusing on God in the
midst of our storms we can see and we
can trust that God will use
this for good that's not easy to do
trust me not easy to do you know for
Peter in this story Jesus walking on
water proves to him proves to Peter that
Jesus is in control of the very element
that the disciples are scared
of he's in full control of the storm
that they're in we're going to see in
the next verse Peter was still
afraid right and so it's even harder for
us because we've not been
firsthand uh
Witnesses of the Miracles that Jesus
performed we haven't seen him cast out
demons we haven't seen him heal the sick
we haven't seen him raise the Dead
so we have to make a conscious effort to
focus and to place our focus on the Lord
for
proof and to
remember his faithfulness there's a
saying uh that a lot of people say and
and I love it um because I think it is
absolutely true they say if you want to
see God's hand in everything you have to
put everything in God's hand
hands and that means attributing
everything to God the good and the
bad what we perceive as bad and so this
evening I want to encourage
you uh instead of instead of questioning
you know how or why could God let this
happen to
me I want I want you to when you get to
this time I want you to pray Lord please
help me to always remember that you are
in control and to help to always
focus on
you and the last last point this evening
I told you it was a long
one Faith does not fear the
chaos and Peter answered him and said
Lord if it is you command me to come to
you on the water so he said come and
when Peter had come down out of the boat
he walked on the water to go to Jesus
but when he saw that the wind was
boisterous he was afraid
and so I told you we're going to use
Peter as an example tonight the cool
thing about people is that every single
person in your life can be an example
whether they be a good example or a bad
example and when we look at an example
of exercising our faith in this
situation Peter's
both right he stepped out he took that
step of Faith he walked on the water
just like our savior
did and then he didn't
he took his Focus off of Jesus and he
started focusing on
everything that was around them and we
can't knock Peter for this right I'd be
silly of me to stand up here and judge
Peter for that we all do
it at the slightest inconvenience I'll
start focusing on my
circumstances I'll start focusing on the
wh ifs I'll start focusing on what could
go
wrong I'll immediately go to the worst
case
scenario and then I immediately start to
sink just like Peter
did but I want to encourage you tonight
because Faith doesn't focus
on nor does faith
fear those
things Isaiah 41:10 tells us that fear
not for I am with you be not dismayed
for I am your God I will strengthen you
I will help you I will uphold you with
my righteous
hand you know last week uh Sunday
evening Austin spoke about job and he
spoke about the armor of God I think
there's a reason that
faith is The Shield I think there's a
reason why Paul calls it that Shield of
faith and I it's because it protects
us it protects us mentally it protects
us physically and it protects us
eternally now for Peter that protection
that saving was
immediate if you go into the next verse
I I don't have it there it says in
beginning to sink he cried out saying
Lord save me and and and the Bible says
and
immediately Jesus caught
him what I want us to understand tonight
is that for us it may not always be
immediately this example it
was it it may not be
immediately and I'll take it a step
further it may not be in this
lifetime but Faith reminds us that even
if we don't survive this storm it's
going to be
okay and so this evening I want to
encourage you instead of questioning how
why could God let this happen to
me I want you to
pray Lord help me to always remember
your
promises and so I
know this was a short lesson I really
hoped uh that Keegan would go long this
morning so that our weighted average of
sermon time uh would be up to you know
rexus standards
but I hope three simple Concepts but I
hope that they can help you to shift
your
perspective and I hope they can help you
to guide your focus the next time that
you find yourself in a
storm if you can understand that Faith
forms outside of that comfort
zone that Faith focuses on the caller
and that Faith does not fear
the
chaos you're going to start
to realize that I'm just getting there
in my life just barely getting there
you're going to start to realize that
what happens on this
Earth doesn't really matter I used to
make the biggest deals of the smallest
things and there's times now I'm just
like it'll buff
out it and and and focusing on Christ
and focusing on God allows me to have
that mentality it allows me to have that
perception on
life but I think it's really
interesting
sometimes sometimes parents understand
this uh sometimes you have to go through
things more than once to really
understand the
lesson uh Matthew 14 continues that
after after Jesus saves Peter they get
back into the boat and the wind was
ceased the interesting thing to me is
that this is the second time that the
disciples have been out on the water
with
Jesus in a storm go back to Matthew
8 they're in a they're in
a boisterous storm again
they are
scared they get Jesus to calm the storm
and their question at the end of that
story
is who can this
be the second time he calms the storm if
you continue going I think it's in verse
33 here I'll have it on the
screen they come to the
realization truly
you are the Son of
God and so I want to ask you tonight you
know how many
storms has God calmed in your life how
many times have you not seen a way out
how many times did you think I will
never survive this this is going to be
it this is
it yet here we
are and I wonder when we're going to
come to that same realization that the
disciples did
that we serve a faithful and a merciful
god and that our Eternal salvation is
through his
son and that son came down to this earth
in the flesh he was beaten and tormented
he was nailed to a
cross he was buried in a tomb and he
rose on the third day and not only did
he rise from the dead he's now ascended
up to heaven to the right hand of our
God and
Father that's the Son of God that saved
Peter and that is the same Son of God
that saves
us so I know we have a couple baptisms
this evening already planned praise God
for
that the water's ready we can reuse it
it's going to be
warm so if you're ready to give your
life to Jesus or if we can help you in
any other way whatsoever this evening
please come while we stand and while we
sing
