Vic and I our baby was born 2 weeks ago
uh I am now a dad which is
crazy uh yeah we all know that's crazy
cuz I'm still going to grow up but uh
we've been we've been overwhelmed with
the gifts and I think we had I think it
was like 1,700 diapers stashed away in
the in the closet now so it is
overwhelming but thank you thank you
thank you I uh mom's Vic's doing very
well and the baby is a champion
he sleeps so it's it's been great um but
I want to say one more thank you before
we begin and that's to an answered
prayer I want to say thank you to God
for answering our prayer for eight
months I have been worried about Vic and
the baby my brain tends to go to the
worst case scenario so I've been having
sleepless nights on what to do what
could
happen and at the right moment and the
right phone call God sent an angel in
the form of Lee Andrews who was the
nurse who ran over and helped us through
the night and help deliver the baby and
she got to cut the umbilical cord and
she was crazy about that it was awesome
but uh it was one point at night where
there was a light behind Lee and there
was like a Halo behind her and I was
like ah there's the answer to my prayer
so thank you Lee Big Time thank you
thank you it took away a lot of my
stress all right let's get into this
lesson um I'll start by saying apologies
I have a baby uh lack of sleep but uh um
hopefully it makes sense the god-shaped
whole Let's uh let's go to our father in
prayer and
start dearest Lord Our Father God we
humbly come before you father you truly
are the Great I Am there's no one like
you father there is there's none like
you and father as we focus our minds now
and our hearts and we realize our
wickedness we realize that we fall short
of you we we struggle father we have we
have temptations and sin in our lives
father but father help us to realize
that you've done so much for us that
you've planted in us something that we
cannot even
describe that helps us to navigate and
focus on you father father we thank you
so much for your patience with us for
sending your son to show us the way to
help us fill this hole that we we uh we
long to fill father we love you so much
and we thank you it's in Jesus name we
pray
amen a god-shaped hle I'm sure maybe
some of us have heard of this it's not a
uh it's not a a term that gets thrown
around or used a lot but it's something
that I'm I'm curious about and as we get
into this you you you relate to what I'm
saying and and we'll share in some
experience in this but I want to start
by by telling you a story and this is a
true story and when I was young I was
about 19 years old I was blessed enough
to get my helicopter's license and it
wasn't long after that I took my
grandmother for a birthday ride it was
her birthday and we took her over the
heart of BEP Dam and the Heart ofp dam
is a beautiful place actually Scott
Natalie got got married over there and I
took my grandmother over the mountains
and there was a nice gentle ride you
know my grandmother look after her and
we flew back and she had a great time
but I'm 19 and I'm I got all the
confidence in the world man and I want
to I want to cut loose I want to break
free hey Dad jump in let's go now my
dad's not a very good flyer so he's just
there because he likes it I'm passionate
about something so he comes in with me
and I am just like let's go so we take
off and we fly East now that hole over
there is actually uh in in South Africa
it's the cullin and diamond mine where
they found the cullin and Diamond which
the queen then took I mean yeah gave
gave it to
her but that hole is very
deep and I'd flown over it once or twice
but my dad had never done that so we fly
out east we fly along the ridgel line
and in my head I'm playing the Vietnam
music you you know I'm coming down there
I'm having a great time my dad doesn't
know what's about to happen and I
haven't briefed him and I like to fly
really low so I'm flying really low to
the ground and just as we come up to
this hole before my dad can even realize
what's happening I pull straight up all
right straight up this helicopter's
going straight up and slowly I'm losing
air speed and as I'm about to you know
fall out of the sky hit the tail rotor
which flicks us around and now we're
facing the
ground and my dad is freaking
out and he is grabbing onto anything and
everything and I am giggling
hysterically and he is changing every
shade of green color that you could find
right and he's panicking and he's sick
and he's like what's happening and it's
just so so much fun for me to watch
right but I'm going to be
honest I looked back
down and I saw that
hole and for a moment I lost my
confidence my dad doesn't know this this
is the first time he's hearing this
but I lost my
confidence and and you kind of feel
anxious and I'm staring down into this
deep hole and I'm
uhoh maybe I've I've bitten off too
much and and I'm frozen for for a split
second and anxiety overwhelms me and
fear overcomes me and and I'm taking a
breath you know you know what I'm saying
you trying and catch your breath uhoh
what have I
done and this feeling that I'm trying to
describe to you is a feeling that is not
just
temporary the story that I've told you
yeah that was temporary we obviously
survived my dad knows so much
but but there's something that continues
in
us there's a hole or a void or something
inside of us that that we need to fill
that we feel like we need to fill
because I get anxious about it and
there's times when I'm aware of it
and and I kind of want to cover it up
because I feel like one day you're going
to see right through me and you're going
to see me for the hypocrite that I
am and so we try and fill this hold this
void with something with
stuff and this seems to me to be
continuous and
constant so maybe you start to fill it
with things have you ever jumped on
YouTube and just found a really nice
song an Acappella song or something and
for a moment you find
peace oh it's so nice three few minutes
peace it's
great you get to the end of the song and
you play it
again and you play it again and at some
point you start to realize that that's
fading off now and you go and search for
another song or something nice to to to
bring you peace to bring you
rest and there it's almost like a
scratch this this itch you you scratch
for a few seconds and then it's back
right
and so maybe we fill it up with
uh I don't know maybe maybe if I achieve
the job that I want I'll feel better
about myself I I'll feel that hole that
I'm I keep feeling that void that I keep
feeling so I set my goals onto a job and
and I get there and I achieve it and I
remember calling my dad one late at
night on the east coast of uh
Australia and I'm like Dad I I'm doing
what I want to do but I feel so empty
I feel so
empty what's wrong with
me and so maybe you start to fill it
with knowledge maybe some of us go to a
university and and we we achieve
knowledge and we think okay we can we
can better ourselves and I know that
I'll suppress that whole and I'll fill
it up and I'll be better and I'll be
fine and I'll have the confidence again
and I won't live in fear
anymore and and we find when we get
there that didn't work you all know what
I'm talking
about we all feel this maybe some of us
become the life of the party have uh
start to you know use alcohol to to to
suppress that
feeling maybe we we find it in in
relationships we we we try and suppress
that feeling with toxic relationships
or or friends
and for a moment in time it
works and so quickly it
passes you all know what I'm talking
about
right and so I'll be honest and I love
my
wife and I find in my relationship with
my wife there's still some hole there
that I can't explain and now that I've
had a kid and I'm looking at him like
wow this is amazing it's really cool but
they're still at ho
right what is that and it's difficult to
describe what I'm talking about because
I it's not really described in the
Bible there's maybe one or two passages
there that point towards us and we're
going to go over that but where this
concept came from was in 1967 uh sorry
19 sorry 1670 there it is uh a man named
blae Pascal he published penes
which was a defense of the Christian
religion and in that book he has a quote
it says what else does this craving and
this helplessness Proclaim but there was
once in a man a true happiness of which
all that now remains is that uh is the
empty print and
trace this he tries in vain to fill with
everything around him seeking in things
that are not there the help he cannot
find in those that are
though none can help since this infinite
Abyss can be filled only with an
infinite and immutable object in other
words by God
himself sounds very much like Solomon in
Ecclesiastes Vanity Vanity it's all vain
in vain I searched Solomon who had
everything power riches all of that
stuff he comes to a realization
it's all in vain if there is no God
what's the point what is the point in
fact I think it was
Niche uh atheistic view he said if there
is no God what's the point I might as
well just kill
myself what is the point we're going to
suffer I might as well stop that now my
actions may cause someone else to suffer
so why not end it now just end it all if
there is no God and he came to that
conclusion I think close to his
deathbed so I was scrolling through
YouTube and I found this
video of Russell
Brand now if you know Russell Brand he
is
not the best of human beings but none of
us
are but he has lived a life as a
sexaholic as an alcoholic as a drug
addict but what I found so fascinating
is what he said in this video
he said when it says in the Old
Testament worship no other gods than me
the implication I
offer is that we are a species that
worships and if you do not access the
Divine you will worship the
mundal you will worship the profane you
will worship your own identity you will
worship your belongings and you will
worship the template laid Before You by
a culture that does not want you but
gets you distractive distracted and
relative ly
dumb and I found that so amazing coming
from a man like
him because it's so
honest when I try and fill that void
with things and
relationships
and all things that are not
God for a moment there's a scratch but
after that I find myself staring into a
hole bigger than I knew
before and this is what he's saying when
we start to worship
ourselves if there is no God if we are
not striving to put God first we are
going to
struggle in Acts chap 17: 22 and 27 I'll
read Paul then stood up in the meeting
of the aegus and said people of Athens I
see that in every way you are very
religious for as I walked around and
looked carefully at your objects of
worship I even found an altar with this
inscription to an unknown God so you are
ignorant of the very thing you
worship and this is what I am going to
Proclaim to you the God who made the
world and everything in it is the Lord
of Heaven and Earth and does not live in
temples built by human
hands and he is not served by human
hands as if he needed anything rather he
himself gives everyone life and breath
and everything else from one man he made
all the nations that they should inh
inhabit the whole earth and he marked
out their appointed times in history and
the boundaries of their lands verse 27
notice this God did this so that they
would seek Him and perhaps reach out for
him and find him though he is not far
from any one of us
it seems to be something placed inside
of me a desire to seek God
out to reach out for him and find him in
Jeremiah 17:9 I find a problem with
this the heart is deceitful above all
things and desperately sick who can
understand
it my heart doesn't want to do the
things that I should be
doing oh what a Wretched Man I am that
the things that I want to do I do not
do and the things that I do not want to
do I
do my heart is wicked Ecclesiastes 93
the hearts of the children of men are
full of evil and Madness is in their
hearts while they
live so how am I supposed to seek
God I'm already at a
disadvantage Ecclesiastes
3:11 God has placed ET eternity in our
hearts how can we comprehend eternity
does anyone sat and thought we're going
to we're going to be around forever one
day have you thought about
that and ever and ever and ever and
ever how do we comprehend eternity how
do we comprehend something so so
big something so much greater than
ourselves so I put it to you that in our
wickedness that in our filth that God
has planted in us a seed and a desire
that urges us to seek out something
greater than ourselves objective
goodness objective morality honesty
truth meaning purpose
righteousness that's the hole I'm
talking
about and I find when I when I start to
fill that emptiness with
these I feel I start to feel like I have
purpose I have meaning
right so God has made Humanity for
Eternal for his eternal purpose and Only
God Can fulfill our desire for
eternity but you can choose to ignore
this Romans chapter 1 humanity is
ignoring this but there without excuse
now I have many atheist friends who
choose to ignore this in fact in their
statements I hear them say oh how they
hate God and uh sorry God doesn't exist
and oh how they hate
him makes no sense right they live in a
state of
confusion unwilling to accept who they
come from and who they should
serve so you can choose to to ignore it
but I witnessed that this doesn't work
out well for any of
us so how how do I find a
peace how do I find peace in a concept
placed in my heart that I cannot truly
understand or
comprehend or even describe to you
that's what I found Difficult about this
lesson how do I describe
this but you all know what I'm talking
about so I offer up a solution
if you haven't taken on Christ if you
are still
seeking I urge you to look at these four
points that I'm going to present to you
if you have taken on Christ if you have
filled this this this this void with God
and you found success in it I urge you
to follow these four points too because
there are times in your life where we
find we we find with we
doubt when we're doubting God when we
when we move away from God when we find
ourselves in sin again and we're kind of
lost this is a good
reminder as to why God or Jesus is so
reliable so Point number
one Jesus was
sinless John 84 uh
4546 he's talking to the Pharisees and
he says but because I am telling you the
truth you do not believe me who among
you can prove me guilty of any sin if I
am telling you the truth why don't you
believe
me well so are Kean yeah Jesus was
sinless we all know this understand what
I'm getting at
you this is huge he's standing before
the
Pharisees and he's saying to them who
among you can prove me guilty of any sin
and what's the response
crickets nothing they've got nothing on
him he is
sinless these are his
enemies church if I said to you today
hey who can find any sin for little old
Keegan you'd probably line up and get
ready to behind the microphone right I
know my wife has a
list it's it's under the heading of
things to bring up in five years
time and these are people that love me
my wife she loves me and she could
probably point out many of my
sins and so when I try and fill that
void with with people with you know I
look up to my parents and and I find
that they they disappointed they they
they weren't perfect okay I'll put my my
trust in my
friends yeah that didn't work
out you know what I want to put my trust
in
myself cuz I'm super reliable
right and that failed
too but when I look to this the
scripture John 8:45 46 Jesus is
sinless who better to put my trust in
than the only person ever to have
lived
sinless find another human being like
that come and tell me about them I'll
eagerly
listen Point number two
his ethical
teachings Matthew 5 and6 Jesus talks on
a whole another
level than we could comprehend you know
that scripture about loving your
enemies
yeah come on there are people that want
to cut my head off
literally I want to fight back
it's in me I want to fight back how dare
you talk he talked about righteous anger
last week
right that anger to fight
back and we have a savior we have a God
who says us know love your enemies his
ethical teachings are unlike anything
I've ever seen before no one else comes
close and so I
find that's bigger than myself that's
bigger than me someone who's sinless
someone who
speaks objective
truths objective
morality and I find
oh that works the third Point his
actions Jesus didn't just teach he lived
it out I'll give you this verse Luke
chap 23 33 to 34 two other criminals
were also LED away to be executed with
him so when they came to to the place
that is called the skull They Crucified
him there along with the criminals one
on his right and one on his left but
Jesus
said father forgive them for they don't
know what they are
doing how in the world is he able to do
that and then they cost lots for his
clothing I know me being me if that was
me I'd be like come on 10,000
angels let's sort this out right
now and we're all like that someone cuts
you off on the road well
forgiveness you speed up and you get
close Jesus is calling us to
forgive his actions speak louder than
words to me I cannot find anyone else
who's lived like
this outside of myself something greater
than anything I could find on this Earth
anything that Solomon could
find the final point there I put it as
Eternal but I think this is something we
really need to sit in our hearts 1
Corinthians chapter 15 I've been trying
to teach the youth this over and over
and over and over and over and over and
over and then they forget and then we
start again yeah
youth 1 Corinthians chapter 15 what is
the gospel Paul tells you what the
gospel is if you don't know what the
gospel is 1 Corinthians chapter 15 write
it on your hearts people now I want to
make clear for you brothers and sisters
the gospel that I preached to you that
you received and on which you stand and
by which you are being saved if you hold
firmly to the message I preach to you
unless you believed in vain
for I passed unto you of first
importance what I also received that
Christ died for our sins according to
the scriptures and that he was buried
and that he was raised on the third day
according to the scriptures and that he
appeared to seus then to the 12 then he
appeared to more than 500 of the
brothers and sisters at one time most of
whom are still alive though some have
fallen asleep then he appeared to James
and to all the apostles last of all
as though to one born at the wrong time
he appeared to me
also the sets in my heart
eternity Jesus was raised from the dead
he
raised from the
dead the story is not
over when God sets eternity in our
hearts and I'm trying to seek it and I'm
trying to find what that even
means I Look to our Savior I Look to
Christ I Look to God
and he's
alive so four simple
points that point to Jesus four simple
points that in my doubt I remind myself
oh yeah this is where I need to be four
simple points when someone says to me
why do you even follow
Jesus cu no one else can do
that no one else can fill that hole that
we all feel no matter if you're a
Believer or
not no one else can do that and so when
it says um in Exodus when it says you
should have no other gods before
him well that starts to make sense to me
because when we
do it is a life of
misery and maybe that's the choice maybe
that's the lesson that we're standing in
in heaven one day and maybe maybe one
day someone says
I don't want to be
here and I can turn around and
say I've lived I've experienced a
life where God was in the
distance and that was
miserable I don't ever want that again I
don't ever want that again thank you for
that lesson
Lord so maybe when we fill this this
god-shaped
hole with Christ
maybe that's what he means when he says
come onto me and I shall give you rest
you find
peace when you recognize that the Lord
is my shepherd I shall not be in want he
makes me lie down in green pares he
leads me by quiet waterers still and he
restores my soul and he guides me on
Paths of righteousness for his name's
sake and even though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death oh I do
that I shall fear no evil for thou with
me your rod and your staff they comfort
me
and you prepare a table in the presence
of my enemies you anoint my head with
oil my cup overflows surely goodness and
love will follow me all the days of my
life and I will dwell in the house of
the Lord forever
amen so if you're struggling to feel
that void that you don't know how to
describe that you don't understand yes's
the
solution God I know that sounds so
simple when we say it out loud but you
and I know that it's not always that
easy there are distractions and Satan so
church I urge you
um if you need peace if you need rest if
you are still
searching there's no better place to be
than with Jesus if you're one of those
searching for us if you need to find
your way back come as we stand and as we
sing
