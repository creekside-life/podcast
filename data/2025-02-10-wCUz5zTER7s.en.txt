there are many mystical
things uh that are hard to
explain and there are many mystical
things that are hard to understand
little less
explain for example what would you say
or
think if you found out that dragons may
have
existed well the Catholic Bible and they
get it from the septu
so if you think the Catholics are the
origin of this it is not and the
Catholic Bible is Daniel 14 or it is
Bell and the dragon separate but Daniel
14:23 is the way one of the versions has
it and says and in that same place there
was a great
Dragon which they of Babylon
worshiped uh Bell and the dragon is the
other name of it and there long story of
the that interesting get a chance might
read it roseen bar which is a Bastion of
helpful
information February the 13 2023 and I
quote there are full on
vampires and everybody still thinks I'm
crazy yep but I'm not crazy they're full
on vampires they love the taste of of
human flesh and they drink human
blood here's the real truth there are
still people who practice
witchcraft including uh
wiccans satanists mediums Chandlers
esoterics witches are for
real but they're not like they're
pictured in the
movies but they do exist
even to this
day there are many more though however
who aren't witches and who aren't
anything like that but they practice the
same sort of evils that are embedded in
Witchcraft and so that's the reason
we're going to do it the way we're doing
it tonight to try to speak to the
subject from a broader angle so that you
can understand that some of the things
you and I may have done
or
witchcraft number
one witchcraft is
rebellion what was read a moment ago in
verse 10 of Deuteronomy chapter 18 says
there shall not be found among you
anyone who practices witchcraft
interesting term practices witchcraft
here's here's the flip side of that
there could have been and likely were
those who were okay with it but did not
practice
it just as there can be people who are
okay with Rebellion but not necessarily
practice it thems practicing it was
Rebellion but it's more than that it was
stubbornness the reason I know that is
what was said to Saul when he offered
sacrifices after he hadn't destroyed the
people completely as he was told to 1st
Samuel 15:23 for Rebellion is as the sin
of Witchcraft this is Samuel speaking
directly to Saul the king for Rebellion
is as the sin of Witchcraft and
stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry
so when you're just being stubborn it's
about the same thing as bowing down to
an idol because you have rejected the
word of the Lord he also has rejected
you from being King we're not going to
look at all these other scriptures I
just want to lay before you enough
scripture you could go and study this
out just a little bit just in case you
have doubts that being
stubborn or being
rebellious is not the sister of
Witchcraft and now maybe you know where
it comes from number
two witchcraft is
seduction
seduction in verse 10 it goes on to say
there shall not be found among you
anyone who makes his Sons or his
daughters what's interesting about
witchcraft is it is connected to
immorality and having lots of
children but not with the ones you're
supposed to numbers 25 is a good example
of this numbers 25 and verse 18 I'm
giving you actually numbers 22- 24 is
interesting text numbers 25 1 through
five so I've given you enough that you
can go read about this this is about the
matter of PR
for they harassed you with their schemes
by which they seduced you in the manner
of peor now what's he talking about he's
talking about a plague that hit Israel
and it hit Israel at peor and it hid
Israel through a guy named balum a lot
of times you've read the story of balum
and how he was encouraged to curse
Israel you know that story well what you
may not know is the rest of the story so
you go away from that story and you say
is't that interesting the donkey talked
and he couldn't curse them and oh it
wasn't so bad after all but you got to
remember New Testament makes this very
clear that he did that for
money and he didn't quit at that the
Jews killed him later why did they kill
him well he didn't curse them killed him
because he was conducting witchcraft but
more than that he was involved in
seducing the children of Israel in
numbers 31:1 16 it says women caused the
children of Israel through the councel
of balum to trespass against the Lord in
the incident of peor and there was a
plague here's the point balam could not
bring a curse on them but he could
convince the prostitutes at peor to
mingle among Israel and get them engaged
to immorality and as a result of that a
plague fell on on Israel and they in
were involved in worshiping their Idol
at peor in the number one way they
worship the idols often in that day was
through sexual activity and so you may
recall when the woman was killed with a
spear here by one of the
Levites numbers 25 verse 18 numbers
31:16 and I've given you the others so
witchcraft is seduction so listen
when someone seduces
someone creates
immorality that's
witchcraft hadn't thought about that had
you number three witchcraft is
execution Deuteronomy 181011 says this
there shall not be found among you
anyone who makes his son or his daughter
pass through the fire or one who
practice practices
witchcraft
killing children and babies what do we
call that
today
witchcraft
witchcraft Second Kings 17 verse1 17 and
they caused their sons and daughters to
pass through the fire and practice
Witchcraft and Su saying and sold
themselves to evil in the sight of the
Lord to provoke him to
anger did you catch all that what's put
together there because it's the same
thing my brothers and
sisters killing children is the action
of a
witch Sous saying the action of a witch
selling yourself to the devil the action
of a witch yeah that's right you can
sell yourself to the devil
yes you
can oh you people don't do that yes they
do you can so execution of innocent
people is an act of
Witchcraft are you beginning to
understand why it's so evil stay with me
so Rebellion seduction into immorality
and execution of the innocent number
three
did it move there we go witchcraft is
superstition goes on to say there shall
not be found among you anyone who makes
his son or his daughter pass through the
fire or one who practices witchcraft or
here's the other
layers or one who interprets Omens oh
that means this or a sorcerer which
generally in the New Testament a sorc
cerer is anyone who would give you drugs
that is actually the meaning of the word
in Galatians chapter 5 it is the word
pharmaka which comes from the idea of
pharmacist and giving you medications
that you should not have which is the
primary way of many of the Witchcraft
Spells happened is they drugged people
even to this day in Africa the number
one way that a uh witch or Witch Doctor
performs much of his stuff is by
positing people and if you don't think
those people are evil do that come let
me talk to you afterwards and I'll tell
you what which doctors are really like
in Africa and what it takes to become
one it is not the kind of subject that I
should talk about in mixed company it's
that
bad or one who conjures spells or a
medium or a
spiritist and then in Acts chapter 8 I'm
going to start in verse 9 but there
there was a certain man called Simon
Simon who previously practiced and it's
have you noticed the word it's always
this way practice witchcraft practice
sorcery practice it have you notice that
interesting
he practiced in the city and astonished
the people of Samaria claiming that he
was someone great to whom they all gave
heed for the least to the greatest
saying this man is the great power of
God and you notice that that interesting
he's practicing Witchcraft and he gives
credit to
God so when somebody tells you well what
I'm doing well I I I pray about all of
this shame on them one has nothing to do
with the other anybody ever mixes god
with witchcraft is a vile
individual to whom they all gave heed
from the least to the greatest of them
this man is the great power of God and
they heeded him because he had
astonished them with his sorceries for a
long time and when Simon saw that
through the laying on the apostles hands
the Holy Spirit was given he offered
them money saying give me this power
also that any on anyone on whom I Lay My
Hands may receive the Holy Spirit now I
don't know what his power was I don't
know if he had miraculous ability
empowered by the devil I don't know
can't tell you doesn't explain it can't
go there I don't know if they were all
tricks like magicians I don't know
anybody that tells you they do know is
making it up doesn't say so I don't know
can't tell
you it could be that he got a deal going
with the devil and he thought he could
get a deal going with God and get some
power from from um Peter and John I
don't know what his thinking exactly was
I know the latter story you've probably
heard it about how he thought he could
fly and he ends up dying in Rome but
whatever the story
is they believed he had power here's the
deal it doesn't have to be
real anything that makes people believe
something that's not really
true is supporting
superstitions and when you're convincing
people to almost give up on the truth of
God or some weird kind of
belief that's
witchcraft be careful what you
say be
careful supporting
superstitions is a work of a
witch don't want to go there number
five witchcraft is
treason let me read on there shall not
be found among you anyone who makes his
son or his daughter pass through the
fire or one who practices witchcraft or
a souser or one who interprets Omens or
a sorcerer or one who conjures spells or
a medium we'll come back to that word
later or a spiritist or one who calls up
the
Dead one who calls up the dead it
doesn't matter how you call them up so
when you hear a Chandler oh the I was
born 300 th years ago and yeah doesn't
matter how you claim you do it now I
need to explain something here Exodus
228 you shall not permit a sorceress to
live or as the old King James says a
witch to live now does that mean they
had to kill them all no you didn't have
to kill them all they could leave leave
the country you didn't permit them to
live where they were they many of them
were not Israelites and I'll explain
that in just just a second hang with me
they were not necessarily Israelites I
don't know if this woman was but I think
she was bottom line is is that if they
left the area you didn't have to kill
them you can scare people away and get
them to not live in your country right
you can do that Saul not only allowed
her after he'd gone after them he not
only allowed her to live and live in his
area he used her and then he swore by
the Lord God God to protect
her so within everything that we
hold
holy he was committing treason to his
own country so I want to talk a little
bit about this word medium medium
because you may not know what that is
and what it's connected to so I don't
want to get too detailed because I know
this goes out on the internet and I
don't particularly want to give somebody
an idea how to do what I'm fixing to do
but I'm going to give you a little bit
of it okay I don't really want you to
learn how to do what I'm fixing to teach
you how to do to know it in detail okay
I'll give you a just seed thought and
then don't go looking it up okay there
some things be better off if you leave
it alone it's called ghost
pits ghost pits in 1st Samuel 28:7 it
says then Saul said to his servant find
me a woman who's a medium that I may go
to her and Quire of her and his servant
said to him in fact there is a woman who
is a median in indor the witch of
indor now median is an interesting word
in the Hebrew it is not a Hebrew
word it's in the Hebrew text but it is
not a Hebrew
word it's the word OB or OD that's it
it's a a little bitty short word and it
comes from the hit
ites
okay and the best that the Jews came up
with the meaning for it was was a
bottle but it this bottle had to be made
from animal skin and it's connected to
necromancy which is calling up the
dead but it is not a Jewish word and the
meaning of the word from the Hittites
and even the Egyptians which is an old
word and it been around a long time it's
very old it's older than the text that
we've got here and that is the meaning
of ghost pits little bitty word like
that means ghost pits and no you don't
know what that is and that's okay so
before fighting this battle Saul which
by the way ended up killing him and his
son before going to mount gaboa he was
about to fight the Philistines and he
worried and he should be because God
wasn't answering his prayer prayers
wasn't giv him any messages he's kind of
on the outs with the Lord
God but he disguised himself and he goes
to this witch this medium this
OB uh and he went there to summon a
ghost Samuel was dead now at this point
and he wanted to know what Samuel would
advice would give to him so this all
sounds on the up and up it's not but it
all sounds on the up and up so he's
going to a witch to have her call up the
dead through what was called a ghost pit
it's frequently done by ghost pits there
are probably other ways that people
attempted it and if you want to check
out that if there's anything in the
scriptures that refer to what I'm fixing
to talk about the closest thing is
Isaiah 29 and verse4 but it is the in
the new in new in the Old Testament
you've often heard the word familiar
Spirit okay uh familiar spirit and it's
s attached to like a cat or something
like that no there's no such word as
familiar spirit in the Old Testament it
is the word AB which means ghost pits
and so it was a woman who had a ghost
pit they possessed a ghost pit and this
foreign word from Indo-European Hittites
and Asia Minor um is in the text there's
no question it's there you can read it
yourself look it up go to that text
you'll see that little word there in the
Hebrew the best example of such ghost
pits comes from Homer's Odyssey 900
BC okay so it wasn't something that just
came into existence you know but it's in
the right time zone of this text it
comes from the book 10 of the Odyssey
with the witch
Circa she gives instructions on how to
conduct a ghost
pit and I've got them here I'm going to
read part of them but I'm not going to
read it all cuz again I don't want to
give you ideas cuz somebody's all to go
out and try this want to be cute you
know what I mean like a Ouija board stay
away from Ouija boards
amen all right so let me just read a
little bit of it then I'll stop I won't
read the whole paragraph when you have
reached the
spot so they have to be at certain spots
otherwise they didn't work which I've
told you about dig a pit in the ground a
cubit or so in length breadth and depth
and pour into it drink offerings to all
the dead first pour in the honey mix
with milk then wine and in the third
place water after that sprinkle Barley
Mill Over the Hole moreover you must
offer many prayers to the poor feeble
ghosts and promise them that when you
return
and I'll stop
there so ghost pits they have found
three ghost pits in Israel they're there
they exist archaeologists have found
them they know what they
are okay I want to change shift just a
minute it is more than likely that this
witch vindor was shocked to her
foundation when Samuel actually came
up more than likely if anything came up
to these witches in a ghost pit it was a
demon now what are
demons well I want to talk just a minute
about that what are
demons
demons are likely not just the dead
they're likely not the Fallen Angels
there's reasons for not believing
they're the Fallen Angels because the
demons believe there is a God and
tremble but if they were the fallen
angels they've seen God they don't have
to believe
so they've never seen
God so who are these people what are
they they're likely not normal dead
people some have said oh well they're
this powerful people from the it's not
likely but they were powerful it's
likely that they're the result of
Genesis chapter 6 this is the most
likely be belief of Jews and anybody who
really studies this subject they're
likely half humans and half angels the
angels that fell had children and those
children were Wicked horrible things
powerful and they died in the
flood so they're Supernatural Wicked
dead more than likely that's the best
theory that anybody I've ever heard has
on it can I prove that nope but it's the
most likely Theory and it makes them it
explains a few things if that's what
they were a sacrifice to Idols or false
gods were sacrifices to Demons we know
that the scriptures are very clear on
that subject Leviticus Deuteronomy 2
Chronicles 1 Corinthians all say the
same thing on that subject sacrifices to
uh the dead parallel sacrifices to
Demons we know that in the psalm Psalm
106 covers that very specifically that
when you sacrificed to the dead you were
sacrificing to Demons so there's some
connection between the dead and demons
again explaining maybe why that's true
dead Bess demons sought for whatever
reason to possess human bodies as if
that's what they wanted why would they
want that if they'd never been
that the dead demons have never seen God
like Fallen Angels so Fallen Angels
would never have you would never say
about an angel that they believe there
is a God the Fallen Angels know there's
a God they saw
him and Angels fa if that text is true
from being attracted to women and
particularly you might find this
interesting to women's
hair Angels fell for women had children
supernaturally Mighty and very Wicked
and they needed to be killed in the
flood because all their thoughts were
evil continually nobody's like that
today at least not usually most people
actually think good thoughts
occasionally but at this point we're all
Wicked and they all had to go and that
might explain that why the New Testament
says that these demons once they go out
of a man live in dry places why would
they want to not be in wet
places well went bad the last time so
witches familiar spirits the reason I
say all that listen to me witches
familiar spirits are likely calling on
these Supernatural demons if there's
anything coming I don't know that
anything's coming but she was shocked
and if that is the case then think
through it just a second witchcraft is
therefore treason toward God because
that's exactly what the Fallen Angels
committed don't ever look at them as if
that's a mild thing they committed
treason toward God in the middle of
Heaven yeah serious
stuff not to be taken lightly so I don't
really think you want to be associated
with this sort of thing
witchcraft is
rebellion it is sexual
seduction it is execution of the
innocent it is superstition about things
that you know nothing about and it's
treason toward
God anybody can commit those
sins you don't have to call yourself a
witch do
it I won't bore you with the truth about
aliens or Bigfoot
or dog man or
werewolves but I will warn
you I warn you about satanic
forces and thinking there's nothing to
it I want you to understand that deals
can be made with the devil Read Matthew
4: 8 and N if you don't believe that can
be done how is that a
Temptation if the devil isn't offering a
deal to
Jesus so deals can be made with the
devil and and I think a lot of people
living today have made
them there are Supernatural forces that
work all around us but listen to this
beware you can make a deal with
God I'm not making that up you can make
a deal with God the Bible is full of the
subject but most of us don't get it the
Bible is full of this
subject Genesis 28 20-22 that's exactly
what's being done in that
text Jeremiah 42 and 43 that's exactly
what's happening in that text it is
called vows you ever heard of vow a vow
is God if you will do X Y and Z then I
will do X Y and Z it's a votive offering
look it up in your Bible it is all
through it yes you can make a deal with
God
but if you make a deal with God you
better fulfill your end of it if God
comes through for you it gives you what
you asked him to give for you and you've
promised this if you does that you
better pay
up you better pay up and if you don't
think that's all through the scriptures
about you better pay up there are many
warnings on that don't you dare fail to
put toward God what you've vow whatever
that
is and there are Supernatural forces
that work all around us all the time and
if you think that's not true what is it
you think Angels do what is it that you
think the Holy Spirit does what is it
you think Providence is if it isn't God
working all things together for good for
those who love the Lord the those who
are called according to his purpose what
do you think those forces are what's the
point of having a prayer if you don't
think Supernatural forces are work all
around
us if it's all going to happen naturally
anyway let's not
pray but do not live in fear so let me
stop here I'm going to end here do not
live in fear of the devil or witches or
anything like
that it's silly to fear it William
copper wrote this
God made bees and bees made honey God
made man and man made money Pride made
the devil and the devil made sin so God
made a pit to put the devil
in God's going to take care of the devil
you don't have to worry about that he
made a place specially for him y'all
remember the curse that was placed on
the church
how many of here the day it
happen Dwight are you the only one
remembers and you found it yes
sir nobody remembers that it's on the
north side of our
building you remember it yeah centuy I
guess is probably what it was but that's
witchcraft it was to curse
us before we ever built just before we
built suppos to be
yeah might have been cuz we got in the
building I don't think the devil got us
in this
building my point is simply this it's
not make believe people really believe
this stuff and they really engage in it
but as bad as that is and we should stay
as far away from that as the East is
from the West go back to what it really
is about and stay as far away from this
stuff as the East is from the w West
don't rebel against God don't get
involved in seduction and immorality
don't get involved in killing a baby
don't get involved in superstitious
events and don't get involved in
anything that would be treasonous or the
basics of what God would call you to do
amen amen so remember thatth we're still
here whatever any devil might want to
pull we serve God and if you're here
tonight you've not given your life to
serve the Lord I want to give you that
opportunity to repent of your sins
confess the name of Christ be baptized
become his child and then Satan's got no
hold on you
