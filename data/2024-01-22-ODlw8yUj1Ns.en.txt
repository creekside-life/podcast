so where are we
heading now I've lived in Florida for 4
years and I know that that word
limit is spelled
incorrectly that actually means
suggestion that is a guideline a speed
guideline I know that if I'm doing 85 I
am going
slow because my wife reminds me that I'm
going slow
good old
Florida yeah one that I love about
Florida most of you probably don't
recognize that it's a turn
signal uh in Australia we call it an
indicator and as you can see the uh the
turn signal stick hasn't been used in a
while I'm sure we all have that in our
vehicles correct drives me wild because
you know what when I get to a four-way
stop I I end up doing doing this dance
with someone because cuz I don't know
where they're going and then at the last
minute they turn across because hey I'm
going this way like I I just I read your
mind yeah it was
great this drives me wild
right but us as Christians we need to we
need to have some sort of indication of
where we're going we need to show the
world where we're heading so I thought
this is kind of an interesting idea of
of how we live but also so how are we as
a congregation showing the community
around us where are we going where are
we heading who are
We There are some scriptures that keep
me
awake and it's going to be quite
interesting for me to describe this but
Ephesians chapter
2:10 is a scripture that I am terrified
of Ephesians 2:10 let me read it for we
are God's
handiwork created in Christ Jesus to do
good
works which God prepared in advance for
us to do now you think Keegan why would
that frighten
you that terrifies me that scripture wow
I think I just shouted at you guys
sorry that scripture keeps me awake at
night because I am I God's handiwork I
am made for good
works and that tells me I have
potential and church I I'm terrified
that I'm not living up to my
potential I'll qu a weird thing that I
saw on the internet but this uh Doctor
Surgeon his name is Richard Leah he uh
he writes in his book about uh his
experience in humanus hospital where
they were operating on a
creature an alien they say and
apparently the alien woke up during this
procedure and
said I feel sorry for you humans you
have so much
potential if only you knew who you
are now you may not believe that story
I'm not sure I believe that story but
the sentiment of what he's
saying is what I'm talking about
here we have so much potential
am I am I living up to what God has set
before me am I waking up every morning
with intention to do what he's asked me
to do with intention of what he designed
me to
do I'm terrified to stand before God not
because I'm scared of his wrath I'm
scared of disappointing my
father and I think about Revelation 3:16
so because you are lukewarm neither hot
nor cold I am about to to spit you out
of my
mouth you ever had a hot cup of tea it's
nice you ever had a cold glass of tea
yeah it's nice you ever had lukewarm
tea I spit you out my mouth choose
one I'm terrified of these scriptures
Church another one that I want to talk
about today is Matthew chap
25:14
if you want to turn with me to that one
and as we go through the scripture today
I I ask you to think about uh how does
this scripture apply to us
spiritually how does this scripture
apply to me
mentally how does it apply to me
physically how does it apply to my my
relationship with
God I want you to think about how does
this apply to us as a
congregation and then most importantly
how does this apply to you as an
individual have these discussions with
yourselves as we go through this Matthew
chapter 25 verse
14
again some some versions say uh the
kingdom of heaven will be like a man
going on a journey who called his
servants and entrusted his property to
them to one he gave five talents of
money and another two talents and to
another one Talent each according to his
ability then he went on his journey I
want to stop there that first part there
the Kingdom of Heaven is like or will be
like church when Jesus says the Kingdom
of Heaven is
like pay attention I want to know what
it's like and so Jesus is speaking here
and he starts off like that right and so
he begins to tell this story tell this
parable and what I want to highlight is
the
talent what is a talent there right a
talent is not oh well I'm talented
playing a sport or we're talking about a
a a sum of money here a weighty sum now
some
Scholars go backwards and forwards but
it's about 6,000 dinari they reckon and
then barlay barlay he was talking about
it being roughly about 20 years of their
servants wage some some Scholars say one
year they go backwards and forwards
because they don't know what kind of
material was actually being used there
gold silver or bronze but what it
emphasizes is a weighty
measure I've been these men have been
given something that is of
value and so the story
continues the man who had received the
five talents went at once and put his
money to work gained five more so also
the one with the two talents gained two
more but the man who had received the
one Talent went off dug a hole in the
ground and hid his master's
money I love that the man with the five
and the two talents it says the man who
had received the five turns went at once
he went at once this idea that as soon
as he got it he started
working he started
working and so this idea that good
servants feel the responsibility of
their assignments and went to work
without delay he worked promptly with
perseverance in church when I when I'm
working promptly when I'm working with
perseverance I'm ready to give an
account for what I'm
doing so these guys must have had pride
in what they were doing they they had
pride in their work but there's an
underline principle here as well
that
we we making our Capital work for us
right you use your capital and you
diligently and prudently make it start
to work for you and this is what's
happening the master is giving his his
money to his servant
and he's entrusting them because it says
according to their ability so he knows
his servants well enough to give them
this weighty measure knowing that they
will do good with
it and so off they go and work and so
the Master's asking them to diligently
work to to um grow the resources
wisely um and uh to be productive and
fruitful
this is what's un loan to
them they are not the owners of this
this
Talent it's on loan to
them from the
master right this this idea of Christian
stewardship comes
out uh
oronia the Greek word e economics uh
meaning a house of rule or a house law
we draw this word stewardship from this
word
ainia right and uh this idea that we
have to be diligent students with
whatever we are given from
God now could be finances it could be
abilities could be uh could be a lot of
things whatever is given to us from God
we have to be good stewards of this
right
what I find with uh some Christian
circles
nowadays is that there's this idea that
we we just have to have a loving heart
we just have to be kind we just have to
be
okay but you read the scriptures what I
don't understand is how do you not see
that God is calling us to be fruitful to
be productive to be good student is with
what he's given us not just to sit back
and go yeah cool we love Jesus let's be
a
fan a tree doesn't bring forth fruits
it's a tree that doesn't bring bring
forth fruits is only worthy of being cut
down and cast Into the Fire by their
fruits you shall know them not by their
words but by the stewardship of the
faith that they profess to
have it is important to equip the Saints
for
Ministry every Christian needs to
participate in the work of the
church you may not be an Evangelist
Church you may not uh be a a speaker or
or someone who who can easily do those
kinds of things but it's also your
responsibility to make sure the church
is
evangelizing you have a responsibility
as an individual to make sure the church
is doing what God has asked us to do all
right there's no room for Slackers in
the kingdom of
God not working not producing is not
Christianity we are all gifted by the
holy spirit for
Ministry and at the time the master
returns he will have an accounting with
us so how would you feel this morning if
Jesus was to to come
back
are you ready to give an
account CU I'm
terrified have I led up to my potential
have I been a good Steward with what
he's given
me have we as a church being a good
Steward with what God has given
us are we ready to give an account
church and so The Story Goes On
verse 19 after a long time the master of
those servants returned and settled
accounts with them the man who had
received the five talents brought the
other five Master he said you entrusted
me with five talents see I have gained
five
more his master replied well done good
and faithful servant you have been
faithful with a few things I will put
you in charge of many things come and
share your Master's happiness notice
what he says you good and faithful
servant he doesn't say you good and you
good and prudent you good and
faithful loyal you you're
obedient you good and faithful servant
I'd love to hear those words from Christ
one day well done Keegan come on
in the next one uh verse 20 uh sorry
verse 22 the man with two talents came
also came Master he saided me talent I
have gained two more and his master
replied well done good and faithful
servant you have been faithful with a
few things I will put you in charge of
many things come and share your Master's
happiness now notice it's not about the
the amount that they made because the
one has five the other one has two what
it's about is being good and
faithful and they will put in charge of
more stuff now what given more yes
because if we're good and faithful and
shown to be
responsible maybe that's what's going to
happen in heaven maybe we'll be put in
charge of a few things I don't
know but maybe there's responsibilities
that
are that are needed to be fulfilled and
God needs to trust someone God needs
someone who is good and faithful are we
that church are we that
individual I'd love to hear those words
good and faithful
servant in verse
24 then the man who had received the one
Talent came Master he said I knew that
you were a hard
man harvesting where you have not sown
and Gathering where you have not
scattered seed so I was afraid and went
out and hid your talent in the ground
see here is what belongs to you okay I
find this fascinating that this man
starts this off this way I I knew you
reaped where you didn't SE what did that
even
mean this idea that the servant knows
how powerful his master is
you are so powerful
omnipotent did you reap or you don't
even
sow
wow what an excuse that one is God you
are so
powerful I didn't really think I needed
to work because what am I going to do so
I'm just going to give this straight
back to you because you're in charge
you're all powerful and
that's a good excuse right Church we're
going to stand before Christ one day in
Judgment Day and give an account like
that Jesus you were just so powerful I
know you said go and preach the word to
to the world spread the gospel but you
know you're really the one who should be
doing that because you have all the
power and and you reap what you not SE
and and all those kinds of things I'm
just you know I'm just going
to return this
how do you think that is going to play
out for
us well let's see how this plays
out verse 26 his master
replied you Wicked lazy
servant you knew that I harvest where I
have not swn and gather where I have not
scattered seed well then you should have
put my money on deposit with Bankers so
that when I returned I would have
received it back with
interest take the talent from him and
give it to the one who has the 10
talents for everyone who has will be
given more and he will have an abundance
whoever does not have even what he has
will be taken from him and throw that
worthless servant
outside into the
darkness where there will be weeping and
nashing of teeth
I don't want to be that
servant so how do I look at this
scripture how do I look at this as a a
congregation and as an
individual that third servant didn't
even
try I mean he could have taken his money
to the bank could have tried something
could have got a little bit interest for
it at least at least I got something at
least we tried he didn't even do
that he buried it
away and the response is you Wicked and
lazy Servant Church I am terrified that
the days where I'm sitting at home and I
could rather be reading my Bible and
I'll rather watch a TV show or a a
YouTube or
something you know what I'm talking
about we make those decisions where we
have this opportunity to be get closer
to
God and we choose the other
one
lazy or how about coming to church on on
a Sunday
evening are we choosing other things
what about Wednesday nights when the
when the the group
meets are we choosing other
things I'm terrified at these scriptures
church I'm Terri
verified there are many scriptures on
stewardship uh I mean Genesis 1 when
we're giving stewardship of the earth 1
Peter 4:10 as each has received a gift
use it to serve another as good stewards
of God's very Grace Colossians
3:23 whatever you do work
heartily as for the Lord and not for
man 1 Corinthians
6:20 for you were bought with a price so
glorify God in your body church we have
a
responsibility we are called to share
the
gospel do we even know what the gospel
is we must be good stewards not only
with our finances not only with our
minds not only with our
bodies Our Time good stewards of our
time
I know I fail on that
one but we are supposed to be good
stewards faithfully and diligently
sharing the
gospel how many of us did that this
week
so I know this seems a little bit hard
this sermon but this is where this takes
us what I wanted to share with you today
is this Church's
vision
because I wanted to let you know we are
not just sitting by idly we are not just
burying what God has given us in the
ground we are trying
something amen church I'm I am so proud
to be part of this church people ask me
what we doing I'm like we're doing
something we're trying because when we
go door knocking that doesn't work in
most places it's illegal now that's fun
this is America you can get sh
yeah we tried
tracting has anybody been out tracking
you know what I mean by tracting handy
out flyers has anybody been putting
those in mailboxes before yeah I've done
a lot of that work how many times have
you been shouted out by someone don't
put junk mail in my my my mailbox yep so
many times and I'm like it's not junk
mail it's the gospel
and then yeah I got in trouble we
actually got hate mail at our previous
Congregation of we need to stop doing
those kinds of things so we can't track
anymore we uh radios are
syndicated so how do we how do we preach
the gospel and I'm not just talking to
the world I'm talking about to our local
community how do we do that because
gospel meetings remember when gospel
meetings went for like 2
weeks and people would show up and we'd
have I remember down in South Africa we
had like like 5 600 people show up at a
a lectur ship it was amazing and would
go for a week and people would be
there if we had a gospel meeting now
maybe two days most people aren't going
to be here let's be honest and how do we
get the community to come in here about
Jesus in May 2023 ABC news reports uh
according to the Hillsboro County 25 to
30,000 people use Lithia Pine Crest
every day this road out
here now I know this because when I try
and turn out of the office every
day as I start my
car there's no one on
Lithia and as soon as I pull up to the
road the Hall of temper
arrives I'm I'm pretty sure they all
like round by Fish Hawk and everyone's
like wait hold he's coming wait okay go
go go go and it takes me about 30
minutes before I can pull into traffic
and I'm going the same direction right
we have an opportunity here Church 25 to
30,000 people driving past every
day we have an opportunity to share the
gospel with those
people and so for many years there's
been discussions diligently prudently
planned about how can we share the
gospel in an environment where it's
really tricky to do how do we build this
community
up and
share The Wonderful Life of Christ that
we love so much how do we share that and
transform other people's lives so we're
in the first building phase one this is
the gymnasium so if you're looking at
the
screen top right that's where we're
sitting right now top right to the left
of that is going to be the auditorium
it's going to house about 850 people all
right then to the left of that that that
building that kind of looks like a
question mark I thought that was kind of
funny you guys see it yep is going to be
the Learning Center and then right
across the field there is the
benevolence SL the
offices
so how do we use this asset based
resource that God has blessed us with
how are we good stewards with
this now I want to start by saying our
goal is not to be a mega church I've
heard Rumblings around that we're trying
to be in mega church not the
case we are simply trying to share the
gospel through an asset-based
resource we're trying something
different we're trying something new
we're stepping out in faith we're taking
a risk like the guy with five talents
and two talents took a risk they tried
something and I cannot I it's such a
relief to
me that we are actually trying to do
something because when we stand before
God I can say God we tried we're
trying and I pray that I hear well done
you're good and faithful servant
so we're in this uh
gymnasium it's going to be a basketball
court at some
point basketball Ministry Harrison Cowan
cannot stop talking to me about having a
basketball ministry here at the
building he is doing some wonderful work
with the kids I don't know where he he
somewhere there he is at the back he's
doing some wonderful work with the kids
at FCA he's having some really good
discussions about Christ and he wants to
he wants to grow that through basketball
and we're going to provide the the
facility for him to do
that
awesome but it can't just fall on
him it's got to we need help someone
needs to come and ref the games right is
that right reing or umpiring I don't
know basketball is a weird game
man but that's going to be a Ministry
what about uh a volleyball
tournament let's have some volleyball
players here and let's talk to them
about
Christ let's have banners up talking
about worshiping serving sharing
transforming hey we start at 9:00 a.m.
on
Sunday maybe we have some people that
are here to talk about
that uh what about a we want to share
this with FCA and and have them have
some volleyball tournaments here or
basketball tournaments here we're going
to help them out too uh yesterday
actually we had a martial arts Awards
day here yesterday right here there were
kids breaking boards with their
foreheads over here I mean little kids
it was
awesome right right
here we had 200 plus of the
community that were sitting in these
seats yesterday and I was sitting and I
was listening and they were coming and
going wow this is a cool Church heard a
lot of people say
that we want more of events like that
happening here and we need more
people church
members that can help that can talk to
people about Christ we're creating an
environment where we can talk about
Christ and not have a door slammed in
our
face free
clinics um I know some doctors said
doctors have said they want to do some
free clinics for us that'll bring some
people in cricket Ministry I'm excited
about this one there's a cricket
Community North of Tampa about 300
people I'm going to host a cricket
tournament in this building and it's
going to be awesome and I'm going to
bring 300 people down I want to talk
about Christ with them I want to pray
before the games I want them to know who
we belong
to uh conferences uh lectur ships uh the
the auditorium to the left doubles up
can double up as a local
theater so now we can have local theater
I've reached out to some people who
write plays about Ruth and Esther and
and biblical plays and they they love
this idea they want to give us their
materials for
free because they love what we're trying
to do here we're trying to create an
environment that is Christ um situated
it's
uh we want to create a vibrant and
welcoming christian christian community
at Creekside Church of Christ where
people can grow in their faith and
engage with the world around them we're
going to have a benevolence uh office
where people can come get some stuff uh
we're going to have appreciation events
imagine imagine inviting the sheriff's
down here and we can serve them a meal
and say thank you for what you do what
about the EMTs let's invite them down
here for a lunch thank you for what you
do we're the Church of Christ have you
heard about
Jesus
coffee shop we going to have a coffee
shop in the
auditorium no I love this idea why
because coffee shop because FCA is next
door parents when you drop your kids off
keep coming
around just just drive around just come
have a free coffee on
us cuz I'm probably going to be there or
Rex I know Rex wants to be there we want
to be doing Bible studies how about we
just read the Bible Bible for an hour
come get a free
coffee just come around we want to serve
you there's so many good ideas with what
we're doing here um I really love that
we're trying something we're stepping
out in faith uh a car show I actually I
I ran into a guy who used to be a pastor
at some mega church thing and anyway we
got chatting and I was picking his brain
and he said you know what car shows
brought so many people
so I'm like okay I don't know I'm not a
big car person but hey let's do a car
show let's do a boat show you see how
big this door is at the back we can
squeeze it we can squeeze a boat in
there's so much we can do Church uh we
have ideas of having a prayer walk from
FCA all the way around imagine having a
prayer walk you can come on a Tuesday
morning or wherever it might be have a
coffee go for a walk and and every so
often there's a a plaque with a a
scripture on you can stop think about
your lord and
pray church I can go on and on and on
and on and on about this stuff I am
really excited that we are trying
something I am really excited that God
has blessed us with these resources
clearly he sees
us with an ability that we have some
sort of ability that God has said here
you go Creekside do something with
it now church this is what we can do as
a a group I am excited where we're
heading but as individuals how do we all
play a part in this wonderful project
because God's called us as individuals
to share the
gospel so we need you
too it behooves us all to get involved
in this to see the vision continue the
vision and fight for this Vision because
church this is not going to be easy it's
going to take time Satan does not like
what we're
doing it's we've seen a lot of that
already there's a lot of uh a lot of
things we're still trying to navigate
how do we sign up put up contracts how
do we uh you know ensure our insurances
there's a lot of those things that we're
dealing with right now we're learning as
we go but we don't want to stop we want
this to keep going we want to share what
Christ has done with this community and
we think this is the best way forward
church I love this I really hope this
excites you it excites
me that's the lesson
today I know we all lead busy
lives I know it's easy for us to put God
second let's not be lazy
Church let's get stuck in let's get
working let's do what God has asked us
to do if you need Christ we all need
Christ but if you have been lazy if you
want to make a change today is a good
day to do that you can come
forward we can we can help you make
things right and and you know what we
have jobs coming you can be busy busy
busy I promise you yeah I don't stop
with this stuff we have lots to do
Church the work is the Harvest is
many if you need Christ come forward as
we stand and as we
sing
