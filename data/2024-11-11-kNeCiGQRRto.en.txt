preacher was preaching a lesson on uh
loving your enemies at this congregation
and loving them and forgiving them and
uh roused his congregation to change and
he says well he actually asked for a
response from the congregation he says
well who will go out and love their
enemies and every hand in the whole
congregation went up except one little
old lady that he knew real well and he
said well uh why can't you love your
enemy sister and he said well she said
well preacher I can honestly say I have
no
enemies and the preacher said well
that's
incredible um may I ask how old you are
and she said I'm
96 he said you're 96 years old that's
amazing and you have no enemies could
you please share with us how it is that
you've been able to achieve that at
966 and she said well I've outlived all
those
snakes there's certain truth to that I
suppose you can outlive them you know
the United
States are not always as United as we
wish they were I think we know that
right now right uh political
disagreement kind of plagues us
suspicion plagues the country judgment
hatred uh neighbors are not seen as
friends sometimes they're seen as
enemies
it's not supposed to be that way amen
not supposed to
be uh Nanette sawer in her book
Hospitality the sacred art said this she
asked this question how can we love in
the face of
hatred how can we prepare ourselves for
and then Implement
Hospitality in the presence of
hostility how is it possible to hold
receptivity and reverence generosity
toward those who hold enmity toward us
and then she proceeded immediately to
answer that question she said preparing
to respond to such hostility begins from
our
Center and it's a shift we shift our
Focus from our vulnerabil
vulnerability in the face of others to
realize instead our own power to act as
proactive na Neighbors in all of our
encounters you aren't
stuck you can do different that's her
point you have the power to
change there's a name here I don't know
if I'm going to do any justice to it
you'll understand in a minute his name
was Su
suto
suopo and his wife's name was cartini
supro and cartini were javanes
do you know that Javanese Christians who
moved into a neighborhood in
Jakarta and all the other residents
where they moved to now you they did
this for a reason that all the other
residents were uh
Indonesian and islamists everybody in
their
neighborhood but they wanted to become
friends with their neighbors and cortini
the wife baked cakes for their neighbors
and all their neighbors were islamist in
that area and they proceeded to rebuke
them for trying to win them over and all
the cakes were thrown into the
garbage and they were
dismissed uh it was pretty soft spoken
spoken family unassuming man he told his
story in a small Church about how he was
hesitant to do anything really he relate
related to them how each Sunday morning
he and his wife and their children would
get up walk out of the neighborhood
carrying their Bibles on their way to
worship and men from the neighborhood
would often follow them threatening them
and insulting them with shouts of
disdain and standing together threaten
thre in to block their way so they
couldn't even make it to
church but they kept going and they kept
trying to be friends with their
neighbors over time the thoughts and
tensions
faded and even though friendship was
elusive it began to develop supro or
however you say his name and cartini
contined to act neighborly toward them
and believe it or not some something
began to happen after 4 years of all the
insults suddenly things began to change
they had several friends in the
neighborhood and often neighbors came to
their house for advice began to realize
this was a family that seemed to know
what was going on and how life should be
they had asked advice about marriage or
help with their children and how to
raise their children because they
noticed how good their children were in
the words of the Javanese the Javanese
Miracle Worker they joined with us this
is what he said they joined with us so
he's saying that they changed they
joined with us to patch our leaky roof
during rainy season they delivered
greeting cards whenever we celebrated
our sacred holidays they invite our
Christian children into their Muslim
homes and they bring us
cakes so maybe you can
breakr penos lapida who is a Jewish
Orthodox teacher wrote this about this
subject love of one's enemies as Jesus
understood it means far more than
covering things up with a smile by
tolerating enemies or holding them at a
distance with politeness it entails an
honest effort a campaigning and
struggling with them so that they change
change give up their hate and become
reconciled in short a
theopolitics of little loving steps
aimed at making the enemy cease to be an
enemy that's how you end a
war you make an
enemy not an
enemy when we do kind Deeds for enemies
we never know how crucial it
is I don't think we recognize it
sometimes
Exodus 23:4 here's some threats to us
almost about how we treat people who
don't particularly care for us if you
meet your enemy's ox or his donkey going
astray so you just out walking through
the forest and you come upon the guy who
doesn't like you or the woman who
doesn't like you is their ox or their
donkey who's going as stray you shall
surely bring it back to him
again would he do it for you probably
probably not but you do it Psalm
7:4 if I have repaid evil to him who was
at peace with me that's a terrible thing
to do isn't it to be mean to someone
who's been good to you or have plundered
my enemy without
cause wait a minute I thought he an
enemy you have cause no just because
somebody does like you doesn't give you
the right to hurt them proverbs 24:17
do not rejoice when your enemy
Falls that's a hard one isin't
it Proverbs 25: 21 and 22 if your enemy
is hungry give him bread if he's thirsty
give him water and the Lord will reward
you because that's different than the
way the world tends to
do there were many enemies of God's
people throughout the history of the
Bible and you probably know this but
have you ever noticed how God found a
way to love all those enemies so I want
to just walk you through it just a
second so that you'll pay attention to
at least a few of them Saul was David's
enemy do you remember that actually
tried to kill him tried to pin him
against the wall with a javelin one time
and he tried to catch him in battle he
tried to catch him in the field yet
David was the one that God used to show
love to Saul that was God that wasn't
David as much as it was God using David
to show love to Saul to show him love
and care and sidan was Israel's
enemy yet it was God through Elijah that
found a way to show a little love in
siden by taking care of a
widow loving her and feeding her and her
son in a
town that not only hates hated him but
hated people of Israel syrians were
Israel's enemy yet God through
Elisha found a way to show the syrians a
Little
Love by taking care of a commander named
naamon and healing him and sending him
back home with a pile of dirt that he
could kneel on since he couldn't be in
Israel and pray to God
sakra uh was the king of Assyria or
whatever they call him there he and
their Capital was Nineveh and it was a
grave enemy of Israel yet God through
Jonah found a way to show Nineveh Love
by preaching through Jonah to ninev and
saving them now what I need you to see
in all those little examples cuz she
just kind of went through that really
quick what I want you to see is here's
what you do for your enemies you're
going to do them
good you're not going to give them what
they want sorry enemies don't get what
they
want you give them what they
need if you give them what they want
you'd have to leave probably or move or
whatever or die you know that's the way
they'd think right but that's not what
you give them you give them what they
need so walk you through a few examples
of that with Jesus because I think it's
important to notice how that was done
over and over again in the life of Jesus
so we'll walk through that number one
Samaritans behaved as an enemy to Jesus
but he found a way to show love to the
Samaritans the Jews didn't like them and
the Samaritans didn't like the Jews and
don't you look at how the Samaritans
kind of behaved as an enemy even to
Jesus personally in Luke 9 51-56 six he
was on his way to Jerusalem and he made
up his mind he go through Jerusalem well
uh he wanted to pass through Samaria but
when they heard that he was headed to
Jerusalem they wouldn't receive
him wouldn't have anything to do with
him in John chapter 4:9 we learn that
the Jews and the Samaritans had no
dealings with each other that basically
means they weren't friends it was more
than that though they didn't do business
with each other they really kind of
ignored each
other that's an
enemy if you got anybody at church that
won't speak to you you ought to make
them speak to you amen just make them
speak to you um make them deal with you
and how Jesus loved his enemy how did
Jesus love this enemy called the
Samaritans in John 4:
39-40 uh the Samaritan woman you
remember that he stops he's hungry but
he stops and spends time talking to her
anyway even though she's shocked that
he's speaking to her absolutely shocked
tells all these things about her trying
to draw her in and and does a good job
makes her a Believer out of her but then
he turns around what's really great is
she goes and talks to everybody about
this guy this Jew that seems to be maybe
the Messiah and they come and he
preaches to them and they
believe why was Jesus worrying about
them CU he loved
them in Luke chapter 10 we all know this
story verses 30 through 37 it's the
story of the Good Samaritan right we all
know the story about this man that's
robbed beaten left half dead and naked
in the side of the road and the priest
of levite walk by don't do anything but
the one guy who does do something Jesus
this is a parable right might have been
a true story but we know definitely we
we regard it as a parable it was a
Samaritan that stopped to help the Jew
who' been beaten up he made the hero a
Samaritan now imagine what that did to
any Samaritans that might have heard
this
story so Samaritans behaved as an enemy
but Jesus tried and and succeeded at
finding a way to show a little love to
them there's a message in that I think
don't you
think but what about this one
Peter you may not realize it but Peter
behaved at times as an enemy to Jesus
Jesus found a way to show him love even
when that was going
on how did Peter behave as an enemy well
Matthew 16:
21-23 Jesus he just identified Jesus
you're the Christ the son of the Living
God we all know that text right but then
Jesus begins to explain how he's going
to be beaten uh scourged and he's going
to be crucified in Jerusalem
and Peter uhuh see that's so opposed to
their theology because their theology
was good things happen to good people
and bad things happen to bad people so
this couldn't happen to you so he takes
him aside rebukes him for having even
said such a thing as that you shouldn't
even talk that
way and J Jesus tells him get behind me
Satan yeah you're being like an enemy to
me right now you don't love the things
of God you love the things of man
in Matthew 26:
69-72 Peter is the one who promised I'll
die for you once he do he denies that he
knows him he denies that he knows him
then he swears and takes an oath and
says I don't know the
man and when you do that you're
basically saying if I'm telling the lie
I'm going to go to hell
that's quite a statement that's not
really like a friend is it imagine your
best friend telling other people I don't
know who in the world that is I don't
know how Jesus loved his enemy this is
Peter and Luke 22:
31-32 uh Satan said to Jesus at some
point in that process give Peter to
me I I'll take
him he's not as tough as he thinks or
everybody thinks he is I'll sift him as
sweet you'll see what he's really made
out
of and Jesus said but I prayed for
you and when you recover strengthen your
brethren so Jesus prayed for him
particularly over that matter that's
what you do for people you love right
you pray for them praying for each other
is
what you do even if they act like an
enemy even if they act like an enemy and
John 21: 15-19 Peter do you love me this
is after Jesus rose from the dead Peter
do you love me we know I love you Lord
Peter do you love me you know I love you
Lord
Peter do you love
me you see that's a tough thing to say
in a way because it was what he needed
not what he wanted you back to the point
you know you need to give people what
they need not necessarily what they want
at that moment and then he talks to him
about his death about how he's going to
grow old and be taking places that he
doesn't want to go and be bound by them
to go there but Peter acted at times and
behaved as an enemy at times but Jesus
found a way even when a man does that
even a good man can act as your enemy
and when that happens you treat him as a
friend anyway and you love them just the
same how about Judas wait a minute now
that's an enemy well not yeah I know
Judas behaved as an enemy to Jesus but
Jesus found a way to show love even to
Judas Judas behaved as an enemy in John
12: 4-8 Judas complained about Mary's
perfume right breaking that box and
pouring it out what a waste that should
have been used we could have sold it
taking care of a lot of poor people cuz
you know Poor People's What Judas really
cared about and he was the number one
poor person he cared about cuz he kept
the bag and he used to take from it
so he didn't really
care you know he was just throwing barbs
in Matthew 26: 14-16 Judas made a
deal for 30 pieces of silver to look for
a time to betray Jesus now can you
imagine one of your friends literally
making a deal to do you
in could you imagine an enemy doing that
yeah you could imagine it this was
supposed to be one of his friends
right right so how did Jesus show love
to Judas who behaved as an enemy in Luke
16:
19-31 this Parable and anyways should
have been a warning to
Judas because Judas was struggling to
believe that Jesus was the Messiah he
was struggling to believe that Lazarus
was raised from the dead you know nobody
will believe unless one rises from the
dead then they'll
believe but Judas was at that meal when
he was complaining about the the waste
and Lazarus was sitting right there and
he's struggling
but Jesus is telling that story because
he knew that needed to be a story he
needed to hear in Matthew 26:
47-50 he kissed
Judas when Judas came to betray him
Jesus didn't slap him Jesus didn't hurt
him he kissed it greeted him with a
kiss that's not too bad that's almost
sounds like love doesn't it just almost
s that love in John 13: 10 and 11 and
then veres 21- 27 we learn that Jesus
the night in which he was betrayed by
Judas this is about to happen within
minutes or hours of this happening
right Jesus is washing the disciples
feet and Judas was
there and you remember how Peter says
you'll not wash my feet and he says I
won't wash everybody's feet or you're
not a part of what I'm doing and Peter
gave in so that means he had to have
washed judas's
feet but more than that he didn't tell
anybody Jesus didn't tell anybody he
didn't tell on him don't say you know
the one I know he is even when he tells
who did it he doesn't tell him who did
it and he basically tells him uh what
have you going to do do it quickly
everybody interpreted this just go this
stuff we got to have for the
feast but no Jesus is even loving him
there there giving him what he really
needed even though he didn't respond to
it not necessarily what he wanted so
Judas behaved as an enemy but Jesus
found a way to love him anyway here's
the real stickler how about this
one how about this one have you ever
noticed
this see Satan behaves as an enemy he is
the great accuser of the Brethren he
behaves as an enemy to Jesus and to us
but Jesus found a way to even show love
I mean I'm telling you the father has
shown
ways to love even
Satan what well Satan behaved as an
enemy you know that all the way back
every time you read of him he's looking
for something against one of
us right he's not your friend is
he has no desire to help you
out he will steal kill and destroy right
I've got a ton of scripture here what he
did with job oh no he had no desire for
job to come through this fine he wanted
job to fall flat of his face
absolutely no desire for him to do well
that's how he behaves that's how he
behaves every turn we go I mean we going
to talk in just a minute just a little
bit more about Matthew 4 about him
coming wanting to tear te Our Savior
down and the Holy Spirit drives Jesus
Into the Wilderness to allow it to be
tried you got that
right lead us not into temptation is a
real reason to pray
that because the Holy Spirit led him in
the wilderness to be tempted of the
devil
now how does Jesus love his
enemy what you will see if you go
through the scriptures that I've got up
there as how the devil is treated with
respect in the story of job he's treated
like a Son of
God no Harm's done to him he's talked to
with respect the angels are careful how
they speak to him have you noticed you
don't they don't bring railing
accusations against the
devil he said well he deserves
it but if you
love you don't do
that are you hearing
it that's the
devil here's what happened
if you really pay attention Jesus
treated Satan respectfully while he's
being
tempted so the first temptation is he
Jesus answers this temptation to turn
stones into the bread right he says no
to seeking self-c
consolation by perverting a holy
position my position this is Jesus my
position it's not just to take care of
me that's not what I'm here
about it's not just about bread it's not
about consoling me you missed the
point then he temps it with jumping off
the Pinnacle of the
temple and Jesus says no to seeking
self-affirmation by perverting a holy
promise well God we all know s
91 that's what it
says but Jesus won't do that he's still
not being
disrespectful to him and then of course
he he says well if you'll just kneel
down I'll give you everything you want
right now you be the king of kings Lord
of lords right now of this whole planet
you want it you can have it right now
I'll make by the way he could give it to
him there's the type of King he could
have been over the whole world and Satan
delivers by the way people you can make
a deal with the devil people do it all
the time you don't think that happens
you're naive if you think you can't make
it you make a deal with God you make a
deal with the devil I'm telling you
straight up it can happen and God will
fulfill his end you better fulfill your
end if you do that kind of thing I going
tell you something Satan will do the
same thing you be careful what you say
and what you think you're getting done
cuz that will happen that's not a safe
path but it could have happened and this
is proof that it can be done so if you
doubt the fact that you could make a
deal with the Devil you doubt this story
because that's exactly what was going
down is the deal with the devil was
being made or at least he was attempting
it oh yeah they can happen otherwise
there's no temptation but he says no to
seeking self glorification by perverting
a holy priority a holy priority is God's
honor God's glory worship of
God but even in all of that he's treated
with
difference not what
wants but what he
needs so Satan behaves as an enemy as an
accuser but Jesus found a way to love
him anyway that's how God's love God's
love all the time folks so love your
enemies say look at this just a
second the Samaritans behaved like
enemies and the Jews treated them like
enemies but the Lord found a way to love
them anyway Peter behaved as an enemy
for a moment but the Lord found a way to
show him love anyway Judas behaved as an
enemy for sure but the Lord found a way
to treat him with love anyway Satan
behaves as an enemy by the way it's not
your place I know you've probably
listened to a lot of Pentecostal
churches out there I bind Satan I bind
you Satan you ain't got no business
talking like
that it's not your place don't you be
talking like that you got no authority
to talk like that zero nobody's told you
to do that not even the angels of heaven
talk like that you be careful he's been
around a long time don't get me wrong I
ain't got nothing for the devil okay but
he's got he's got a position way above
the position that the average Dee on the
planet has I assure you and they're far
more powerful than we are and no stuff
we've never even heard about be careful
what you
say show there no
difference from the stories after the
release from the prison camp at the
bridge over the river qu y'all remember
the bridge over the river Qui comes
Bruce
Howell Bruce Howell writes a little
story that you probably have never heard
before so I want you think it is this is
not after they're back with the uh
Americans per se but just listen to what
happens Bruce Howell says we found
ourselves on the same track with several
carloads of Japanese wounded after we
were freed from the Quai prison camp
these unfortunat These are Japanese
wounded you hear me it's not American
wounded we found ourselves on the same
track with several carloads of Japanese
wounded after we were freed from the
Quai prison camp these unfortunates were
on their own without medical
care no no longer fit for Action in
Burma they had been packed into Railway
cars which were being returned to
Bangkok they were in a shocking State I
have never seen men
filthier uniforms were encrusted with
mud blood and
excrement their wounds sorely inflamed
and full of pus crawled with maggots
the maggots however in eating the
putrified flesh probably prevented gain
grain it was apparently why the Japanese
were so cruel to their
prisoners if they didn't care for their
own why should they care for
us the wounded looked at us
forlorn as they sat with their heads
resting against the carriages waiting
for
death they had been discarded as
Expendables the refuges of
War these were the
enemy they were more cowed and defeated
than we had ever
been without a
word
sorry without a word most of the
officers in my section unbuckled their
packs took out part of their R ration
and a rag or two and with water cantens
in their hands went over to the Japanese
train our guards tried to prevent us
balling no GAA no
gka but we ignored them and knelt down
by the enemy to give water and food to
clean and bind up their
wounds grateful cries of arato
thank you followed us when we
left I regarded my comrades with
Wonder let us out
love let us out
kind let us out forgive anyone who would
think to be an
enemy pray for them
them offer a
smile give a peaceful
gesture hold the door
open anonymously help with the
task leave a gift where they might find
it for we were
once the enemy of our Lord
Jesus and while we were enemies he still
died for
us Romans 5 and verse
8 if the Lord conf finded in his heart
to love this
enemy and pull me and
you out and make us realize what we're
messing up by being his enemy maybe we
can do it for others
amen maybe we can love our enemies and
the way you love your enemy is you turn
your enemy into a
friend wouldn't it be great if all the
war ceased all the conflicts went away
because people refus to kill anymore and
they just decided to try to find a way
to love anybody and everybody follow
Jesus and love your enemies if you're
here tonight you've never repented of
your sins confess the name of Christ I
want to tell you something we're in the
30s right now I don't actually know what
the actual number is I'm sure Allison
probably knows it I don't and somewhere
in the neighborhood of about 35 36 37
baptisms we've had since we started in
this building about a year and a half
ago God's blessing us that's a good
thing but you know the rest of us who've
been baptized already at some point we
got to grow up
too and loving your
enemies is a way to grow up
