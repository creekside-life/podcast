Israel
did not know what they had.
Do you?
Israel did not know God's love
and did not ex expect at all the gift of
the love that came to him in the
expression of Jesus.
Jesus was sent
for God so loved the world that he gave
his only son. John 3:16 and 17. He was
not sent into the world to condemn the
world.
That already was true.
He came to save it. Jesus
was not meant to be at that time in any
sense an earthly king. He was meant to
be a spiritual king of a spiritual
kingdom. John 18:36.
What they wanted was a repeat except in
grandness.
They wanted another king, David.
A religious guy, but not too religious.
Because David was a religious guy, but
not too religious.
He's still quite secular. He was a psalm
writer and he made fe people feel good.
And he was a king. He's the kind of guy
that could handle your Goliaths. And
they had Goliath called Rome.
They wanted a king to fight for them, to
give them prosperity.
They wanted freedom, which by the way
proves that you can have a dictatorship
and still have freedom.
They wanted a king
to give them a country that they could
be proud of, that they could do about
what they want, that they would be very
wealthy, that they would have all the
things of this world. Of course, you
don't want those things.
That's what they wanted.
They wanted this world and they wanted
all the goodness. They wanted a country
that all the world would want to do
business with.
They wanted a shining city on a hill.
That's what they wanted. Great
prosperity,
great glory.
You don't want those things, do you?
God is so infinite.
He or his infinite love is a trait so
virtually great that it is unknowable.
And if you think you fully know the love
of God, it shows how immature your
thinking is right now
and that you should be a little in
ashamed that you think you've got it.
John Job 36 26, God is great and we do
not know him.
That's by inspiration.
Matthew 11:27,
"No one knows the Son except the Father,
nor does anyone know the Father except
the Son."
How about this one? John 7:28, "He who
sent me is true, whom you do not know."
John 8:14, "You do not know where I come
from.
What's he saying? You don't know heaven.
You don't know God. You just think you
do.
Now, I'll tell you that you know a
little bit and I'll tell you how you do
it. But other people, it says John
15:21, they do not know him who sent me.
So, there are people who know nothing.
You know a little bit. How do you know
that? When we read of God's love being
past knowledge, what are we talking
about? Knowing God's love surpasses
knowing it progressively.
Psalm 90:2, even from everlasting to
everlasting, your God. So if you studied
the love of God forever, you still
wouldn't get to the end of it because it
is from one end to another. You can't
get an eternal thing in your head except
as a concept. You don't have a big
enough brain.
Knowing God's love surpasses knowledge
because we can say that experientially.
You only have a finite amount of time
in this world. Jeremiah 31:3, I have
loved you with an everlasting love. So,
do you know it? Not yet, but maybe one
day
kind of.
Knowing God's love surpasses knowing it
intellectually. You're not smart enough.
Nobody in this room is smart enough. As
smart as the I don't know who's got the
highest IQ in here. I know I've met a
few 140s plus. I know we got a 150 or
two here. Maybe a 160 in the room, but
the rest of us are a little lower than
that.
And even if you are a 250,
you're not smart enough.
No words are strong enough because 2
Corinthians 9:15 says, "Thanks be to God
for his indescribable gift." So this
thing describes it and it's not enough.
It's indescribable.
Oh, I got it right. Sure you do. Knowing
God's love is only known revelationally.
Without this, we've got no guide
to really understand. John 3:16, for God
so loved the world that he gave his only
begotten son. Why?
Ephesians 3:19, to know the love of
Christ which surpasses knowledge. So we
are to know something that surpasses our
ability to know and we can
revelationally.
So by revelation we know the greatest
truth that you will ever know about God.
And we learned it when we were a child
in the words of Jesus loves me this I
know for the Bible tells me so. So
you've known it all your life and yet
you will never fully know it in this
world. So here at Christmas, it's hard
to comprehend God's unknowable
and what's more unexpected love that was
revealed in Jesus. That's the reason it
says it the way it says it. It has to
express it this way that you may be able
to comprehend
with all the saints what is the width
and the length and the depth and the
height.
and to know the love of Christ which
passes knowledge that you may be filled
with all the fullness of God.
Filled with all the fullness of God.
Do you really think you understand that
a statement even fully get it? So by
revelation we'll look at four
descriptions in this text that we've
attained in the coming of Christ. Number
one
is the width. The width of God's
unexpected and unknowable love
is what we're experiencing even at this
moment. You may be able to comprehend
with all the saints. What is the width?
Romans 8:32. I'm going to use that on
and off with this. Romans 8:32 says, "He
who did not spare his own son but
delivered him up for us
all." There you have it. That's the
width. How many people have lived? I
don't know. Billions have lived. How
many are alive? Billions. How many more
will be? Billions, maybe. How many have
sinned? All, but some of them were grave
sins. All have sinned and all have
sinned gravely.
How wide is God willing to reach?
He willing to reach all.
Wow, that's a wid. Do you love everybody
in your family? Everybody, everybody you
know have treated you nice and you like
them all and everything's wonderful.
God gave Jesus for all the disobedient.
That's you, that's me, but that's every
other man, every other woman that's ever
been born or ever will be born. All John
3:16, for God so loved
the world. And then 1 John 2:2, his
propitiation is not just for us, but
also for the adds a word, the whole
world.
and John 11:32,
he has put us in a position that he
might have mercy upon all.
So, here's the thing. The Jews in the
Old Testament
thought they had a God figured out.
Watch what they did. They thought they
had God figured out and they thought
they fully knew the love of God. They
had, and by the way, they're saved the
way you are through Jesus. And they had
no clear concept of who Jesus was.
Now, think on that one just a second.
And yet, they're saved by that.
Now, they thought that they were the
only ones.
You're part of it, right?
They didn't have you in mind. cuz they
had no idea at the width that God was
going for. They thought they were it.
What do you think?
Where's your brain on the love of God?
Second truth.
Let's look at the length of God's
unexpected and unknowable love. He says
that you may be able to comprehend with
all the saints what is the width and
length to know the love of Christ.
What's the length? Romans 8:32 again
notice what it says. He who did not
spare his own son but delivered him up.
Wait, listen now. He's not talking about
just the cross.
For God to deliver Jesus up, it began in
the garden. Genesis 3:15. He was already
on the the cross. As far as God was
concerned, this is coming. Everything,
his birth, his life, everything that
occurred, all the things in the Old
Testament leading up to this, it was all
to bring Christ. Everything. Moses
wasn't about Moses. Moses was about
Christ.
Joseph wasn't about Jose. Joseph was
about Christ. Elijah wasn't about
Elijah. It was about Christ. Everything.
Everything was delivering up Jesus to
save us all. That's what the Old
Testament did. It delivered us Jesus. He
delivered him up. Not in one act, but in
millions and millions and millions of
acts, God delivered up his son.
From the Garden of Eden, the promise to
take this problem on all the way to
Bethlehem when he's born, all the way to
Jerusalem when he died. God gave Jesus
by a predestined
plan. Now, I don't understand
predetermination and predestination, and
neither do you. But here's what I will
tell you is there's no doubt that you
should ever have that everything that
Jesus did was absolutely predetermined
and predestined. Everything everything
was planned. In Romans 5 7 and 8, he did
this while we were still sinners.
Hebrews 7:25,
he did this to save us to the uttermost.
He really was doing all John 17 verses
24- 26. From the foundation of the
world, this was the plan. And Psalm 10
vers5, his mercy is everlasting. He had
planned this from everlasting. Now, I
don't understand that and neither do
you. And we can't conceive of it. But
the idea is that it was always
determined. In Psalm 103:17, mer his
mercy is from everlasting to
everlasting. He had always
delivered him up.
Before he ever made a man, he had
delivered him up.
The length of God's unexpected and
unknowable love is mindboggling when you
consider that the plan was always to
save you through a terrible death of his
son.
The depth of God's unexpected and
unknowable love.
It says, "And you may be able to
comprehend with all the saints what is
the width and length and depth." What is
the depth? Romans 8:32, he who did not
spare.
Whoa.
What did he not spare Jesus from?
Nothing.
He let him get the worst of the worst.
Now, that was my worst of the worst.
That was your worst of the worst. But he
got it. He didn't spare him.
He allowed him to be clouded.
He allowed him to be crushed.
He allowed him to be beaten. He allowed
him to be mocked. He allowed him to be
spit upon. He allowed him to be marked
with stakes sticking him in the side. He
allowed him to be nailed to a tree. He
allowed him to bleed out.
suffering, not delivering him, not not
helping. No. No. Father, no. Let him go.
Let him go. Let him suffer
for you. For me,
did not spare. He saved Old Testament
Israel this way. They didn't know it. Do
you know it yet? They had no idea this
was coming. They they read it, but they
didn't get it. Have you got me yet? That
was for you. That was for me. They
didn't know this Jesus
that he would die for us while we're
still sinners. That he would save us to
the uttermost.
They didn't know that he cared about
everybody,
even places that we consider
intolerable. Sodom and Gomorrah be more
tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah than
for other places. I mean, he cares that
much. He still cares about that place.
In Jonah chapter 2, I was in Shil. He
cares about that place. Well, I don't
think we've got a concept. I don't think
we have any idea what we're really
dealing with and how much love we're
talking about here. I think we think we
know.
I don't think we know. And I'm talking
about me here.
Maybe you figured it out. You let me
know later. Sure. Sure. In a minute you
can put in a paragraph what I need to
know.
Write a whole page.
Talk to me 20 minutes. I'm sure you got
it. Me, I'm over here going,
I don't know. It's a little much for me.
It's a little much for me. The depth of
God's unexpected and unknowable love.
Then the height,
the height of God's unexpected and
unknowable love. He says that you may be
able to comprehend with all the saints
what is the width and length and depth
and height. This this is the one I love
the most.
It Romans 8:32. He did not spare his own
son.
What was the greatest thing in heaven
other than the father himself?
the word of God, the son.
There's nothing he could have given
greater.
It's the top chef.
The biggest thing he'd have given is
what he gave.
So, Romans 8:32 when he says he did not
spare his own son, let's let's get a
grip on that.
God gave Jesus as heaven's best.
Hebrews 7:26,
he ever lives to make intercession for
you. So, heaven's best is in heaven
right now, living in heaven, making
intercession for you. He doesn't have to
say a word because he did it for you.
intercession for every sin you commit.
Every day, whatever you do wrong, he
stands there as a symbol of intercession
for you. Does he need to say anything?
Probably not. Does he need to do
anything? Probably not. But he ever
lives to make intercession for you. The
very fact that he is seated at the right
hand of the throne of God on high right
now means he's making intercession for
you. He stands in your place. He
suffered in your place. He did it. The
highest of heaven came down to the
lowest of earth. In Psalm 103:1,
it says, "As the heaven is high." Now
listen to me because this is I want to
explain to you those of you when you
hadn't listened to me when I'm talking
about Isaiah 55:es 8 and9 and you never
listened to me, didn't hear what I was
saying. You read chapter 55, then you
read chapter 54, then you read chapter
53. You just do it. Go home and do it
and you'll see what I'm talking about
now. But you need to know this verse.
Look up Psalm 103:1
and it will tell you what that is all
about. It says, "As the heavens are high
above the earth, so my mercy
is great."
So when it's talking that the heavens
are higher than the earth and my ways
are higher than your ways and my
thoughts and your health, yes, he's
smarter than us, of course. Yes, he's
got wisdom beyond us, of course. But
that's not the context of that
statement. The context of the statement
in Isaiah is the same as the Psalm
103:1.
Your mercy is evil
compared to mine.
That's how low down on the scale your
mercy is. When you've extended the
greatest amount of mercy you can think
about, it's down here on the ground and
his is in the heavens.
You don't when you begin to get what God
did in Christ, you begin to see it. His
mercy is up there. Our mercy is down
here. We don't let people off for
nothing. Somebody gets in front of me
and drives his car, I'm ready to get out
of my way. You know,
if God were like that, we'd have been
done in the garden.
It'd have been over a long time ago.
His mercies are everlasting. It says in
Isaiah 54, just in case you think he's
not talking about it. So he's in verse
in chapter 54 7 and 8 and then chapter
53. What is the mercy being talked
about? Jesus dying on the cross. That's
Isaiah 53. That is the order that it
goes backwards. You see it? You can't
miss it. What I'm trying to say is mercy
of God, mercy of man.
So now you begin to understand his love
maybe a little bit. So, we've looked at
the width, the length, the depth, the
height of God's unexpected and no
unknowable love. The Jews didn't expect
God to love the world. The Jews didn't
expect you.
You You're not on the list. How many's
off of your list? You're not on the
list. You aren't going. You're Gentiles.
Who you got on your list?
Who you got off your list? Do you really
think your thinking decides that?
Are you sure
you decide that
we do not expect God to love us?
There's the truth. Some of you sitting
there don't believe God loves you right
now.
And I'm telling you, God loves you way
more than you love you. And God loves
you way more than any of your family
loves you. And God loves you more than
any human being on this planet has ever
loved you. They can't even love the way
he loves.
And God forgives way beyond what you
forgive.
God is merciful way beyond what you can
be merciful. And when we were finally
convinced that maybe Jesus, God's son,
died for us, suddenly we knew a little
bit about love because before that, all
we knew was a little bit of affection.
We didn't know love at all.
Isaac Watts, nod guy. I'm going to talk
about him in a few weeks, Lord willing,
maybe even next Sunday. He wrote a lot
of great songs. In fact, about 750 to
800 that are appear in song books to
this day. When I survey the wondrous
cross, you know that song. Or, oh God,
our help in ages past, you know that
song. And I'm going to talk about joy to
the world. That's a song about 300
something years old. And he wrote that
song. He's a weird guy. Isaiah Isaiah,
uh, Isaac, excuse me, Isaac Watts was
kind of an odd guy, but one of the best
songs to me he wrote says, "Alas, and
did my savior bleed, and did my
sovereign die? Would he devote that
sacred head for such a sinner such as I?
The refrain is at the cross at the cross
where I first saw the light and the
burden of my heart rolled away. It was
there by faith I received my sight and
now I'm happy all the day. Was it verse
two? Was it for crimes that I have done?
Yes.
Was it for crimes that I have done? He
groaned upon the tree. Yes,
it was you that nailed him there.
Quit thinking you're a good guy.
That you're a good lady.
You're wicked and I am as well.
It was your sin. It was my sin that
nailed him there. Well, I never done
anything seriously wrong. Get over
yourself. We're dealing with a god.
You're a little nothing nearly. You're
barely here. You're barely here
for a day or two and then you're gone
and nobody will even look for where you
were 100 years from now. Nobody will
care who we were.
We're little people. Was it for crimes
that I've done? Yes. You grown upon the
tree. Amazing pity, grace unknown,
and love beyond degree.
There's the truth. Isaac Watts was
right. Candy canned or channed.
Wrote a story. It's a true story. I
thought I'd read it to you, but I think
I'm just going to tell it to you the
best I can. So, let me see if I can tell
you this story. She said this actually
happened and she's it's been she's been
interviewed by Fox. She's been
interviewed on all the networks just
about. She's been interviewed uh by New
York uh the New York Times. She's been
interviewed a lot about this story. This
actually happened. It's a few years ago.
Her son was supposed to be in a pageant
in a a little event at Christmas. Okay.
And they called it uh Christmas love.
And they were Oh, he was looking forward
to it. He was They're going to sing.
They're going to do all these things.
And she was excited about it. She wanted
to go see her son go through this.
Problem was is that when it got close,
it's like a day or so out, she realized
she had to work. She was not going to be
able to make it. And he'd been so
excited for weeks about this thing, what
his part was in it in this Christmas
pageant called love. She was s shocked a
little bit that they even used the word
Christmas love because as you well know,
Christmas has become a bad word. You can
talk about uh you know, Frosty the
Snowman. You can talk about, you know,
the red-nosed reindeer. You can talk
about anything. Talking about Santa
Claus, everything, but you're not
supposed to use the word Christmas
anymore. Y'all know how this has been.
And then this was during that time more
than it is right now. She just didn't
think there'd be anything about but so
she was shocked about it. But she wanted
to go. She wanted to see her son
perform. He was so excited. Okay.
Couldn't go. So she called up the school
and said, "Uh, do y'all have a a are you
going to have a practice or anything?"
"Oh yeah, we perform it for the kids in
the morning." "Well, can I go to that?"
"Oh yeah, you can come to that." So her
son didn't seem to care. So she went and
if you kind of understand, if y'all been
to FCA stuff in line, if there not
enough chairs, you sit on the floor. She
sat on the floor, right? So she's
sitting on the floor and these kids are
up singing and what they had is they all
the particular class all had letters and
they'd hold them up. So the first one
was a C held up a C, right? Spelling out
Christmas love. Okay, sell up a C and C
is for Christmas, right? And they sing a
little song and then H is for and then R
is you. You understand what they were
doing? And what they began to notice is
the whole crowd noticed it. She's
sitting on the floor and she noticed it
that the little bitty girl that had the
M in Christmas had it upside down.
And so when it got to her, she held up
the M, which was a W, the W, and
everybody's snickering. And you can
imagine trying to keep kids happy
because this is all just kids. And
they're all snickering.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; She's got turn a letter upside down and
she says the M is for, you know,
whatever. And when they get through and
then they got to the last letter, you
know, of E
and the crowd went silent
because what was being held up wasn't
Christmas love. Have you guessed it?
Have you seen it yet? What was being
held up was Christ
was love.
Christ was love, my friend.
And I believe he still is. Amen.
John 13:7 Jesus answered and said, "What
I'm doing, you do not understand now,
but you will know after this, you will
know of his love." You may not know it.
You may have listened to this whole
thing and sat there and said, "I got all
this. I got all this figured out. You
don't know it yet, but you will.
Oh,
you will know his love. Ephesians 2 and
verse 7. In the ages to come, he might
show the exceeding riches of his grace,
his kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
It will take forever, but about one
forever from now, you will finally know
the love of Christ in God. Here's the
thing. What's your first step to knowing
the love of God? Believe in it. Can you
believe God loves you? Can you believe
that Jesus died for you? Can you just
believe that? If you can just believe
that that's maybe true, that that not
only did he die for me, but he was
buried, he rose again, if you could just
believe that and you were willing to say
it out loud, you know, I believe that
Jesus Christ is the risen Lord. You know
what? It'll change your heart. And
that's called repentance. And if your
heart just believed enough that it could
change, then you could be immersed,
buried, and a new person come out of
that water. That's how simple it is. Do
you see how simple that is?
It's your choice. You can make it. We
can baptize you today if you wish. Come
while we stand at Moni.
