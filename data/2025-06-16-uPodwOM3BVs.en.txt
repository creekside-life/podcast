261. I'm gonna back up way off from this
microphone because I can hear an echo.
Little loud.
261.
Come we love the Lord and let our joy
join in with the court. Join us on the
sweet corn and
around the throne.
We're marching to Zion.
Beautiful, beautiful Zion. We're up to
Zion, the beautiful city of God. Let
those
who sing to you are God. The children of
the heavenly king. The children of the
heavenly king
there
may jo
beautiful beautiful
city of God.
They let our songs and every tear we
cry. We're maring through.
We're maring through
world.
We're
beautiful.
We're maring up
the beautiful city of God.
537
537.
All of God's singers get.
That's us.
Let's stand to sing a song or remain
standing for the scripture. Follow.
What a song of delight.
So bright
when all
here on
former
things that
glory up there. When all
sorrow
will be heard in that
When All
the
good evening.
Tonight's scripture reading will be read
from 1 Peter
14-17.
Again, that is 1 Peter 14-17.
Who is there to harm you if you prove
zealous for what is good? But even if
you should suffer for the sake of
righteousness, you are blessed. Do not
feel their intimidation and do not be
troubled. But sanctify Christ as Lord in
your hearts. Always be ready to make a
defense to everyone who asks
to give an account for the hope that is
in you. Yet with gentleness and
reverence, and keep a good conscience,
so that in the thing in which you are
slandered, those who were vile your good
behavior in Christ will be put to shame.
For it is better if God should will it
so that you suffer for what is doing
right rather than for what is doing
wrong. may be seated.
Music books, throws me. Mark number 588
for a song of invitation. 588.
Good evening everyone.
I'm sorry you came to see Rex speak
tonight, but you got me. Um,
unfortunately Rex and Deb are uh having
some health issues and Rex is at the uh
hospital with Deb tonight. Um, we've
encouraged them to go and stay with by
her side and we're going to continue to
pray for Deb that she can be healed
soon. Um, and uh, so
I had to put a lesson last minute. I put
a lesson together last minute. So that's
my first excuse. Second excuse, I was at
camp this last week and I didn't sleep
cuz I had the 10 to 12 year olds in my
cabin and uh on my last night one threw
up at 3:00 in the morning. It was
wonderful. Uh
depends on that's my second excuse and
I'll find some more along the way.
Right. Oh, third excuse. We don't have
uh projector. There you go. That's a
good one.
So,
I wanted to take it a little bit
differently tonight. Normally I'll pull
a a scripture a passage apart, but
tonight I wanted to do something a
little bit different, more of an
application lesson based off of what
we're trying to achieve here with our
building and our asset and our and our
our goal to reach the community.
So I guess I did this lesson back in
2015 for a lecturesship down in
Australia and I thought, you know what,
this is a good time to bring this out
again. Um,
and this originated because I was an air
traffic controller at one stage and at
my job
we had a lot of intelligent people
there. The claim is only 2% in the world
can do this job and all that stuff. But
you have this this group of very high
functioning individuals and some of them
were scientists and in their previous
jobs and chemical science engineers and
just really smart people. And we'd be in
rooms together and they found out that I
was a believing Christian.
And wow, they tore shreds off me.
There was persecution
every single day in a work environment,
which makes it even worse, right? And
this would go on for a long time. And
we've been a in a a room, we we weren't
on the control panel at that time. And
they would mock me, something chronic.
And I thought back then I was a good
Christian. Man, I grew up in the church,
you know. I'm a good Christian. I know
what I'm talking about.
They asked questions and ran circles
around me and I had no idea to answer
some how how to answer some of them. And
I'll tell you what, it tested my faith.
It really tested my faith. And it was a
time where I honestly I could have
walked away from God because of how I
was feeling. But by God's grace, I chose
to go home and get my nose stuck in his
word and read and learn and study and
try and understand.
And it was one of the worst times of my
life, but also turned into one of the
best times of my life because God forced
me to actually
actually do something right.
So, I'm faced with this this group of
people. And no joke, I would come into
work 7:30 in the morning and there would
be seven guys in a room waiting for me
just to keep going from the day before
and we would go for 3 4 hours and they
wouldn't give me a chance to speak and
they just shouting different things at
me questioning oh God's maniacal and he
loves slavery and I I but wait and it
was like that constantly and it really
broke me right
and so I went and studied and studied
and studied and finally I figured out
hang I know how to answer this. But at
the time,
I had no game plan. I I was I was caught
off off guard.
And I hated that feeling. And then I
felt so guilty because like Neil read,
thank you Neil, in 1 Peter 3:13:17, "Who
is going to harm you if you're eager to
do good?
But even if you should suffer for what
is right, you are blessed. Do not fear
their threats. Do not be frightened. But
in your heart rever Christ as Lord.
Always be prepared to give an answer to
everyone who asks you to give the reason
for the hope that you have. It's not
asking me to make an excuse for God or
or or answer for God. Give the reason
that you have. But do this with
gentleness and respect.
Very very key point. keeping a clear
conscience so that those who speak
maliciously against your good behavior
in Christ may be ashamed of their
slander. For it is better if it is God's
will to suffer for doing good than for
doing evil.
So
if I look at sports teams, they go into
battle and they have a game plan. I know
this American football that you use your
hands, right? They have a game plan when
they go in. That was a joke, everybody.
But you guys have plays. Um,
in cricket we have plays, we have a game
plan. I know in theater productions, my
wife does theater, there is a game plan
before they do their things. Right?
At work,
you have a business plan, right?
You don't just go in blind. You plan
before you you uh execute your your goal
or your mission. Um, if you go
somewhere, you plan on how you going to
get there. We plan, we plan, we we get
ready,
but when it comes to Christianity, nah,
and it caught me off guard.
And so, I want to offer to you today
just two simple things. I've talked
about this with the youth, so they
should know these. You guys should know
these, but these are two strategies that
can help you in these situations when
you're struggling and you get asked a
question that uh that is
overwhelming.
Just simple strategies on how to
navigate the discussion and have a good
discussion about God. Because ultimately
we we're called to evangelize. It's not
it's not the elders responsibility to
evangelize. Not Rex and I. It's all of
us.
We all have to do that. And the days
when we see this wonderful building
being used with people here,
that's wonderful. But we need to
evangelize. That's the whole idea behind
this building project, evangelism.
So why don't we prepare ourselves? And
how are we going to talk to people or
when we have hard questions, how are we
going to handle that? So let's firstly
start with how were we called to be in
Matthew chapter 10:16.
Um he says, "I am sending you out like
sheep among wolves. Therefore, be as
shrewd as snakes
and as innocent as doves."
So a snake is wise when an enemy
approaches.
He just quietly disappears, quietly goes
away. He's shrewd or he's camouflaged,
right? Be as innocent as doves. 2
Corinth Corinthians 5:20.
Uh, we are therefore Christ's
ambassadors.
As though God were making his app appeal
through us, we implore you on Christ's
behalf. Be reconciled to God. An
ambassador, what does an ambassador do?
Uh, they're a representative. So, you
have knowledge,
right? You have wisdom and we have
character.
Hm. Colossians 4:6.
Let your speech always be always be with
grace, seasoned with salt, that you may
know how you ought to answer each one.
So, be wise, be kind, and be tactical.
So, rules of the game.
I start off with this because the two
questions or two techniques I'm going to
give you can be somewhat powerful and in
your everyday life uh in conversation.
So rules of the game after what we've
just read um here's a saying by Hugh
Hugh Huitt. It's not the Christian life
to wound, embarrass, or play
oneupmanship with colleagues, friends,
or even opponents. But it is a common
vice that anyone can easily fall into.
We have to be kind and show grace. These
tactics are not tricks, slick ruers to
assault or embarrass anyone. They're not
to belittle or to humiliate. simply they
are used to expose
bad ill illogical thinking to guide the
truth and to help maneuver through
difficult conversation.
So I found this uh by in a book called
Tactics by Gregory Kuchall. It's called
the game plan for discussing your
Christian Convictions.
There's a lot more to this but I'm I'm
just giving you the two simple ones.
So first rule, if you get angry,
you lose. If you're belligerent with
someone, you lose. If you're loud or
interruptive, you lose. If you replace
persuasion with power, you lose. That's
not what we're about.
We're about spreading the gospel. If the
other person gets angry or defensive,
you lose. They become too involved
defending their ego.
So, offending people. We're not called
to offend people. We're called to tell
the truth. If the truth offends, so be
it. But I don't get to stand there and
go, "Wow, wow, you got a funny looking
face." No, that's not what we do, right?
But if the truth offends, so be it.
Acts chapter 17 1-4.
Sorry, I just changed my
Ah, missed the slide. Sorry.
I wanted to go over arguments before we
get into this because when I say the
word argument,
let me back up
and state.
Americans, you are very, very, very nice
people. I will say that. And you're kind
and you're caring and you're very nice
in conversation. And I find that when an
argument comes up, um, it gets quite
scary for a lot of people. And uh I want
to kind of smooth that out. The word
argument or argue actually is the
meaning to reason or or or a set of
reasons given in support of an idea, an
action or a theory. The Latin arguer uh
make clear, prove, accuse. The old
French is argumentum. It's a process of
reasoning. Nowhere in that definition
does it say fight. So when I use the
word argument, I don't mean fight. I
don't mean
we're angry with each other. I mean,
we're reasoning. And I say that because
uh
in Acts chapter 17, uh the
uh I'll read verse 1-4. Now when they
had passed through A and Falis and
Apollia, they came to Thessalonica where
there was a synagogue of the Jews. And
Paul, as his custom was, went to them
and for three Sabbaths reasoned with
them.
For weeks, he reasoned with them from
the scriptures. He argued with them from
the scriptures. Paul's not fighting.
They're reasoning. They're trying to
find truth, exploring and demonstrating
for uh that the Christ had to suffer and
rise again from the dead and saying,
"This is Jesus whom I preach to you is
the Christ." And some of them were
persuaded and a great multitude of the
devout Greeks and not a few of the
leading sorry and not a few of the
leading women uh join Paul and Silas.
You see one of our
one of our first defenses to protect us
from this uh from the hazards of the
world is Mark 12:30. We uh and you shall
love the Lord your God with all your
heart and all your soul and with all
your mind, right? And with all your
strength. Your mind is not passive.
It's God-given.
Uh it
it's a gift from God to to go through
logic, through reasoning, through
rationality. Right? If I say to you,
well, the kettle's boiling. Why is the
kettle boiling?
Well, we could say,
you know, the elements heating up and
the molecules excite and they rub
together and it gets hotter and warmer
and it starts to boil. Okay, that's
wonderful. We reason through that. But
how about this reason? It's boiling
because I want a cup of tea.
Right? We have to use our brain. We have
to use our rationale, our logic. It's
given to us by God. Right? So don't be
scared of arguments.
Um it's just it's just an avenue of
reasoning and finding truth.
um in 2 Timothy 2 and to 2 Timothy 4, it
warns us against quarreling foolishly on
speculations, but also to be diligent.
Handle the word of truth accurately and
rep rebuke and exhort when necessary.
Right? Don't fear this conflict.
So in a church scenario, we talk about
being one mind. To be of one mind
biblically doesn't mean that all have to
share the same opinion. One mind means
warm warm fellowship based on communion
with Christ in the midst of differences.
True maturity means learning how to
disagree yet still maintaining a
peaceful harmony in the congregation.
It does not mean to be mean-spirited,
hostile, malicious and make malicious
labels like false teachers. Um arguments
are good and disputes are healthy. They
clarify the truth and protect us from
error and religious uh desperatism. When
the church discourages principled
principal debates and a free flow of
ideas, the result is shallow
Christianity and a false sense of unity.
How do we learn otherwise?
Out in the world, I want you to remember
nothing happens without God.
In John 6:44, no one can come to me
unless the father who sent me draws him
and I will raise him up on the last day.
The equation here is without God's work,
nothing else works. But with God's work,
many things work. Under the influence of
the Holy Spirit, love persuades and by
the power of God, the gospel transforms.
And the and with Jesus at work,
arguments convince. So why am I saying
all that?
During this time when I was going
through this uh persecution I guess
which is really minor in the big scheme
of things
you often feel alone.
You often feel like a failure maybe.
And because I was brought up in the
church of Christ and I'm told you got to
you got to baptize people. You got to
get them under the water. Yeah. We got
to do that. We got to it sounds kind of
forceful. And so when when and this is
my bad thinking, but when I've failed in
doing that, you feel like a failure.
You feel like you messed up. And it gets
worse. And I go home and I'm like, I'm
sorry, God. You know, I'm I'm clearly I
have no idea what I'm doing. I'm not
worthy. Why would you even bother with
me? And you lose your you lose any
confidence you ever had
until I read John chapter 4:34:38. And I
love this.
Jesus uh after talking to the Samaritan
woman, his disciples are with him. And
in verse 34, he says, "My food, said
Jesus, is to do the will of him who sent
me and to finish his work." Don't you
have a saying? It's still 4 months until
harvest. I tell you, open your eyes and
look at the fields. They are ripe for
harvest. Even now, the one who reaps
draws a wage. and uh harvest a crop to
have eternal life so that the swer and
the reaper may be glad together. Thus
the saying one the swer uh one sws and
the other reaps is true. I sent you to
reap what you have not worked for.
Others have done the hard work and you
have reaped the benefits of their labor.
That changed my whole thinking
where I thought I had to sew and reap,
right? Teach and then baptize.
I was so convinced that if I didn't do
that, I was unsuccessful. I was failing.
And when I read this, Jesus saying, "No,
some have swed while you reap. You've
done no work. You've done no work here,
but you're reaping. You're harvesting."
And so there's this this partnership
that goes on with God that I so badly
clearly forgot
that I'm not alone. I'm not alone in
this this uh I guess the spiritual war
that I was in at that moment. I'm not
alone. But I forgot that.
But little did I know I was I was I was
sewing without understanding what I was
doing. God was using me. Uh it was like
a few days later, one of one guy in the
office, he had watched the carnage ensue
and he came to me and he's like, "Man,
I'm really impressed with how you
handled yourself. Why don't we go for a
walk and we can talk about Jesus?" I did
not see that coming. That was crazy.
One sws, one reaps. And it took that big
pressure off me. Right. So, I'm getting
to the two tactics. I promise you. I'm
just need to build this uh build this
for you guys. So, let's change our
thinking. Sers and reapers.
Set a modest goal.
Never set out to convert anyone. I love
this idea. Put a stone in their shoe.
Have you ever walked with a stone in
your shoe? Come to Bible camp. Walk with
a stone in your shoe. Right? It's
uncomfortable
and it's there and it it's always
reminding you and it's ah I got to get
to that. I got to get to that. Right.
My goal now is to put a stone in
someone's shoe. Get them thinking about
this over and over and over again. I
love that. So I never try to hit a
winning run. I just want the chance to
bat. That's all.
So don't get discouraged if you don't
convert someone. John 10:27. My sheep
listen to my voice. I know them and they
follow me. I give them eternal life and
they shall never perish. No one will
snatch them out of my hand. No one will
snatch them out of my hand.
Think of your own journey, right? Did
Jesus convert everyone? Him who has
ears, let him hear.
So, what I find is you have a 10-second
window. You have a 10-second window in
some situations to put a stone in
someone's shoe. Are you ready for that?
someone makes a statement, how can I
quickly get in there and start talking
about Jesus with them? Now, this could
be, I don't know, at a restaurant. This
could be at work. This could be with
family. There's always a window. God's
going to give you an opportunity. I
think we've just got lazy looking for
them. Or maybe we're too scared and lost
our confidence because we don't have a
game plan on how to handle it in that
moment. Right? So 10-second window.
Someone says, "I've read the Bible." I
hear someone in the office. "I've read
the Bible before." People take it too
seriously.
That's not a conversation I really want
to have, but it's an opening.
Um it's not rational to believe in God.
There's no proof. There's an opening.
You can't take the Bible seriously
because it's only given by men. And when
and men make mistakes, there's an
opening. Are you ready? 10 seconds.
They've moved on. They're talking about
something else. You've missed your shot.
It's wrong to force your views on other
people. Cool. First thing you need to
do, obviously, pray for wisdom. Lord,
please help me here. I want to put a
stone in somebody's shoe.
What can I do?
So, for all the older folk here, do you
guys remember Detective Columbbo?
There you go. Got some. And the youth,
no. Detective Columbombo, he was kind of
clumsy, right? Stumbled over and gets
his notepad and he gets his pen and
stumbles around a bit and uh he asks
questions. You know what? I just forgot
that one thing. Uh did you perhaps do
this and that?
You know what? He was kind of clumsy and
he broke down people's walls just by
asking questions.
That's all I'm saying to you tonight.
ask questions.
Um the
in James 1:19, my dear brothers and
sisters, take note of this. Everyone
should be quick to listen and slow to
speak and slow to become angry. So how
do we listen? We gather information. How
do you gather information? You ask
questions. First question, first tactic.
What do you mean by that?
That sounds so simple, right? If I go
back to uh previous thing, uh I've read
the Bible before. People take it too
seriously. Oh, wow. What do you mean by
that?
Now we're engaged. Now we're talking
and I'm not explaining myself. I'm not
having to go, "Well, you know, the Bible
does this, this, and this." And I don't
have to be on the defensive.
They're now talking to me and I'm
getting to learn from them. I'm getting
a free education, right? The power of a
question. It engages that person. It
shows interest um that you care and that
their views are important too. It forces
them to think carefully.
You get a free education like I said and
it also takes the pressure off.
I'm no longer feeling like I have to
come up with these amazing scriptures
and and equations and explain things and
oh well the manuscript says and and
what do you mean by that? I'm curious. I
want to know. Please share that with me.
Yeah. And we do that in normal
conversation.
If someone says something obscure to me,
oh, the sky is turquoise, blue, green
with a hint of purple, I don't know.
What do you mean by that?
And we get we're chatting. We're just
having a nice conversation. Same thing.
What do you mean by that?
I like to use this in Bible studies as
well.
Um I use it on the youth a lot and they
try and give me an answer and I'm like
what do you mean by that? And slowly I
get them to explain things right and
it's a good learn teaching technique as
well. But what we see in the Bible is
Jesus asked 307 questions. He was asked
183
to figure that out. He was asked 183
questions and he asked 307.
often he answered a question with
another question.
So don't I want to be more like Jesus?
Do not formulate arguments. Sorry. Do
not formulate arguments while someone is
talking. It's rude. Give them your
undivided attention. Often when we get
caught up in these situations, I am
formulating my next argument while
they're speaking.
And then I come out and I say something
because ah I've got the answer and it
had nothing to do with what they were
saying.
Be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow
to become angry.
Um in that situation, what I find is
helpful is is use your fingers as
points. So, hey, I need to say this, I
need to say that. But let them finish.
listen to what they have to say because
nine times out of 10 they might be
telling you what's really truly needed.
Matthew 21:23, I don't want to read that
cuz we're going to run out of time, but
um same thing when the the Jews come to
Jesus and by whose authority are you
doing this? And and Jesus says, "You
know what? I'm going to ask you a
question before I answer that." Right?
Questions, questions. So important. Um,
it gives you that confidence as well. It
takes that pressure off.
Think of if you were sitting with next
to someone in an airplane and they saw
you reading your Bible and they said,
"Ah, this thing again."
And you're like, "Oh, yeah. I got a good
opportunity. Let me just start
preaching. Let me get straight into it."
Well, you know, brother, um, Jesus is
the only way and you need to repent. And
off we go.
Later on, I find out that they used to
be a Christian and maybe there was abuse
at church and they want nothing to do
with that now. Don't you think that
would have been helpful if I just asked
questions, got to know someone first,
got to know where they're at? Wow, I'm
sorry that happened. It's not how it
should be. That's not what Jesus is
calling us to do, right?
By asking questions, we can find out
more information.
Um, when people ask me about slavery
back
when I was younger, I didn't know how to
answer the slavery questions in the
Bible. I struggle with that. I didn't
really think about that stuff.
But one of my smart colleagues was like,
"Wow, God, God's a god of slavery. He
loves slavery." And I didn't know how to
answer that. I'm embarrassed to say I
didn't know how to answer that. But at
the time all I had to do was what do you
mean by that
and get him talking about it and slowly
as someone else talks the walls break
down.
Um you know God's maniacal god and all
these in the virgin birth doesn't isn't
real. It doesn't mean anything. There's
there's a lot of this stuff that people
come up with.
One of the things you you can do as well
is reversing the burden of proof.
Whoever makes the claim bears the
burden. So, whoever makes the truth
claim um subjective or objective has to
explain it. So, it's not my duty to
prove them wrong. It's your duty to
listen, gather information. What do you
mean by that? Don't get thrust into a
defensive position when the other mo
person is making a truth claim. Right?
Romans. I love Romans. Paul writes the
book of Romans. It's a book of logic.
The study of logic comes from Romans.
And so there's this idea that if you
make a truth claim, you have a roof,
right?
But what holds a roof up? You need to
have stable walls.
So you test the evidence. You test the
logic. You test the reasoning. And if
the walls crumble, the truth claim will
will tumble, right?
And a a roof without walls is useless.
It's just opinions. So we test the
walls. So like Columbombo, he reverses
the burden of proof. The second question
that I have in my uh toolkit, how did
you come to that conclusion? Yeah, I see
you guys ming it. Good stuff. How did
you come to that conclusion? I want to
know more. Oh, what do you mean by that?
Cool. Conversation goes. Then they say
something that I know totally opposes
the Bible. Oh, wow. Interesting. How did
you come to that conclusion?
I want to test the possibility, the
plausibility, and the probability of
their truth claim.
There's a way to also get out of this
hot seat. Obviously, when it gets too
much, it gets too overwhelming. Let me
think about that. Right? Take the egos
off the table. Uh the person wants to
give you their view, so let them. Uh,
but hey, it sounds like you know a lot
more about this than I do and have some
interesting ideas. Um, the problem is
that this is all new information to me.
I wonder if you could do me a favor. I
really want to understand your points.
Could you slow down so that I can get
them right? Please help me understand
and carefully explain your reasoning.
I'm trying to take the anger out of this
and be kind. I truly do want to get to
know someone. I truly do want to bring
them to Christ.
In other words, I'm saying, "Oh, so you
want to beat me up? Fine with me. Just
do it slowly and thoroughly."
Turning the other cheek uh takes the
power away from the bully. Right?
So, it's two simple simple techniques.
What do you mean by that? And how did
you come to that conclusion? And I
promise you, those two techniques will
give you confidence in situations when
we need to speak about Jesus or when
there's an opportunity to speak about
Jesus. You have a game plan now. We're
ready. I'm not caught on the back foot.
Uh well, um then trying to explain
myself and looking foolish.
Lord, please help me. What do you mean
by that?
All right. Get to know someone. Oh, wow.
That's very interesting. How did you
come to that conclusion?
And slowly you start to share your
faith. We share ideas and we evangelize.
And I share my story about how I came to
know Christ.
We're called.
Mark 16:15, it says, "Go into all the
world and proclaim the gospel to the
whole creation." We're called to do
this, church.
And I fear that we have lost our
confidence.
I fear that it's become too chaotic
that we didn't we don't really have
direction anymore.
And I'm saying, why don't we just have a
game plan?
Why don't we learn how to speak to
people?
Because I am told I have to go into the
world and preach the gospel, share the
gospel with the whole of creation.
What scares me the most is if I ask,
"What is the gospel?" Most people don't
even know what the gospel is. And we're
called to share it. First Corinthians
15, Christ lived, he died, and he was
raised again. Right? That's good news.
We are called to do that, church.
And as we grow in this congregation, as
this building expands and as our vision
comes to fruition, that's wonderful.
But the vision is to evangelize.
And we need direction. We need to have a
game plan. And we need to be able to
talk to people and not shy away from our
faith and not be embarrassed by what
Jesus has done for me and and not be
scared of of of of being embarrassed.
Here are some some great scriptures.
Don't take it personally. When you feel
like you fail or you're embarrassed or
something, don't take it personally.
Romans 15:3, the insults of those who
insult you have fallen on me. Matthew
5:10, "Blessed are those who are
persecuted because of righteousness, for
theirs is king of heaven." 2 Corinthians
12:10. That is why for Christ's sake I
delight in weaknesses,
in insults, in hardships, in
persecution, in difficulties. For when I
am weak, then I am strong. Huh? Second
Timothy 3:12. In fact, everyone who
wants to live a godly life in Christ
will be persecuted.
Right.
Matthew 5:11. Blessed are those
uh blessed are you when people insult
you, persecute you when falsely say all
kinds of evil against you because of me.
Luke 6:22. Blessed are you when people
hate you, when they exclude you and
insult you and reject you, your name as
evil because of the son of man. John
15:18, Romans 8:35, Matthew 5:44, Romans
12:14, Mark 10:29-38. It goes on and on
and on and on and on.
Don't be ashamed of the gospel.
Don't be embarrassed. Don't be Don't be
fearful.
We are called to spread the gospel.
Let's do that. If you need Jesus, um,
you're welcome to come forward. We will
help you find a relationship with
Christ. But after that, share the gospel
with everyone you can. Let's stand and
sing.
What can make me whole again? Nothing
but the blood of Jesus.
Oh, precious is the flow that makes me
white as snow.
No other found I know. Nothing but the
blood of Jesus.
For my pardon, this I see. Nothing but
the blood of Jesus.
For my cleansing this my plea, nothing
but the blood of Jesus.
Oh, precious is the flow that makes me
white as snow.
No other found I know. Nothing but the
blood of Jesus.
Nothing can for sin atone. Nothing but
the blood of Jesus.
Not of good that I have done. Nothing
but the blood of Jesus.
Oh, precious is the flow that makes me
white as snow.
No other found I know. Nothing but the
blood of Jesus.
Would you be seated?
290.
As you turn there, if you here with us
this evening, have not had chance to
take the Lord's supper, get prepared. If
you'll make your way to the room on on
your right over there, it will be served
over there. 290 will sing the first and
last verses.
