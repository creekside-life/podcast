now some parents you know offer their
kids money for every a they make or
every a they make on uh a test a hundred
um but it usually costs them little or
nothing in my case so uh it should not
surprise us if our greatest test of
faith actually comes often from our
family I mean there is abuse there
there's
molestation there's all kinds of tests
and
temptations there's those in our
families that would mislead us or
neglect us there are those that have
been in our families who are LED around
by their
unbelief they want to stay home they
don't want to go to church they want to
stay away from us potentially their
feelings have been hurt they don't want
to go to church or they don't want to be
around
us you know I I quit church because
Johnny's feelings were
hurt yeah it shouldn't surprise you if
one of our greatest spiritual tests
comes through our family that we love so
much at least usually love so much so we
want to look into that and how Abraham
dealt with that Matthew chapter 10 and
verse 37 it says he who loves father or
mother now imagine that
your father and mother how much you love
them Father or mother more than me is
not worthy of me and who loves son or
daughter more than me I mean most of us
would die for our children if you love
your son or daughter more than me is not
worthy of me Matthew 19:29 this read a
while ago it's the same message uh you
leave brother or sister father or mother
wife children for my name's sake
relationships can test and try the best
of us it can test our faith it can test
our commitment it can test our sincerity
relationships can strain and
squeeze weaknesses out of us you
discover that you have weaknesses you
did not know you had through your family
and it can discover fleshling in US
relationships can strain your good
traits your mercy your love your
kindness you may not have thought about
it but probably you've been uglier to
people that you love than you have
strangers how many times has a divorce
or some Prejudice kept children from
being
baptized
I've seen a lot of families that would
with withdraw
Fellowship from a member of their family
who's in sin and who would not repent
I've seen families like that but as I
tell you I've seen families like that
I've also seen a lot of families that
would not say
boo to their family members who are
living in sin would never make them feel
bad or sad or
hurt while they're in the middle of
terrible
sin wouldn't even encourage them to
repent almost to the point that they
would brag on their family member who
misbehaves seen that you have
too who is your priority God or your
relatives
now here's a question for you would you
knowingly allow a
relative to molest your spouse or your
child in the Name of Love and
family probably
not why then would you knowingly allow
relative to be evil and lead your family
astray from the Faith In The Name of
Love and family we've got to stick
together have you thought that
through a Abram
Abraham faced his greatest test of his
faith 4,000 years ago through his
family and we want to look at those
there's seven sources of Abraham's
family tests let me walk you through
them number one and you need to ask
yourself this question because he had to
will you choose your father father over
God you may not realize this but you
know he was told and to leave his
father's house Genesis 12:1 now the Lord
had said to Abraham get out of your
country and from your family and from
your father's house to a land that I
will show you get out of your father's
house why did he want him out of his
father's house well Joshua makes it very
clear uh it says thus says the Lord God
of Israel verse two of Joshua 24 your
fathers including Tara
that's Abraham's father the father of
Abraham and the father of nahor that's
Abraham's brother dwelt on the other
side of the river in old times and they
served other
gods Abraham needed to leave
that but did you know in Acts 7 verse4
it says this that he came out of the
land of the calans this is about Abraham
he came out of the calans that's her of
Cala and dwelt in Heron which is named
after his brother who died in Earth and
from there when his father was dead he
moved him to this land here's what I
want you to see as good as gold as
Abraham
was even though he was called to leave
his father's household he only left his
father's household after his father was
dead it's not so easy to leave it's not
so so easy to choose God over your
father I don't know about you but we
we've all got to at some point say does
my daddy rule my life or does
God number two will you choose your
brother over
God love my brother you love your
brother hope so most of the time anyway
ex when I hit him uh Genesis 24
we know the story probably really well
Genesis 24:6 says but Abraham said to
him beware that you do not take my son
back there that's when he asked his best
servant to go and look for a wife among
his brother's
family but what is interesting now
that's nahor his brother who who may
have been the one just a little older
than him heran probably was the oldest
and Abram was probably the baby of the
family but
nahor was supposedly someone who kind of
believed like
Abraham but it was important Abraham
said don't you take my son back
there he's got to live
here I've got to choose what God told me
to do over my brother
if I had to make that
chest would you choose God over your
brother your
sister Abraham had to think about it had
to work his way through it verse eight
of Genesis 24 says and if the woman is
not willing to follow you that is the
bride supposedly for Isaac it says then
you will be released from this oath only
do not take my son back there he said is
this twice making sure Abraham made the
choice not my
brother don't go that way so Abraham's
family tests are will you choose your
brother over God will you choose your
father over God will you choose your
brother over god let's notice his next
test will you choose your nephew over
God now most of you know
that Heron his brother who died had a
son
and his name was
lot and that's the brother who died in
ER of Calin we don't know anything about
this story but apparently just as his
brother nahor had taken over taken on
one of the daughters of Heron he took on
his son and took care of him and raised
him up and lot went with him when he
left his father's house to the land of
Canaan lot went with him because he had
been taken care of of him I got a
responsibility to those in my family
amen amen we have responsibilities in
Genesis chapter 13 veres 1-8 a really
good discussion of what happened though
lot began to have his own herdsman he
began to have his own herds and things
began to fall out between his workers
and Abram's workers right and so Abraham
proposes that he choose lot you choose
which way do you go but we've got to
separate oursel now here's the
interesting thing you need to remember
remember what the call originally was
separate yourself from your father's
house and from the families he wants a
separation he hadn't actually quite ever
done that totally because lot was still
in the list what it says though
interestingly enough in Genesis 13 and
verse 14 look what it says and the Lord
said to Abraham after lot had separated
from him now this is interesting
immediately after he finally does
something he was told to do it says lift
up your eyes
now is't that
interesting and look from the place
where you are northward Southward
Eastward Westward for the land which you
see I give to you in your descendants
forever you finally have really cut the
tie that I'm asking you to cut you say
would you ever have to cut the tie with
a niece or a
nephew
yeah yeah been there done that got the
T-shirt I'm telling you it's okay to cut
off family members folks and that might
be your nephew it might be your
niece but you got to go on and do now
Abram now granted saved him when he
saved the people who were taken away in
the battle for Sodom that's true but he
delivered him right you know he saved
him from the Battle of of Sodom but then
he goes and he moves back to Sodom and
Sodom disintegrates and destroys his
family Abram prays for them he gets down
to 10 because 10's the number of people
that's in lot's family if you do the
math you find out immediately the final
10 that Abraham says the Lord if there's
just 10 righteous that includes his
daughter's husbands and his sons wives
and his other daughters so he had 10
there so Abraham still prayed for him
but he separated from him you get a
message there you still pray for them
but you might need to separate from them
how about this
one did it not move is it not
moving
is it all locked up can you'all move to
the next there we go I knew y' want to
get on this one will you choose your
concubine over
God how's that
apply
gentleman another
woman
ladies another
man a boyfriend or a girlfriend or a
mistress or the temptation to go that
way now you can say because we're all in
church I've never had a
temptation but there are honest people
in here that might go
well
well in Genesis
21 verse 11 says and the matter was very
displeasing in Abraham's sight because
of his son so at some point he realized
you know he'd had that made for a while
about 10
years okay and ishma was born through
this ma now this was Sarah's idea
granted but he didn't have to be begged
to go along with
it he
says in Genesis 16 and verse 2 and Sarah
said to Abram see now Lord the Lord has
restrained me from bearing children
please go into my maid perhaps I shall
obtain children by her and Abraham put
up a big argument that's not what it
says and Abram heeded the voice of
Sarah immediately heeded the voice of
Sarah a flirting man a flirting
woman yeah you have all run into that
somebody that hugs you the wrong way
holds your hand the wrong way talks to
you the wrong way says inappropriate
things to you you've all all walk
there all walk there in Genesis 21 it
says and the matter was very displeasing
in Abraham's sight because of his son
and that's what it says but listen to
What God Says in verse 12 but God said
to Abraham do not let it be displeasing
in your sight because the lad or because
of the Bond
woman whether Sarah has said to you
listen to her voice for Isaac seed shall
be called God God didn't miss it it
wasn't just about the
boy it about the
woman will you choose
your concubine your woman that's
flirting with you the man who's flirting
with you over
God you say well that's never been a
Temptation you just had live long enough
then number four will you choose your
stepson over
god wow how could that ever be in
Genesis 17 beginning verse 15 going
through 22 I'm just going to pick up in
verse 17 up here on the screen it says
then Abraham fell in his face and
laughed and said s this after God's
delivered this message through these
Messengers again that Sarah's going to
have a
child now he says and Abraham fell on
his face and laughed h
sure and said in his heart shall a child
be born to a man who is 100 years old
and shall Sarah who is 90 years old bear
a son Verse 18 and Abraham said oh that
ishmail might live before you he had a
problem Ishmael not being the number one
kid now I don't know if you're aware of
this but sometimes people get a number
one kid and a number two kid and a
number three kid
and by the way they don't just do that
when they're born in your household that
happens when you
adopted or when you Foster and if you're
not careful you'll end up choosing a kid
over God step kids know this all too
well will you choose your
stepson over God your
stepdaughter over God I got to make them
happy
they're not happy at Bell's Creek Side
we'll go
elsewhere be
careful see Abraham had make these
choices he had to walk this path here's
one for you and this is this is a tough
one here will you choose your wife or
your husband in your case
ladies over
God Sarah was
Barren
um he went around because she's pretty
scared to death somebody's going to kill
him now listen to me now just think
about that just a second does he trust
God or not you got to
lie you either trust God or you don't
right at some point you got to you get
out of your car on a dangerous looking
street but at some point you got to
trust God is with you amen you just got
to trust Genesis 20:2 now Abraham said
of Sarah's wife wife she is my sister
and aimc king of gerro sent and took
Sarah now I want you to think about what
he just put his wife through the
potential of what he just did to his
wife are you sound like you're talking
bad about Abraham no I'm talking about
him like he's a
man he's a man right right so what did
he just do he put his wife in a
precarious position to save his skin
because he didn't trust God to save his
skin he's choosing his wife and
himself over
God God never said Sarah your sister he
never refers to her that way have you
noticed there's not one scripture in the
Old Testament says to Abraham now Sarah
your sister sari your sister he never
says that he says Sarah your wife Sarah
your wife he always says it God's not
afraid to call her his
wife would you ever choose your husband
ladies over
God over
truth over
protection leave the church to keep
them do you know how many people have
done what I'm talking about this
morning do you know we couldn't fill
this building 15 times probably today
with the number of people who've left
for their family
it's my test
too it's all of our test will you choose
your
mate over
God can you get the next one I can't
change it it's not changing me thank you
will you choose your son over
God Genesis 22 there it's a great
passage you should read verses 1 through
19 I'm not for the sake of time I'm not
going to do that I'm going just pick up
verse two then he said take now your son
your only son
Isaac listen to the way he describes it
your only
son so what about
ishmail your only
son whom you
love things have changed
and go to the land of Mariah and offer
him there as a burnt offering on one of
the mountains of which I should tell
you now what Abraham did he's gained
strength spiritually all this time and
he didn't stagger in unbelief here he
got up early the next morning cut the
wood put it on the animal and they left
out would you choose your son or your
daughter or over
God would you risk their
life for the cause of
Christ it's not as easy as you
think wait until you do it take them on
a mission trip where they're in good
medical
support what would you
do so here's the tests if you go to the
next slide here are the tests being real
simple here
got to get to the
end this was what he was put through
would you choose your father over
God would you choose your brother over
God would you choose your nephew over
God would you choose your concubine your
girlfriend your boyfriend over God would
you choose your stepson over God would
you your stepdaughter over God would you
choose your wife over God would you
choose your son over God what will you
do that's
tough no other gods before him he
says you remember that first The Ten
Commandments Thou shalt have no of the
Gods before
me do you understand now
why father mother brother
sister can't go before him you just turn
them into God if you would leave the
church to be with your family and
support your family you love them more
than than
God you just made them
God John Deacon wrote the song I Want to
Break Free if you don't listen to Queen
you wouldn't know that one but any r i
want to break free at some point you've
got to learn to break
free you can't let family be your
God I love my family I die for my family
amen give them everything I've got
happily so they can have the last penny
and if they need a liver they got it you
know whatever they
need but not
God but not God Abraham the father the
faithful passed all his test and chose
God above all above all he chose God
Paul baluch and ly Lenny LeBlanc wrote
if you go to the next slide wrote the
song you've probably heard above all
above all Kings above all nature and all
created things above all wisdom and all
the ways of man we were here before the
you were here before the world began
above all kingdoms above all Thrones of
All Above All wonders this world has
ever known above all wealth and
Treasures of the earth there's no way to
measure what you're worth
crucified laid behind the
stone but you live to die rejected and
alone like a rose trampled on the ground
you took the
fall and he thought of
me above
all
you mean the great
God chose you above
all but you can't choose him above your
family
hello Above
All Above All Thou shalt have no other
God before me what's number one with
you
my wife cannot be number one in my life
my children cannot be number one in my
life my brothers my sisters my step kids
can't be number one in my life it has to
be this Brethren are you aren't serving
God you're serving your
family and that's your
God if Jesus is not first he refuses to
be second if God's not number one in
your life he is not number
two he thought of us above
all can you and
I think of him above
all if you would be willing to do that
we would help you in every way we can
today come back to the Lord repent of
sins or come to the Lord For the First
Time repenting of your sins confessing
Christ being baptized and that whole
point is you died to all that was you
and you live to all that's
him is God above all in your life if
he's not the invitation is yours why we
stand and while we
sing
