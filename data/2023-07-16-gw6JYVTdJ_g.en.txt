I think one of the things that you see a
lack of self-control in more than
anything else is probably
anger anger is clearly an example of a
lack of
self-control a young
man was weaving in and out of traffic in
his vehicle y'all have been on the
streets you've seen that but he was
driving too fast he was cutting people
off and he was cursing at people as he
passed them by making signs and gestures
at them and driving entirely too fast
and had been nearly causing wrecks he
had to stop because he came to a light
with a lot of
cars a man behind him drove up parked
behind him who he had obviously cut off
previously he got out of his car walked
over to the driver's door stuck the
muzzle of his gun through the window
and killed
him that's not make
believe that's two men out of
control a husband once said to his wife
you know sweetheart you know I get mad
and I don't control myself but you seem
to remain calm whenever we're in these
big arguments you just don't lose
control how do you maintain such
self-control
she says well I just go afterward and
clean the
toilet well how does that help he said
well I use your
toothbrush so who's maintaining
self-control the Greek words used for
self-control mean a variety of things
but mainly has a central concept
self-control
self-controlled to exercise or have
self-control to have strong power or
Mastery of ourself Mastery to have a
soundness of mind even to control
yourself to be discreet or to do it
discreetly to use self-restraint to be
sober minded so that you can control
yourself so it's not a case of not
understanding what the word means this
is the last one in this series
on the fruits of the spirit it's not
really a case of that you didn't know
all this is it that's not the
problem it's implementation isn't it how
do we implement
it there are
extremes of what would call the
unfruitful the people who haven't used
self-control never accepted self-control
never accepted responsibility for
self-control who never take hold of of
self-control there are those who want to
control everybody and everything but
themsel you may remember the song by
Jonathan Edwards back in 1971 it's
called Sunshine he can't even run his
own life but he's going to try to run
mine
yeah another extreme out there really is
those who do not want to control anybody
or anything especially
themselves so and they feel good about
that and so as a result a lot of people
who are literally out of control I saw
this the other day this is a website
listen to these words you want to stay
high
longer by utilizing the right
consumption techniques and used a word
here I don't know what it is and
cabino alonger more potent high is well
within your grasp just don't forget to
increase your intake too test out these
theories for for yourself shop online
menu now or drop by our Venice Beach
dispensary and see what helps you stay
high yeah that's what we
need another example of this extremity
is those who would love to have
self-control as long as it's easy
especially if it's in a
bottle
right how many people are on medication
right now because they chose not to self
contr control but they're seeking a drug
to control
themselves now a lot of people justify
this what were the people doing before
the
drug what did the world do before the
drug you ask
yourself why you're taking the
pill and then there's another extreme
out there
who believe they cannot help being the
way they are you see it's everybody
else's
fault now I've done a little counseling
hated every minute of it please don't
come see me
uh don't don't like giving people
advice I don't I will do it if you
really need it but don't come just to
waste my
time because I don't want to really get
into your business do you understand
that I really don't want to know your
business and I really don't want to give
you advice and tell you how to run your
business and this is the reason why
because what I'm talking about right
now here's what usually happens people
come to see you in counseling because
they are convinced it's not their
fault it's the other person's
fault and they just want affirmation of
that
and then they want you to tear a strip
off the other
person no one wants to take
responsibility for their
thing now that's not always true but it
is so often true that here's what will
happen how dare you an ignorant preacher
tell me I could fix this this is a
psychological Problem by the way
psychological comes from the idea of
Soul study
problem it it's been done to
me I've done no wrong I can't help
it really what you come to see me for
then right think about that just a
second it doesn't really work and by the
way you can't help it and I don't care
what the problem is you're not out of
control but what for another day we'll
talk about that when you're more ready
to hear that we want to talk about now
the 10 commandments of self-control so
if you want to learn how to control
yourself here are the 10 commandments
the Bible gives you
10 valid ways you can control yourself
you can behave yourself you can keep
your thinking straight you can keep your
life straight now let me tell you
something you won't do these 10 things
and neither will I but at least we'll
know what they are and we'll do them
sometimes but we will not do them all
the time I'm telling you straight up you
will not do all of these
amen so that really does work and God
does protect you from greater
Temptation whoops I didn't mean to do
that sorry well I went everywhere where
did I go going back what's going on here
well okay back
here that's are we no back one more wow
didn't mean to do that second one is
Matthew 5:
27-30 it says you have heard that it was
said to those of old you shall not
commit adultery but I say to you that
whoever looks at a woman to Lust For Her
has already committed adultery
within uh his
heart if your right eye causes you to
sin pluck it out do you really think
it's talking about your eye and cast it
from you for it is more profitable for
you you that one of your members perish
than for your whole body to be cast into
hell and if your right hand causes you
to sin cut it off and cast it from you
for it is more profitable for you that
one of your members perish than for your
whole body to be cast into
hell there are people you need to sever
yourselves from if you're having a
problem there may be a woman at work
separation cut it off otherwise you
don't really mean it do you number three
exercise self-control by abstaining Acts
chapter 15 beginning in verse 19
therefore I judge that we should not
trouble those from among the Gentiles
who are turning to God but that we write
to them to abstain from things polluted
by Idols well I can't help it yeah you
can from sexual immorality but I can't
help it yes you can from things
strangled and from blood so don't play
with it abstain from it there are some
things you just need to stay away from
but more than that you need to abstain
from because you think that you can
let's say you're an alcoholic you can't
take a little bit can't have a little
bit got to leave it alone abstain from
it number next a exercise self-control
by willing or by willpower in Romans
chapter 7 beginning in verse 15 and this
is not an easy thing but I need you to
understand that while I'm probably not
going to use this and you're probably
not going to use this
consecutively it is possible it says in
Romans chapter 7 beginning in verse 15
for what I am doing I do not understand
for what I will to do that I do not
practice but what I hate that I do if
then I do what I will not to do I agree
with the law that is good but now it is
no longer I who do it but sin that
dwells in me for I know that in me that
is in my flesh nothing good dwells for
to will to is present with me but how to
perform what is good I do not find verse
19 for the good that I will to do I I do
not do but the evil I will not to do
that I practice you're no better than
Paul so don't be sitting there saying
that's not me verse 20 now if I do what
I will not to do it is no longer I who
do it but sin that dwells in me I find
then a law that is that evil is present
with me that one who Wills to do good so
it's always sin is always present with
me verse 22 for I Delight in the law of
God according to the inward man but I
see another law or principle in my
members Waring against the law of my
mind and bringing me into captivity to
the law of sin which is uh in my
members
Purity strong decisions can be made
about
purity and where do you make those
strong
decisions
here if you wait young people till you
get in the car with a girl you like it's
too late to make the
decision you make the decision here at
church in Worship in Bible classes I
will not do
X it's not easy it's not fun
self-control isn't a woohoo I'm having a
party I'm self-controlling it's not like
that it's the exact opposite it's not
pleasant it's not what you want number
five up there last one exercise
self-control by avoiding sometimes you
just avoid a situation avoid a
personality you just avoid some things
Romans 16 verse1 17 now I urge you
Brethren note those who cause divisions
and offenses contrary to the doctrine
which you learn and avoid them so
sometimes it's just false teaching there
I don't believe in sensory
I don't believe in that but I do believe
in self- censoring I don't believe in
censoring you do you understand what I'm
saying I don't think it's my place to
censor you to control you to keep you
from being around somebody but I do
think some folks should not be listened
to and I think I must engage in
self-censoring I don't need to listen to
anybody and everybody and I don't need
to believe anybody and everybody I need
to avoid some
things I think that gets us here all
right so exercise self-control by
subjecting that's right you can subject
yourself to yourself ain't that a
strange thing you can subject yourself
to yourself 1 Corinthians 9: 24 begins
this is Paul he said he could do it do
you not know that those who run in a
race all run but one receives the prize
run in such a way that you may obtain it
and everyone who competes for the prize
is notice these words temperate in all
things that means disciplined in all
things if you're an Olympic Athlete you
don't just exercise you control your
diet you control your time everything's
controlled now they do it to obtain a
perishable Crown but we for an
imperishable Crown verse 26 therefore I
run thus not with uncertainty thus I
fight not as one who beats the air but I
discipline my body and bring it into
subjection no you won't do
that lest when I have preached to others
I myself should become disqualified
there's not a sin that you've ever
committed I probably wouldn't enjoy
doing myself right and vice versa
right your body has to be subjected Ed
to biblical ideas and
truths the Bible does not need to be
subjected here's what's happening in our
society now we're trying to control the
society's trying to control the Bible
don't want to hear that push that aside
don't let me hear that anymore here's
the truth if you want to be a better
person that won't help you this will
help you this subjects me I listen to
this and I subject myself to it that'll
change your
life number
next exercise self-control by fleeing
sometimes you just need to run 1
Corinthians 10 and verse4 therefore my
beloved flee from
idolatry you got to stop running toward
Sodom young men stop going to the bar
s stop
it you know you don't get drunk if you
don't go to the bar probably and if you
do get drunk you'll be in your house and
you won't run over
anybody now I know that's not popular
and I know y'all think oh well you're
being restrict no I'm just trying to
help you out I'm I'm trying to teach you
about self-control you can't run toward
a thing and it all work out you can't
run toward sin and it all work out you
got to flee some
stuff number next exercise self-control
by fighting you got to fight it this is
not something that's easy it's not
something that we just automatically are
able to do you got to work at it 1
Timothy 6 verse2 fight the good fight
there is a good fight fight the good
fight of faith and lay hold grab it
strong of eternal life to which we were
also called and have confessed a good
confession in the Pres many stop
wrestling with
Devils start wrestling with
angels too many people are wrestling
with Devils out there and wondering why
they wake up and they're miserable about
what they've done you can't wrestle with
the devil you can't play with it and you
can't be out there you got to fight the
good fight and literally stay away from
that sort of thing because you got
enough within yourself you're struggling
with I promise you and number I guess
it'd be number nine but there's no
numbers up there exercise self-control
by just enduring James 1 and verse 12
says blessed is the man who endures
Temptation what does that mean for when
he has been approved he will receive the
Crown of Life which the Lord has
promised to those who love him here's
the
truth
Temptation and not giving into it is
painful
you got to endure that it's not pleasant
there's not one moment when you're about
to do what you know you shouldn't
do stopping that feels good there's no
part of that that feels good until
later right then it doesn't feel good I
promise you but I'll tell you this
you'll live if you don't do it you won't
die you won't die won't kill you you
will survive and lust does not kill
unless you give into it and then
finally exercise self-control by just
resisting James 4:7 says therefore
submit to God resist the devil and he
will flee from can I tell you something
about the
devil the Devil is a scaredy cat not not
not scared of you and physically or your
p n that's not what I
mean he cannot stand to be
embarrassed he's so proud he can't stand
it and when you resist him you make him
look like a
fool when when he when he thinks he's
got you and you don't give in you
embarrass him he wants to get out of
that room he doesn't want to be
there he doesn't want any part of
that that's the lesson today that's the
summary of it if you missed one of them
and I got to tell you see praying
severing abstaining willing to do it
avoiding fleeing subjecting yourself
fighting against it enduring it and
resisting it all are true I'm not making
any of that up that's all in the Bible
and it all works but I'm telling you
now I struggle with the same things and
I often do not allow the spirit to
encourage me to do that the fruit of the
spirit gives us what we must take by
force this doesn't fall on you
self-control is something you must take
by force and nobody wants to do it at
the moment self-control being
self-controlled exercising self-control
having self-control being strong over
yourself having power over yourself
mastering yourself controlling your mind
having a sound mind using self-restraint
and being sober minded uh-uh see
self-control is given to
us
and we are
willing if we want to be self-controlled
to take it by force we as Christians
with under the influence of the Holy
Spirit want to control ourselves but we
don't want to control
others and we don't want to control
everything if you think Desiring to
control others and everything is the
fruit of the spirit you're mistaken it
is self-control that's the fruit of the
spirit that other is of the
devil we want as Christians to be
responsible especially for our own
selves we want self-control without a
drug we
want to do the right thing but we make
mistakes but will not blame a lack of
self-control on
you it's
me it's me it's me it's me oh Lord
standing in the need of prayer it ain't
my brother it's not my
sister it's
me
man
Cameron hog 31 I don't know if I got
that up there yep I
do killed one of his best friends Asia
wac
21 they're good friends now he's 31
she's 21 she's an athlete he once was
and they had a pickup basketball game
outside she beat
him and they did a lot of trash
talk later that day he drove his truck
to his friend's house at another
location where wac was with a friend
sitting outside watching a football game
so you can tell she's sporty athletic
she's a good basketball player she beat
him that
day when hog got out of his truck wac
stood up and they immediately started
chatting at each other again
so he pulled out a gun and shot her four
times and killed
her her mother Andrea lamented the
killing this is what she said he pulled
up to my house picked her up they drive
together they eat food together they
take phone calls all the time he he
gives him money she gives him money he
she's giving him money to get out of
jail and then you turn around and you
kill her it was senseless for him to
kill his friend over a basketball game
not even the basketball game itself but
the
words that were
spoken after the
game let me tell you the truth there's
not a one of you that controls your
tongue all the
time the hardest thing to control James
chapter
3 amen you
guilty you guilty look at that you can't
even raise your hand to it are you
guilty come on now be honest for once in
your life at church you've been guilty
of saying stuff you know you shouldn't
say raise your
hand selfcontrol
who has a problem with
it who needs the help of the Holy
Spirit who needs to listen to what we
just
read am I there
no but if you think on those things when
it comes you'll do better and we'll
please the Lord amen please the Lord if
you're here today and you never given
your life to the Lord Jesus want to give
you that opportunity we always have an
invitation if you need to repent of your
sins confess the name of Christ and
being baptized today we'll work that out
we'll get that done for you or if you
need to come back to the Lord we'll
always offer prayer for you whatever
your needs are let them be known while
we stand while we
sing
