mm-hmm
good evening church
if you guys were around for Chris Hodges
back in the day he always started off a
sermon like that and I always wanted to
do that before sermon and truthfully 10
10 or so years ago I never thought I
would be up here doing this so I never
thought that I would have a chance
um I want to thank Keegan for asking me
to do this thank the elders for allowing
me to do this I'm super excited to be
here this evening mostly because
this is the youth LED service
and so even though a couple of the
young ones in the youth class told me I
look 43 it makes me feel young that I am
here doing this so thank you
um
the idea behind tonight's lesson
actually came from one of the youth
classes a couple of weeks ago
we were
reading and discussing First Peter
chapter 3 and verse 15.
where it says but sanctify the Lord God
in your hearts and always be ready to
give a defense to everyone who asks you
a reason for the hope that is in you and
Jack and Keegan they did a great job
discussing you know what we believe and
and how to defend it but I didn't say
this in the class but it got me thinking
uh more about the second half of that
verse
and it says a reason for the hope
that is in you
you know what what is Our Hope
does the world see our hope
do they see it through our actions and
reactions do they see it through
our Deeds do they see it through our
attitudes
if we're not any different than the
world
why would we be why would we need to be
ready to give it offense
so I started digging into the hope of a
Christian and how we how we show that
hope and uh to be honest by the end of
preparing this lesson I realized I was
just writing a sermon to myself
um
because I really needed it and I hope
that uh it can bless you guys in some
way tonight let's uh
before we dig in let's start with a
prayer
most gracious Heavenly Father we come to
you now just uh thanking you for this
opportunity father we we thank you for
Jesus and we thank you for what he means
to us father we thank you for the young
men who have stepped up and and led this
evening and we ask that you bless them
father and we ask that uh more will will
see their service and and will want to
do the same
father I ask your blessing as I
dig into the word and and recall what
I've put together that you helped me do
it clearly in a way that they can
understand and hopefully father that
it'll bless somebody
again we thank you for Jesus and we ask
all of this in his name amen
tonight we're going to be talking about
about Lamentations Neil did a great job
with the scripture reading thank you
um
and this was a really a learning uh
experience for me I learned a lot about
prepping a lesson I learned a lot about
uh
delivering a lesson and before this
study I didn't know what a lament was or
is
um but all all five chapters of the book
of Lamentations are are laments they're
a form of prayer expressing sorrow
pain
or confusion
over one third of the book of Psalms
are actually Lament
Jesus lamented in the final hours of his
life by quoting from scripture my God my
God why have you forsaken me
in the book of Lamentations weeps over
the destruction of Jerusalem
and and throughout this study what I've
come to learn
is that I often very often confused hope
with optimism
optimism is an attitude that anticipates
positive
favorable and desirable outcomes I am a
huge Gator fan and every year I just
think we're going to go undefeated we're
going to win the national championship
and then very quickly I'm let down and
we struggle or
actually lose to Vanderbilt but that
optimism every year that I bring to
being a a Gator fan
uh it's not hope it's it's optimism
and the more I dug into this lesson the
more I realized that uh I seem to be
very optimistic about a lot of things
but I don't
hope in those things
biblical biblical hope is different
I'm going to sit this up here
biblical hope is different biblical hope
is is using God's past faithfulness
to motivate hope for the future
we look forward by Looking Backward
trusting nothing other than God's
character
we're going to get into uh verses one to
through 20 a little later if we have
time
um
but I want to want to go back to verse
24 here that Neil read a second ago and
he says therefore I hope in him I plan
to have slides in a in a uh outline for
you guys to follow along with tonight
but my children had other plans this
week and so I didn't get to get those uh
those put together but I do have a title
for the lesson and it's therefore I have
hope
let's look at three little
thoughts
about hope
first one being therefore I have hope in
God's mercy picking up in verse 21 this
I recall to mind
therefore I have hope through the Lord's
mercies we are not consumed
hope is often translated as loving
kindness and in the version the
translation that Neil redded actually
said that uh Psalms 145 and verse 8 says
the Lord is gracious and full of
compassion slow to anger
and great in Mercy
Miriam Webster defines Mercy as
Compassion or forbearance shown
especially to an offender
or to one subject to one's power
the greatest example of God's mercy
is the gift of Grace
extended to us through his son our
savior
Ephesians 2 verses 4 and 5 says but God
who is rich in Mercy out of the great
love with which he loved us even when we
were dead through our trespasses made us
alive together with Christ by Grace you
have been saved
Romans 5 8 says but God demonstrates his
own love towards us and that while we
were still sinners Christ died for us
that is the textbook definition
of Mercy
God is all-powerful we are subject to
his power
we have all sinned
we are offenders and God has shown us
compassion and forbearance for those
transgressions
so you might ask me
Harold see our hope in God's mercies
we can't make such a sacrifice
the world sees Our Hope by us showing
Mercy to others
and by being merciful to those around us
you know I used to think I had this all
figured out
um it's easy to to show love to the ones
that love you right most of the times
most of the times it's easy to love your
family it's easy to love your friends
it's easy to love our children because
they love us back right
Jesus says Nah even Sinners do that
it's easy to do good things for those
who do good things for you
have you ever been walking uh into the
Wawa gas station right down here and two
people get to the door and one opens the
door for for the first one so the other
one hurries up to the next door and
opens it lets them through right we do
that because they just did it for us
right it's easy yeah the world does that
I was going to say Cracker Barrel with
that example but if you get stuck
holding a door at Cracker Barrel you
will be there all day
um
especially Sunday morning right after
church
and Jesus was speaking to me here
and he says she has even even Sinners do
that
it's easy to lend to those from who you
hope to receive back right we work hard
for our money
if I'm going to give you twenty dollars
I want I want that twenty dollars back
and if it's more than that guess what I
I expect some interest for uh letting
you hold on to that
Jesus says no Sinners do that right
that's common business
you know these are all good good things
to do
but what Jesus says in Luke 6 and verse
27 is that
that's not Mercy
let's read that Jesus says love your
enemies love your enemies
do good to those who hate you bless
those who curse you and pray for those
who spitefully use you to him who
strikes you on the One Cheek offer the
other also
and from him who takes away your cloak
do not withhold your tunic either give
to everyone who asks of you and from
whom from from him who takes away your
goods do not ask them back I'm going to
jump down to verse 35 here he says for
he is kind to the unthankful and Evil
therefore be merciful just as your
father also is merciful
if you want to see or if you want the
world to see your hope give them a
glimpse
of God's mercies through your mercies to
those around you
number two
therefore I have hope in God's
faithfulness
picking up in verse 22 it says because
his compassions fail not
they are new every morning great is your
faithfulness not only do we have a
merciful god but we serve
a faithful father
faithful means steadfast and affection
I'm going to focus in here
firm and adherence to promises given
with strong Assurance it's someone that
you can always depend on in all
situations
Malachi 3 and verse 6 says for I am the
Lord I do not change
I don't know about you guys but I've
been promised a lot in life
by people
I've been promised things by Bosses by
co-workers by friends that just didn't
come through
I've been promised promotions and raises
that never happened
I've been promised assistance on tasks
and projects where I was left carrying
the load
and and I've had a number of promises
from friends that never came through
you know but on the flip side of that
I've also made promises
that I can't keep or haven't kept I've
promised to help people and then not
been able to make it
I promise to pray for people and
completely forget to pray
and I've promised to uh
to love my wife unconditionally
and at times I've put conditions around
that love
but praise God
praise God that he's not like that
he is faithful to what he promises us
AA 59 2 tells us that our iniquities
have separated us from God and our sins
have hidden his face from us
Romans 3 verse 23 tells us that all have
sinned and fall short
of the glory of God Romans 6 23 tells us
that the wages of sin
is death
Romans 5 verse 8 tells us again through
God's love while we are still sinner
sinners Christ died for us
Romans 5 verse 9 says that we have now
been justified by his blood and we will
be saved from wrath through Christ
and finally Romans 8 and verse 38 tells
us that neither death nor life neither
angels nor demons neither fears for
today nor worries about tomorrow not
even the power of hell
can separate us from God's love
now I probably shouldn't do this but I'm
going to just assume
that everyone here believes that
if we don't believe that in our hearts
then why why are we here
there's a there's a million other places
that we could be tonight
um
speaking for myself if if I didn't truly
believe what I just read I wouldn't be
up here speaking tonight
probably wouldn't even be here
I wouldn't have accepted a position as a
deacon
I wouldn't mess up my kids bedtime
routines every Wednesday night
I wouldn't have given up the partying
and the drinking
and and truthfully I probably wouldn't
be married right now
but I am
and I do these things because I trust
and I believe when Jesus in Mark 16 16
says he who believes and is baptized
will be saved
but he who does not believe will be
condemned
I feel like
um
a Christian's trust in God is sometimes
opposite to the way humans naturally
trust each other
we trust each other on minor trivial
things
and we trust or we struggle to trust on
larger more critical things your boss
might let you uh handle the easy
day-to-day menial tasks
uh but then wants to watch over your
shoulder every step of the way with the
larger things right
uh you might trust a friend to borrow a
book or a tool but you're going to
really have to think twice when they ask
to borrow your vehicle
and your wife may trust you to bathe the
kids
and get them dressed for church as long
as she picks out what they're going to
wear
in my experience a a Christian's trust
in God
is seems to be the opposite
we we're convinced we're convicted that
that God
through Christ has saved us of our sins
we believe that
we believe that salvation
is ours we believe the gift of eternal
life
is ours
but we struggle to trust them with the
little things
how are we going to get groceries for
the week how are we going to pay the
rent or the mortgage how are we going to
pay the light bill and the water bill
all at the same time
I might be preaching to myself I pray
that's the case but uh for me man I
struggle with this especially with with
finances my truck needs an oil change
Bethany Carr needs looked at there's
doctor's appointments coming up Mason is
eating everything but the kitchen sink
Riley is growing out of her clothes and
her shoes we need to buy a house I want
the girls to go to a private school they
need their own cars eventually and I
will prolong this one as absolutely long
as I can but one day they're going to
get married
and the list of my worries they go on
and on every day
and at times they consume me
uh wondering how am I ever going to be
able to get this done
and unfortunately
those worries they start getting
expressed to your co-workers and they
start getting expressed to your family
and to your friends
and then we're shocked that they don't
want to hear about God
we're shocked that they don't want to
hear about Jesus
this isn't a Prosperity Gospel by any
means
I'm not telling you God will bless you
with everything
that you want all your wants and desires
but what I will tell you is that he will
take care of your needs
Jesus tells us in Matthew 6 verses 31
through 34 therefore do not worry
saying what shall we eat or what shall
we drink or what shall we wear for after
all these things the Gentiles seek
for your heavenly father knows that you
need all these things
but seek first the kingdom of God and
his righteousness and all these things
shall be added to you therefore do not
worry about tomorrow
Paul continues this thought in
Philippians verse 4. or sorry chapter
four
verse 6 says be anxious for nothing
but in everything by prayer and
supplication with Thanksgiving
let your requests be made known to God
13 verses later in verse 19 he says and
my God shall supply all your need
according to his riches in glory
by Christ Jesus
if you want the world to see your hope
show them your trust in God's
faithfulness
for the little things the easy little
things but also things
eternal
number next
I've also always wanted to say that um
but I only have three points it's not
like I forgot where I was
um anyways
therefore uh I have hope in God's
goodness picking up in verse 24 it says
the Lord is my portion says my soul
therefore I hope in him
the Lord is good to those who wait for
him to the soul
who seeks him
uh the Klaus boys the teamers Luke they
have this thing and it's pretty funny
well kind of funny uh
where they'll just kind of stop and say
we'll be in talking whatever and they'll
just stop and say in this pause and
they'll say man look at God right and it
can be it can be silly things right
um young adults will often go out to eat
after Sunday service and if Austin and
Riley have their way we end up at
Chili's and there's 10 to 12 of us who
show up and uh
you know we sit down and before the
server even comes up before they take
our drink order they've got three or
four uh baskets of chips and salsa on
the table and we'll just man look at God
all right silly things
but we also do it on the big things like
you know passing a test or or a new uh
job opportunity that may came up anytime
we just share something good we just
kind of stop and say man look at God
and in my effort to to still feel young
I started doing it
with them
but what I've come to find is that
there's actually a lot of power in that
even even the small silly things it
helps reshift my focus
back to God's goodness
Theologian James Brian Smith defines
goodness as that which works for the
benefit or betterment
of another
he says that which is good makes us
better it heals us it restores us it
improves us it strengthens us
and it makes us right
the Bible
repeatedly tells us that God is good
Nahum 1 verse 7 says the Lord is good
Exodus 34 and verse 6 tells us that his
goodness is abundant
Psalms 23 verse 6 says his goodness is
always with us
and James 1
verse 17 says that every good and
perfect gift is from this from the
father
and we say this to each other all the
time
God is good
and all the time
we we got to do that again
let's try it one more time say it like
you mean it God is good
and all the time
but do we mean that
all the time
you know somebody may come to me or come
to you and say there's so much evil and
sin and suffering in the world how can a
good merciful faithful father
allow this to happen
I hate to tell you I don't have the
answer for that Keegan and I have have
struggled with this many times in uh in
conversation and what I think it boils
down to I won't speak for him but what I
think it boils down to is free will
I think God wants us to choose him
and if it's truly a choice
there has to be an alternative
the alternative is evil and sin we are
choosing God over
the evil and the sin of this world God
does not cause suffering
but he allows us to make a choice
and it's the consequences of our choices
that cause suffering
for ourselves and sometimes for others
you know without suffering in this world
we would never truly
appreciate the blessings and the
goodness
of God
I've even seen this in my own life when
when things are going well when things
are going good I tend to pray less
I tend to thank God less
I start thinking that everything is
going right because of my decisions
because of what I did
and then something goes wrong
and very very quickly I am humbled and I
am right back trains off the tracks I'm
right back to needing Jesus
to needing God into praying to him
asking
for favor
suffering and pain does not mean that
God is not good
but he uses it
suffering can teach us to rely on him
suffering can teach us to trust in him
and suffering can teach us to focus
on him and you know Earthly Earthly
rewards are not
the extent of God's goodness
we're not promised uh easy perfect lives
in fact when Jesus was speaking to the
apostles in Matthew 10 and verse 22 he
says and you will be hated for my by all
for my name's sake
but he who endures to the end will be
saved
second Timothy 2 verse 12 tells us that
if we endure we will also reign with him
and Earthly rewards are great
if you've got money more power to you
if you've got cars and fancy stuff more
power to you thank God
appreciate them
but don't lose focus on the true gift
from God
Romans 6 chapter 6 verses 22 and 23 says
but now that you have been set free
from sin and have become slaves of God
the benefits you read you reap leads to
Holiness and the result is eternal life
for the wage of sin is death but the
gift of God is eternal life in Christ
Jesus
so how can the world see our hope
in God's goodness and in his gift
I would encourage you to set your mind
on things above
look for the good in life
I remember growing up before I could
drive I always wanted to buy a Ford
Explorer
and my older brother drove one and so
it's what I wanted
um wanted to be like him
I'd look online I'd see how much they
cost how much I had to save and as we
were driving around riding around the
car I'd notice that I started to see
more
navy blue Ford Explorers
because that's what I was looking for
in life you see what you look for if you
look for reasons to be angry guess what
you're going to find reasons to be angry
I used to wake up angry
mad at the world mad at myself and I was
looking I was going to find something to
be angry about today
if you look for reasons to be offended
you're going to find somebody who's
going to offend you
but if you look for God's goodness even
in the midst of the evil and the sin in
this world you're going to find it
first Peter 4 verse 12 encourages us and
says beloved do not be surprised
at the fiery trial when it comes upon
you to test you as though something
strange were happening to you
but rejoice
and so far as you share Christ's
suffering that you may also rejoice and
be glad
when his glory is revealed picking up in
verse 16 I want to say yet if anyone
suffers at a Christian let him not be
ashamed but let him glorify God
in this matter
Christian hope is not found in the
absence of suffering
but rather in the presence of God's
spirit
give give glory to God look for the good
in the bad
find the the message find the lesson in
the hard times and share that with
others
foreign
so that's it fairly quick I think I
still went longer than I did last year
um
as Christians we have hope and God's
mercies in God's faithfulness
and God's goodness
um I told you earlier we would get to
verses 1 1 through 20 and
I think we we have time I didn't realize
tonight was a singing Sunday
um
but like I said last time I was up here
it only lasted about 10 minutes so it's
probably good for Keegan to plan
something else
I'm going to read quickly through uh
verses 1 through 19 some believe that
um
some believe that Jeremiah wrote the
book of Lamentations and like I said
earlier it's all about the fall
of Jerusalem
and I want you as we go through these
verses I'm going to read it kind of
quickly
but I want you to hear his thoughts and
how he feels I want you to to feel the
hurt and the anguish that he has
and I encourage you to read them for
yourself as well later on
I know it's 19 verses so I will read
quickly it says I am the man who has
seen Affliction by the rod of his wrath
he has led me and made me walk in
darkness and not in light
surely he has turned his hand against me
time and time again throughout the day
he has aged My Flesh and skin and broken
my bones he has besieged me and
surrounded me with bitterness and woe he
has set me in dark places like the dead
of long ago
he has hedged me in so that I cannot get
out he has made my my chain heavy
even when I cry and I shout he shuts out
my prayer
He has blocked my ways with huge Stone
he has made my paths crooked he has been
to me a bear lying in weight like a lion
an ambush he has turned aside my ways
and torn Me In Pieces he has made me
desolate he has bent his bow and set me
up as a target for the arrow
he has caused the arrows of his quiver
to pierce my loins
I have become the ridicule of all my
people their taunting song all the day
he has filled me with bitterness he has
made me drink wormwood he has also
broken my teeth with gravel and covered
me with ashes
you have moved my soul far from peace
I've forgotten prosperity
and I said my strength and My Hope have
perished from the Lord
remember my Affliction in roaming
roaming the wormwood in the gal my soul
still remembers and sinks Within Me
I want you to listen to this next part
this I recall to my mind
therefore I have hope
have you ever felt like that
have you ever felt
that God's not around
have you ever felt that everybody else
is getting the blessing
and
you've been left out
I have
and despite feeling all of that
the writer says I see your mercy
I see your faithfulness and I see your
goodness I choose
to Hope in you
verse 26 says it is good that one should
hope and wait quietly for the Salvation
of the Lord
salvation's coming
we don't know when but it's coming
the things that we go through in this
life the suffering the struggles that we
have
we will never think of them again
the hope that we have the gift
is for everyone
and if you're here tonight and you've
not given your CR life to Christ there's
a chance to repent of your sins
confess the name of Jesus and be
baptized for the remission of your sins
and the hope
of eternal life if you need to come come
now while we stand and sing
