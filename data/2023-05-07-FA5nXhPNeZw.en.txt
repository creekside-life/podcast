you know doing better than others in
worship is kind of the motivation behind
our
text the
desire that's the desire of the
Samaritan woman here she's been caught
out with her
sin with these
men trying to draw attention away from
that she wants to somehow come across as
superior to the
Jews that's what this
is that's the essence behind this text
this desire to compare ourselves with
each other so that I'm one up above
you or you're one up above me especially
as it relates to them in
worship there was a study done I used
this several years ago but I thought it
was a study that would be interesting to
bring back up again there was a study
done at Harvard uh several years ago
where they asked the students these
questions and this was the question
which would you prefer a job where you
made 50,000 a year that's option b this
is years ago 50,000 a year excuse me
that's option A or where you made
100,000 a year that's option b so this
is several years ago so now that's easy
right you know which one you're going to
choose you got a choice of 50,000 or
100,000 you going to take the 100,000 so
everyone should take option b but then
there was a
catch in option A the students would get
paid twice as much as others who would
only get 25,000 so you would make 50,000
but everybody else that would work with
you would only make
25,000 in option b they would get paid
100,000 but all the other people that
you would work with would be paid
200,000 so option b would make the
students more money
overall but they would be doing worse
than all of their friends around
them what do you think the majority
chose they chose option A even though
they weren't making as much money they
would be making twice as much money as
everybody around
them we want to compare and look
good even in our worship we may are
compare
our worship with Theirs to be
better it's not really a wise thing to
do a lot of comparing 2 Corinthians 10
and verse 12 they measure themselves by
themselves and compare themselves among
themselves and are not Wise It's not
wise to do that it's actually a sign of
weakness we must humbly realize that
that God as a good father loves us for
us and not for what we've done or for
our abilities or our intelligence or our
righteousness or our
worship but as a good father loves his
children someone said we dare not
compare ourself to anyone for We Are All
One of a
Kind someone else said I need to just be
me everyone else is already taken
anyway someone else said we should not
compare our worship to
theirs for we never know the truth about
anyone else but
us and we are sometimes wrong about
us it can be
serious a very serious thing to compare
your worship with someone
else's now it's not the idea of doing it
is
not but our reaction to it can be very
serious a good example of that is
Genesis Chapter 4 verses 4-5 where
Abel offered an offering to the Lord and
Cain offered an offering to the Lord and
verse four it says the Lord respected
Abel in his offering okay verse five but
he did not respect Cain in his
offering Cain didn't really give it his
all I guess didn't do it right and then
it says and Cain was very angry ended up
killing his brother over
it so comparing your worship with
someone else actually could be
dangerous in mythical me rella uh
parman Begins by telling of a single
event that led uh her down a particular
Journey on this how she compared herself
particularly with other women and so she
wrote about that she said that she'd
gone to this lady's Retreat like thing
and when she came home she's talking to
her husband about her lady's Retreat she
said well Belinda is so kind and
friendly I wish I had her sense of humor
then she switched I wish I could be more
like an she's incredibly organized and
then she changed she says boy it would
be nice to be like Shannon she's so
poised and beautiful I wish I had her
posture and carriage her husband been
listening this the whole time
interrupted her and said
Rella you compare yourself with everyone
you meet
you pick out the best attributes of each
person and measure how you stack up
against them now that already rankled
her by the way gentlemen don't generally
interrupt your wife when she's talking
like this so is already a little
wrinkled and then what he said next
really upset her he said you've created
for yourself a mythical composite
woman and you think she's the standard
you should meet but that woman ladies
does not
exist you're fine like you
are some compare with
others churches did you know
that well I had this experience over
here I had this one so they compare the
preachers please don't do
that or the singing please please don't
do
that or the
programs please don't do
that you start
comparing because ultimately if you're
not careful the motivation behind that
is to belittle one and exalt
another especially if they're just
trying to please the
lord it's a dangerous path and I'm
certainly not worthy to be on the group
to be
compared I'm just one of you standing up
here so in our text Jesus uses four
antithetical well antithetical means
basically directly opposed or contrasted
shifts in a just a few words so we want
to look at just those few words this
really simple lesson we're going to look
at just a few of those Concepts and then
the lesson will be
yours now stop oh there we go number
one
on versus in now that's not as
significant in the Greek by the way but
that's the way your versions
predominantly translated on this
mountain versus in
Jerusalem John chapter 4 he says in
verses 2 he says our fathers worshiped
on this mountain Mount garam and you
Jews say that it's in Jerusalem on Mount
marah is a place where one ought to
worship on versus in Jesus said to
Heroman believe me the hour is coming
when you will neither on this mountain
nor in Jerusalem worship the father on a
mountain versus in a temple you know
some think it's on a river or a lake
or a mountain versus in a church
building especially with half the lights
off Matthew
24 veres 1 and 2 says then Jesus went
out and departed from the temple and his
disciples came up to show him the
buildings of the temple as if Jesus need
his disciples to showing the buildings
of the temple verse two and Jesus said
to them do you not see all the these
things that's an interesting question
assuredly I say to you not one stone
shall be left here upon another that
shall not be thrown down and if you see
a picture of it today you know that was
fulfilled not one stone left upon
another you know it's
funny
places nor the beauty of a
facility are to be used as a
comparison hope I got your
attention it's dangerous for
us right now in this
building to do just
that Jesus used an antithetical shift in
our thinking on versus in and he rejects
them
both
number
next you versus we he does something
interesting here you worship what you do
not know versus we know what we
worship John 4:22 says you worship what
you do not know we know you we you we
you we we know what we worship for
salvation is of the Jews you do not know
versus we know you versus
we you versus
we some think it's you versus me or
we that somehow one of us is
special he knows stuff the others don't
know it's got a special connection the
rest of us don't
have like somehow you're special the way
you worship but I'm
not or I'm special the way I worship but
you're not so I make a connection and
you don't or you make a connection and I
don't you ever been talked to like that
been talked to like that many
times you we Ephesians 2 verse 14 the
theme of the scriptures is this for he
himself that is Jesus is our peace who
has made both one the you and the We Are
One
now and has broken down the middle Wall
of Separation having abolished in his
flesh the enmity that is in the law of
Commandments contained in ordinances so
as to create in himself one new man that
is Jew Gentile there's no two different
people now from the two thus Making
Peace verse 16 that he might reconcile
them both to both to God in one body
through the cross this is the one body
through the cross thereby putting to
death the enmity and he came and
preached peace to you who are far off
and to those who were near Verse 18
finally says this for through
him we not just you and me you versus we
but we together both have access by one
Spirit you see
uh
races that's what we're talking about in
this text the Samaritans versus the Jews
it's basically two different races of
people two different cultures races nor
special access to certain places are to
be
used as a
comparison it's dangerous for
us because what it does is it limits our
unity and there's not to be a limit to
our
Unity Jesus said as an antithetical
shift in is
thinking you versus
we is going
away it's going away why do we keep
using
it and then it's n versus n did you pick
up on that there's an N versus n it's
not so critical in the Greek but it's
obviously in the English in Jerusalem
versus in spirit and Truth there is a
shift coming coming in Jerusalem versus
in spirit and truth that's what he
brings up in verses 21 and 23 it says in
21 Jesus said to her woman believe me
the hour is coming when you will neither
worship on this mountain nor in
Jerusalem worship the father verse 23
but the hour is coming and now is when
the true worshippers will worship the
father in spirit and Truth for the
father is seeking such to worship Him
versus in Jerusalem being that special
place to in spirit being that special
place and in truth so in a Jewish temple
versus in spirit and truth and in your
heart some still think it's in a place
or in a group that it only real worship
only happens in a certain place or in a
certain
group
be
careful and not in spirit and
truth because if it's in spirit and
truth you can't tell all that's doing
that and you have no knowledge of
it because spirit's not something we can
see
Philippians CH 3 veres 2-8 I'll just
spot read here beginning in verse three
for we are the circumcision who worship
God in spirit and rejoice in Christ
Jesus and have no confidence in the
flesh that's a that's big stuff there if
you really listen to what he's saying
verse four though I also might have
confidence in the flesh if anyone else
thinks he may have confidence in the
flesh I more
so circumcised a Hebrew of Pharisee
blameless verse 7 but what things were
gained to me these I've counted loss for
Christ yet indeed I also count all
things lost for the Excellency of the
knowledge of Christ Jesus my
Lord It's not the
flesh it's not the
nation and it's not the
set it's not the culture it's not the
place America's not the
there is no place like
that and we are not to use such as
comparisons it's dangerous to
think
that we do the true
worship as if it's something we
do the problem with that is we think
that's
corporate and yes we're to worship
corporately but but what happens in this
room may not have any bearing on what
happens with inside of
you so it's dangerous to think well I'm
in the right group and we're all doing
it the right way and so everything's
honky
Dory when your mind hadn't been on
anything we've talked about this morning
and right now you can't stand what's
going on and you can't wait to get out
of this
room so don't tell me well I'm in the
Church of Christ we do it has nothing to
do with that what's going on inside of
you see that's where it happens there's
not a place it's not over here in this
building or that
building so what are you
doing where you
are well we do it right over here well
great that's wonderful but do you do it
right over
there n versus n so Jesus uses an
antithetical shift in our thinking from
in versus
in you thought it was in here it's not
in here it's in
here so it's will versus
must in John chap 4: 23- 24 he Compares
will which is
a command to do his will
will versus
must a must if you do it it's a must to
you then it has something to do with
something that happened inside of you a
changed heart a change mindset listen to
you read it again verse 23 see familiar
passages should be read more closely
don't you think verse 23 but the hour is
coming and now is when the true
worshipper
will worship the father and hadn't
happened quite yet but it's it's right
there at the Verge we'll talk about that
in a minute will worship the father in
spirit and Truth for the father is
seeking such to worship Him verse 24 God
is spirit and those who worship Him must
worship Him in spirit and in truth
there's an urgency within the true
worshippers I don't know if you're
getting it so there's the will worship
the ones that do because it's
commanded and then there's another kind
of worshipper you must do
it I've got to do
this some think it's will worship
Commandments and not changed Hearts but
Colossians 2 verse 20 says if you be
dead with Christ from the rudiments of
the world why is though living in the
world are you subject to ordinances
touch not taste not handle not which all
are listen to this statement which all
are to perish at some point you shift
from being a commandment keeper to
someone who
must do the right thing who must worship
God which all are to Parish with the
using of after the Commandments and
doctrines of men which things are indeed
a show of wisdom in will
worship and humility and neglect of the
body but not in any honor to the
satisfying of the flesh it really
doesn't have anything to do with your
heart you can do all you can keep the
Commandments and it never be a changed
heart you can do it I've done it you can
do
it not Wills or commands versus
sincerity and that even shouldn't be a
com comparison it's
dangerous it's dang dangerous because
then now I'm comparing myself with you
it's actually
dangerous he's doing it because it's the
will of God and I'm doing it because of
a changed heart now it's back to what I
was condemning at the beginning of this
lesson it's back to boo boo I can Bish
it better than you
can or we do it right y'all don't do it
right over
y That's the whole lesson
have we so focused on comparisons and
and I know probably nobody here does
that y'all don't compare yourself you
don't even compare what they're wearing
versus what you're wearing that doesn't
happen
here but over at that other Church where
they do
that cuz they're just not as good as
us have we so focused on comparisons to
make sure that we're right and others
are wrong cuz we got to go to heaven we
don't care if they'd make it but we're
going to go to
heaven that we've missed the Simplicity
of just worshiping God in
spirit some still think it's on a river
or a lake or a mountain and that's where
I really worship God some think it's
only in a
church some think it's you versus
we and we're special and we know stuff
and you
don't some think it's in a place or in a
group or even in a race for that matter
and we're the ones who are in spirit and
in truth some think it's will worshiping
those commands and getting them right
versus a chain spirit and a heart that's
in
it are not all churches subject to this
and I'm using that in the broadest sense
of the term
Church not all churches
competitive and aren't you the what
we're compete competing
for is that not it is't that what it
kind of feels like we're all just
competing for you you're the
customers an't that kind of
disgusting doesn't that feel
wrong church is subject to this
competitive thing so I we've got to have
a better sign than everybody body else
we got to have a better worship than
everybody else we'll gather them more
but we get the right guy up there in the
pull pit boy I've heard this said to
many times which one day you'll have the
right guy I'm sure but one day when we
get that right guy then we're just going
to explode we're going to do stuff
then to win because ultimately what
we're now talking about is I got to win
I got to
win and not that because my team's going
to win we're back to rooting for a
football team instead of
church be the only ones
right to get the people on our
side why not just try to get on God's
side and his spirit and his truth you
know comparing doesn't actually always
work it doesn't always tell you
something really doesn't always tell you
anything so you can compare apples and
oranges but you don't really don't
always tell you something for example my
wife has survived three
C-sections okay I might say I've
survived three C-sections too they were
traumatic for me as well so what were
they like well I'm not going to get into
the nitty-gritty here but I'll give you
a little bit our first child was Heath
he was a
problem and so we had to have an
emergency C-section we didn't know this
was going to happen it was emergency d c
section and so she was asleep so I got
to see ugly little oh Heath
first and she was like two three hours
later before she woke up to see him well
that's one
C-section second C-section was the
easiest C-section of all for Mama and
for baby okay I was sick I had I was
like had to flu or something strep
throat or something I was feeling
miserable but it all went well other
than in the blood it was
great third
C-section Mama nearly died I nearly died
Bethany was fine she's great what I
learned from all that absolutely
nothing
nothing except that I'm glad they're all
alive they're all
healthy I didn't learn anything and
comparing them doesn't make any sense at
all I love each one of them I'm grateful
my wife's around and so this idea well
comparison will teach you something no
it doesn't do always teach anything so
you busy comparing everything some of
you compare everything everything is a
competition everything is comparison
please please understand it that's not
wise you know it's it's not always
beneficial in
1975 in 1975 fellow Nam Charlie Chapman
was still alive Charlie Chapman was
still alive in
1975 and he decided he in France he was
in France and he decided he'd enter a
lookalike contest for Charley
Chapman he came in
third he enjoyed
it he didn't look like Charlie
Chapman imagine if Jesus were here today
which church would he worship
at is that where we're
at would he
decide we weren't doing
right it's funny how we go down that
pathway isn't it we have to be the
winners focus on worshiping God oh I
need to tell you about who the
worshippers are you want to who to know
who they are do you want to know I bet
you
don't you see you read this passage all
your life right and you thought you knew
what it's talking about it's talking
about us our
church well
actually in a vague
way and in a very serious way it's
not you see the first true
worshipper
went on the Mount of
Olives separated from the
12 then separated from the
three and went out all by
himself then in
tears and Agony he knelt
down and he began true worshipper and
what is true
worship I don't want this I don't want
like what's happening in my life right
now
father please don't let this
happen but you're still my God and I
will do whatever you want me to
do that's true worship but it's not true
worship until you actually do it and so
he walked up gath's hill and he laid
down on that Rugged Cross and they
nailed him to it
that's true worship how does yours
compare you sure you want to
compare because all this other stuff is
not really true
worship that's
it serving the lord when it makes you
miserable and you do it
anyway you didn't think it was going
there did you so this invitation is for
all of you who think life is wonderful
and you've never had
trouble to be a true
worshipper to follow the lord when he
makes you
miserable serve him with all your heart
anyway repenting of your sins confessing
the name of Christ and being
baptized if that's the call you're
willing to listen to then the invitation
is yours while we stand and while we s
