th Huxley was a well-known
agnostic he was with a group of men one
weekend I don't know what their group
meeting was about but they were away
somewhere and on the Sunday all the men
in this group itself SE Huxley was very
religious they were all getting ready
Sunday morning to go to church somewhere
else and uh Huxley was not planning to
go to church obviously he's an
agnostic but but there was a gentleman
there who was of pretty great Christian
character in his mind and Huxley asked
him even though he's a diagnostic he
says uh suppose you stay home with me
today and not go to
church and would you spend that time and
tell me why you are a
Christian well the gentleman knowing
that Huxley was brilliant man he was
hesitant he said uh I can't ma match my
wits with
yours you'll outsmart me tangle me up if
this is about an argument I don't think
I
should but then Huxley said I don't want
to argue with you I really just want you
to tell me simply what this Christ means
to you will you stay and do that for me
seem
sincere so the man
stayed and the Man spent the time
telling Huxley and agnostic what Christ
meant to
him and when he
finished Huxley was in
tears his eyes were full and it was
running down his
face and hugley with his eyes full of
tears
said I hear
you I would give my right hand if I
could only believe believe
that evangelist Gypsy Smith tells a
story about when a group of gypsies were
forced across a
swollen stream that had become a a
torrential River at the that moment and
a great number of them ended up being
drowned as they attempt attempted to
cross that raging
River a young man made a desperate
attempt to save his
mother but when he was trying to save
his mother you know a little bit about
this probably and it even be taught
about this that when someone
panics and they won't let you you almost
can't help
them and so she kept clinging to him in
a way that was taking them both
down and several times he had to push
her
away and he'd say let go mother and I
can save you if you'll let go of
me but she would not hate him she was in
panic and she ended up being
drowned at the funeral a son said over
and over he stood and spoke these words
over and over again how hard I tried to
save you
mother but you wouldn't let
me many we try to
help will not let
us let us never be okay though with
it let us never be okay with not
reaching any people or any people group
for
Christ let's never be okay with the fact
that about two billion people are still
totally unreached in the world today of
8 billion people
sure billions believe in
Jesus but about 2 billion people are
totally
unreached
90% of those unreached live in countries
that are resistant to the gospel to the
point you could go to jail virtually for
speaking about him but let us never be
okay with
that and let us never give in to that
let us never be okay with the fact that
494 th000 towns and villages in India
have have no presence of any church of
any sort no matter what you call
it not any sign of a church
495,000
Villages not
people let's never be happy with that
let's never be okay with that and why we
cannot help everyone which this lesson
will
affirm because we have
limitations let's think about those
limitations because you can run a 100
yard dash and by the way I am so slow
that your child would probably beat me
at a 100 yard
dash I think I ran it in 16 seconds one
time something that was my fastest okay
so 100 yard dash and you can wear a
snowsuit and run a 100 yard dash but if
you wear a snowsuit in 100 yard dash you
will not win any
races but you can take the snowsuit off
you can dress
appropriately and run a better race and
that's what I would call us to
today our text reveals at least five of
our
limitations that we need to examine I
think we need to seriously examine our
limitations
always so this lesson will be on the one
hand make you comfortable Will Comfort
you a little bit on the other hand it
intends to challenge you so I hope to do
both comfort those who are uncomfortable
and challenge those who are a little too
comfortable let's look at it from just
simple lessons here one of the reasons
that we have limitations is we have
limited
missions it says verse 5 and six this is
the mission that Jesus was giving them
verse five these 12 Jesus sent out and
commanded them saying do not do not do
not go into the way of the Gentiles
that's a limit and do not enter a city
of the Samaritans that was a limit so
that's two limits right there but go
rather to the lost sheep of the House of
Israel so he put limits on their
missions now what's is that still the
case in Matthew 10:23 says when they
persecute you in this city flee to
another for assuredly I say to you you
will not have gone through the cities of
Israel before the son of man comes so
even giving them this limited amount
they didn't finish the job did you get
that they didn't even finish that job
and it was a very limited job now Mark
16:15 says and he said into them going
into all the world preach the gospel to
Every Creature right so that's our
mission Mission but that isn't your
mission because you can't cover the
entire world you can only cover what's
your mission at this moment that's it
you can't go to Bangladesh
today you can't go to South America
today right your mission that's in front
of you we have a limited Mission at any
given moment yes our mission is to go
the whole world as a
group but we have a limited Mission as
an individual there are many limits to
our mission look at some of them I have
them listed in front of you there I our
missions are limited by our
schedules we've only got so much time
Psalm 90:10 the Days of Our Lives are 70
years if it's soon cut off and we fly
while might be three score and 10
but and you know you only got so much
time you've noticed that right bet some
of you have started noticing Gray cares
Colossians 4: 5 Redeeming the
time you need to pay attention to the
fact that you've only got so much time
you've got a limited Mission you can't
go to the whole world you can't talk to
everybody on the planet our missions are
limited by our
soils the people we're dealing with in
Matthew 13:14 hearing you will hear and
shall not understand and seeing you will
see and shall not perceive there are
people you could talk to all day long
and it's like talking to to a a brick
wall our missions are limited by our
skills Matthew I mean acts 18:24 Apollos
was an eloquent man and mighty in the
scriptures I'm a hick from
Alabama I've never been skillful in
speech most of you know it you listen to
me you can tell I can't even pronounce
pronounce so I
mean I mean I I I don't have it
I mean you some of you look in this
church over and saying well where's your
real preacher I get
it there's limited skills but you have
limited skills as well we all do some of
us are really good at this or that but
not necessarily desend
that Colossians 4:3 our missions are
limited by our spaces Colossians 4:3
meanwhile praying also for us that God
would open to us a door for the word to
speak the mysteries of Christ here's the
truth there's only certain opportunities
and spaces where we can
speak everything's not open to us like I
said some countries don't want us
right our missions are limited by our
seasons 2 Timothy 4:2 preach the word be
ready in season and out of season what
does that refer to well it refers to a
lot of things but let me just give one
that you already know teenagers are a
great Mission field how many times we
baptize teenagers and young people as
they come across but have you noticed
that once they become teenagers often
right often they get into their 20s and
they're off to college and they forget
that they ever went to
church yes
Seasons someone above 80 how many you
seen baptized over 80
Seasons so yeah there are limits because
of our limitations we cannot help
everyone we have limits and one of them
is our
Missions Number Two we have limited
messages it says and as you go preach
saying the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand
now we're not really told to preach that
now I'll get to that in a minute but but
even then when they were told to preach
that you know they didn't really know
what they were talking about
they had some Concepts they didn't even
really understand what they were
preaching Jeremiah 1 ver7 whatever I
command you you shall speak right so
where's to speak whatever God says right
Mark 16:15 and he said to them go into
all the world and preach the gospel to
Every Creature so that's our assignment
preach the gospel to Every Creature but
as you know the gospel is not just one
package yes it's the death and bual
resurrection of Christ it's the cross
yes but it's it's also Faith yes but
it's Grace yes but it's uh love and so I
mean there's different packages of it
right and different ways to say it there
are many limits to our
messages our messages are limited by our
Frailty I wish we weren't frail but we
are Matthew 23:4 for they bind heavy
burdens hard to bear and lay them on men
shoulders but they themselves will not
move them with one of their fingers what
that suggests to me is that we all have
burdens we all have frailties we're not
all fixed up oh we look like it we come
to church we we act like we're all fixed
up but we're not all fixed up we've got
problems each one of us got our own
weirdness a little strange you do
something strange anybody else in the
church knew you did that they go boy
that's
peculiar we all have frailties and our
messages are limited by our spirituality
we're not all at the same level
spiritually in John 16: 12-13 it says I
still have many things to say to you but
you not cannot bear them now however
when in other words you're not even
spiritual enough to handle the message
I'm trying to give you right now however
when he the spirit of Truth has come he
will guide you into all truth he's going
to help you grow up a little more for he
will not speak on his own authority but
whatever he hears he will speak and he
will tell you things to come the truth
is is that in any given moment I'm not
not full and you're not either I'm empty
in some area right now
spiritually I'm probably empty and so I
don't know it I think I'm all there you
know but then something comes up and I'm
realiz
um I'm empty in some places so when I
can help somebody I'm not always ready
to help
somebody spiritually and then our
messages are limited by our maturity in
1 Corinthians chap 3: 1 and 2 it says '
and I Brethren could not speak to you as
a to spiritual people but as to carnal
as to babes in
Christ well I've been in the church 30
years you can be the biggest baby 30y
old baby you've ever seen I fed you with
milk and not with solid food for until
now you were not able to receive it and
even now you're still not
able quite honestly and this is the
truth and listen
carefully I'm not as mature
as you probably think I
am and neither are
you so our messages are limited by our
maturity because of our limitations we
cannot help everyone for we have limited
messages we make send out
messages Kingdom of Heaven is at hand
and we often don't even know what we're
saying
number three we have limited methods now
in this text look at the methods to
reach the loss that they had look at
this this is a goal mine would that I
had these methods verse eight heal the
sick it wouldn't be a sick person in
here today
amen cleanse the
lepers wow raise the
Dead cast out
demons I don't know which one of you'd
have to go
freely you have received freely
give
wow I've never done any of those things
have
you I don't have that
method 1 Corinthians 3:8 Love Never
Fails but where there are prophecies
they will fail prophecy was coming to an
end where there were tongues they will
cease speaking in tongues was coming to
an end where there was knowledge it will
vanish away special prophetic knowledge
was going to end we don't have that now
those would be great
methods the Earth was
created six days God rested on the
seventh he didn't keep
creating Moses got the law on Mount
Si and then they left
SI and they didn't even believe they can
take on
Giants Jesus performed Miracles even
raised didn't even rose from the
dead and the early church stumbled but
the early church performed Miracles but
then the churches you see it today it's
pretty
bazan not a lot of Miracles happening
are
there there are many limits to our
methods
today our methods are limited by our
helpfulness quite honestly one of the
major reasons that our methods aren't
that great is because we're not
necessarily willing to be all that
helpful in Matthew 25:35 and 36 says for
I was hungry and you gave me food that's
a
work I was thirsty and you gave me drink
that's a work you got to want to do it I
was a stranger and you took me in
somebody you didn't even know and you
took me in your house had to work that's
scary work I was naked and you clothed
me well that's what you wanted to do I
was sick and you visited me going to see
somebody that's
sick uh I'm afraid I'll get it I was in
prison and you came to me what are they
going to think about me going to see
that people in prison see you you if you
don't want to be helpful you won't
be our methods are limited by our our
earnestness how sincere are we oh I'm
I'm
sincere well at any given moment I might
be listen to Romans 12: 6-8 having then
gifts differing according to the grace
that is given to us let us use them if
prophecy let us because the tendency is
to not do it let us prophesy in
proportion to our faith huh verse seven
or Ministry let us use it in our
ministry he who teaches in teaching uh
he who exhorts in exhortation he who
gives with liberality he who leads with
diligence he who shows Mercy with
cheerfulness my heart is not always in
what I really ought to be
doing and I'm not unique
there our methods are limited also by
our preparedness am I ready to teach
this person or to work with this person
or to help this person or to sit down
and talk with this am I even ready to
sit on the edge of the well and talk to
the Samaritan woman am I ready
emotionally psychologically spiritually
am I ready to do it Ephesians 4: 11 and
12 says and he himself gave some to be
Apostles some prophets and some
evangelists and some pastors and
teachers and here's why for the
equipping of the Saints for the work of
the ministry for the edifying of the
body of Christ so the truth is is that
my Zeal Fades from time to time is
yours so because of our limitations we
cannot help everyone for we have limited
methods methods that we're simply not
willing to try at
times number next we have limited money
y'all already knew this one didn't you I
bet you could look in your bill phone
and figure that one out it says verses 9
and 10 for neither go provide neither
gold nor silver or comper in your money
belt money belts that's tells you how
dangerous it was in their part of the
country you have to wear a money belt
verse 10 nor bags for your journey nor
two tunics nor sandals nor stals for
worker is worthy of his food God will
bless you yes he will provide what you
need to do the work yes that's what he's
saying uh but some of
us actually are the ones who need to be
helped so how does that work
out
there are many limits to our
money and anybody who doesn't
recognizing that is trying to sell you
something any preacher that's trying to
tell you oh if you just give it all
you'll just have it all you'll never
hear me say that because it's not true
number
one but ultimately you got to give what
you believe God's leading you to give
there are many limits in our money our
money is limited by our prosperity and
we're not at the same level anybody says
you're all we're all there we're not all
there we're not all at the same level
prospering 1 Corinthians 16:2 that we
read all the time in giving it says this
on the first day of the week let each
one of you lay something inside storying
up as he may Prosper not just giving it
it has to be according to what you've
been prospered 2 Corinthians 8:12 says
it is accepted according to what one has
and not according to what he does not
have you're not supposed to give what
you don't have this idea about borrowing
money to put in the collection plate is
crazy you don't do that if you've been
told to do that shame on whoever told
you to do that could you use more sure
could we as a church use more yeah we
got three more buildings to build yeah
but I ain't going to lie to you to get
you to give it that's not going to
happen we're not going to do that our
money is limited by our purposing 2
Corinthians 9:7 so let each one give as
he purpose you have to decide what
you're going to do as he purposes in his
heart not grudgingly or of necessity for
God loves a cheerful Giver really
purposing is not getting to the passing
the plate and say oh here we go that's
not purposing purposing is thinking
about your finances considering your
budget looking it over can I afford to
do that that's what purposing is and our
money is limited by our priorities it
says Matthew 15: 4-6 it says for God
commanded saying honor your father and
your mother and he he who curs his
father or mother let him be put to death
but you say whoever says to his father
or mother whatever Prophet you might
have received from me as a gift to God
then he need not honor his father and
mother thus you have made the
Commandment of God of no effect by your
Traditions well what is it saying there
he saying that you violated the concept
of that first before you give you're
supposed to take care of the people in
your family before you put a penny in
the collection
plate are you hearing me
you feed your
family and it's not the church's
responsibility to take care of your
grandma it's your responsibility to take
care of
grandma it's your responsibility to take
care of your cousin your brother your
sister that's you that's on you and
you're to do that first before you put a
penny in here this idea about well I got
to take care uh the church first no no
no no no you got that backward let me go
further 1 Timothy 5:8 but if any does
not provide for his own and especially
for those of his household he's denied
the faith and is worse than an
unbeliever so yeah get it get your
priorities straight so there are many
limits to our finances our money because
of limitations we cannot help everyone
we have limited money and finally this
is the last
point we have limited mindsets let's
just read this passage this verses uh
11- 16 maybe now whatever city or town
you enter inquire who is worthy in it
and stay there till you go out and when
you go into a household greet it that's
Shalom uh peace be to you the household
is worthy let your peace your Shalom
come upon it but if it is not worthy let
your peace return to you don't say that
verse 14 and whoever will not receive
you nor hear your word when you depart
from the house or city shake off the
dust from your feet oh that sounds mean
verse 15 assuredly I say to you it will
be more tolerable for the land of Sodom
and gamor in the day of judgment than
for that City wow uh beh behold I send
you out a sheep in the midst of wolves
therefore be wise as serpents and
harmless as doves here here's the simple
Point don't be in a hurry to dust off
your
shoes we must take care to not judge
others unworthy too
quickly we must take care to not become
unpleasant people
ourselves that have no peace ourselves
we must take care to not be so
sensitive that somebody says something
just not right to us and we decide to
hit hit them with all we've
got to be clear we need to yes shake off
the dust against someone who's
absolutely unwilling to hear anything
yes but we are to be as docile as sheep
and to be as harmless as doves to be as
docile as sheep not as aggressive as
wolves to be as harmless as doves and
not like a bunch of poisonous snakes I'm
afraid that sometimes our evangelism
looks a lot like I'm going to get you
be
careful that's not to be
us there are many limits to our mindsets
our mindsets are limited by our
inflexibility we we sometimes we're just
inflexible 1 Corinthians 9 verse 22 to
the weak I became as weak I bet you
heard this before that I might win the
weak I became all things to all men that
I might by all means say something I've
been here about 27 years now a little
little more
more you ought to know my faults by now
those of you been here for the 27 years
God bless you you did get to go to
heaven probably for that 27 years
now and you know me so you know my
attitude is not always
right sometimes I'm
inflexible but I know
you and sometimes your attitude is
inflexible our mindsets are limited by
our
offensiveness it says in 1 Corinthians
10 give no offense either to the Jews or
the Greeks the Church of God just as I
also please all men in all things not
seeking my own profit but the profit of
many that they may be saved don't be
offensive yes does the dust off your
shoes yeah but don't be
offensive our mindsets are limited by
our
argumentativeness Romans 14 ver1 receive
one who is weak in the faith but not to
disputes over doubtful things some folks
like to argue about
everything I do it's a
problem second Timothy 2:14 charging
them before the Lord do not strive about
words to no profit to the ruin of the
hearers don't get in Arguments for
nothing I nonsense are limited by our
self-centeredness Romans 15:1 we then
who are strong ought to Bear the
Scruples of the weak and not to please
ourselves if we are so spiritually
strong quit beating other people down
talk to
them so that's the lesson simple little
lesson but it is a truth that we cannot
help everyone and the reason one of the
major reasons we cannot help everyone is
because of
our limits I have
limits I have limits in my mission I can
only reach this or that and so can you
uh we have limited messages my message
isn't clear always to this one or that
one we have limited methods I can't
raise the
dead we have limited money we don't
we're not able to just build anything
anywhere we want anytime we want want
any any type it would look like we want
we have limited mindsets some of the
biggest limits are what's going on in
here so maybe some will never be reached
because of my limitations have you ever
thought that
through wonder how many people won't go
to heaven because of my
limits you ever thought that one through
how many have I run
off instead of
winning how many have I harmed instead
of
blessing yeah that one keeps me up at
night so maybe some will never be
reached because of my limitation because
of your
limitations but
maybe stop with me just a second let's
rewind go
backwards maybe we only need to
hide and bury my
limits to reveal the high way of Christ
maybe the trick is not overcoming all of
my limits because maybe that's not
possible maybe I will always have limits
and you will always have limits and
therefore that's always going maybe the
trick is not to be perfect in the way we
present the gospel to everybody maybe
the trick is to just hide
me hide me
savior hide me in the cleff of The Rock
where they don't even notice me they
don't even see me maybe it's hiding
me St Petersburg
Russia was laid out uh back in the 18th
century St Petersburg it's a new city
18th century and they laid it out and
when they were laying it out the there
had been a big Glacier from Finland had
come down many years before and it had
left these giant Boulders bigger than
this platform I mean Boulders sitting
there just sitting there on the ground
big giant rock just laying there and so
when they laid out the streets one of
the main streets had one of the biggest
Boulders in the way I mean it was like
giant they were able to get the others
moved away and go work around them but
they had this one the Main Street to
this day of St
Petersburg there was a gigantic Boulder
in the way so they put out bids the Town
Council who were going to do all this is
let's set out bid see if we can get that
done because there was no such thing as
dynamite in this day they didn't have
Dynamite they didn't have any big Earth
moving equipment they didn't have
anything like that so what are you going
to do so the bids came back oh they were
enormous the bids were diculous
expensive there was just no way finally
a little peasant guy comes in and he
presents his bid and it was like nearly
nothing and they were like well even if
he doesn't do it we should give it to
him because hey even if you can't do it
it's worth it for that little bit of
money so sure enough they gave him the
opportunity the next morning he showed
up with his shovel and a bunch of
friends and all the friends had a shovel
they were all just a bunch of peasants
in that world and they go down to where
the boulder is and they start digging a
hole right next to the boulder they dig
a really really big hole and they prop
the boulder up with wood and they dig
under the Boulder and they just dig and
dig and dig and they big such a big hole
that the hole is way bigger than the
Boulder and when they get ready they
just move the props and the boulder
rolled down in the hole and they took
the dirt that dug out and smoothed it
out on top and there's where the boulder
is today under the
highway maybe the thing to do is not
remove my faults just hide them so they
can see the cross
maybe our limits limit us because we
won't we won't hide
me we want to be all about
us but if we made it all about him and
nobody could even find the way to see if
they could just see the Highway of
Holiness and see Jesus and we made the
focus about Jesus who knows but what we
might be able to reach those that right
now we cannot reach maybe we're not as
limited as we think how about let's do
this quit letting it be about
us don't let it be about me the next
time I'm talking to
somebody if they need to step on us step
on
us let it be about
Jesus that's who I want to be don't you
I want to be
that I want to be that from the
beginning to the end but I struggle with
that because I start popping up but if I
could just beat me
down and let them just see him amen just
see him and maybe the place to begin is
at the very beginning when you obey the
gospel let it not be for
show let it be for him if you would
repent of your sins confess the name of
Christ and be baptized today let it be
for
him or don't do it at all and if you
would try to reach somebody let it be
for him or don't do it at all if you
need to come come while we stand and
while we sing
