so what is Love U heard this story it
was today in the word and I thought it
was such a good story uh Geno and his
wife had been married 36 years they were
very happily married and one day Gino
the husband suffered a major stroke and
so he was in the hospital for weeks uh
he lay there slipping in and out of a
coma you probably had someone in that
position that you know that you love and
you know about how a coma can follow on
the hills of a stroke and day and night
his wife though sat right there beside
him and one evening uh she put her head
down on his hand as he lay asleep and
fell asleep on his hand but Gino awoke
during the night while his wife is
asleep on his
hand saw what she was doing and picked
up an envelope and a pencil and scribble
these words
out softly I will leave
you for my heart would break if you
should wake and see me
go so I leave
you long before you miss
me long before your arms can beg me stay
for one more hour one more
day after all the
years I can't stand the tears to fall
so I Leave You
softly what is
love what does it mean to be
unloving interesting thing about this
text about how it defines what's
unloving if we show love simply by
talking
love that's not
love it says though I speak with the
tongues of men and of angels but have
not love I Have Become sounding breast
or a clanging symbol or as 1 John 3:18
NIV says let us not love with words or
speech but with actions and in
truth it has to be more than talk do
that and showing love must be more than
knowing well I know
you that's not
enough and though I have the gift of
Prophecy and understand all mystery and
all knowledge and though I have all
Faith so that I could remove mountains
but have not love I'm nothing so I can
have a lot of knowledge about something
or someone or
concept I'm can to have a lot of
knowledge about my wife or my
children that in and of itself is not
showing
love it's important talking is important
knowing's important giving is important
but showing Love by giving alone is not
love a lot of people think that's the
essence of love because God so loved the
world he gave his only begotten son but
giving alone is not love it says and
though I bestow all my goods to feed the
poor and though I give my body to be
burned but have not love it profits me
nothing so literally you mean to tell me
that someone could be so dedicated to
the Lord that they gave everything they
had to the poor they could be so
dedicated to the Lord that they gave
their body to be burned and that doesn't
necessarily demonstrate
love yeah and that's the strange thing
isn't
it what does it mean therefore to be
loving well the text that was just read
points out these words showing love we
show Love by being patient by being kind
by being generous by being Meek by being
humble by being polite by being selfless
by being peaceful by being forgiving by
being positive by being protective of
the people around us by being one that
can be trusted by being hopeful by being
one who will
persevere and by being one who will
endure so love is not one
thing it's all these
things how many kinds of Love Are
there uh I don't know if you're you like
poetry I like poetry don't expect me to
write it you know roses are red violence
or green you know I don't know but
uh how do I love thee is sonit number 43
by Elizabeth Barrett Browning if you
don't know it to read the whole thing
I'm going to read a little bit of it but
uh she's not my favorite poet my PO my
favorite poet is her husband Robert
Browning uh he's not as well known but
he has my favorite poem which is called
instance tyranus if you ever get a
chance maybe read that one because to me
I can't read that poem without crying
but Elizabeth Barrett Browning wrote
these
words how do I love thee let me count
the ways I love thee to the depth and
breadth and height my soul can reach
when feeling out of sight for the ends
of being in ideal Grace I love thee to
the level of everyday's most quiet need
by Sun and Candlelight I love thee
freely as men strive for right I love
thee purely as they turn from praise I
love thee with the passion put to use in
my old griefs and with my childhood
faiths I love thee with a love I seem to
lose with my lost Saints I I love thee
with the
breath Smiles tears of all my life and
if God
choose I shall love thee better after
death so I think it's healthy to talk
about
love I think it's healthy to know love I
think it's healthy to give love but I
think you've got to see it in its
various levels to begin to enrich your
love I think it's a mistake when a I
don't know five or six year old says
they're in love with the kid they're in
class with and think they fully
understand love right that's why we Call
It Puppy Love they don't really know
love yet they they feel something don't
get me wrong and it's strong and it's
important and it is love but it's
certainly not love like teenager loves
another teenager and it's certainly not
love like you love someone when you fall
in love you're going to get married and
it's certainly not love like after
you've been married a while it's
certainly not love like you've been
married all your life so there's all
kinds of love so I want to look at 10
and I think they might actually benefit
us just to review some of these because
I actually think you might get a glimpse
of something that U might be good for us
to know so number one there's an
unrighteous love
Psalm 52:3 says you love evil more than
good lying rather than speaking
righteousness so I think it's important
to recognize that there's we're we don't
have a corner on the market of love but
because we go to
church that we're the only ones that
feel love that we're only ones have love
I think dogs and cats love but not like
we love right so I I think there is such
a thing as love that people who aren't
trying to to live right have and one of
them is to love evil and you can love
evil you can love getting drunk doing
drugs you can learn love stealing you
can love hurting people you can fall in
love with almost anything so there is an
unrighteous love so just because you
love somebody doesn't mean you love
somebody and then there is an unnatural
love and that's let me move that along
there's an unnatural love Romans chapter
1 and it is love Romans chap 1: 26 and
27 for this reason God gave them up to
vile passions for even their women
exchang the natural use for what is
against nature likewise also the men
leaving the natural use of the woman
burned in their lust for one another men
with men committing what is shameful and
receiving in thems the penalty of their
error which was due so don't say when uh
the LGBT or any of these people say they
love the people they're with don't say
it's not love it is love but it's an
unnatural love and it is a form of love
just like all these others it's a form
of love it isn't a righteous love but it
is a form of love and it's an unnatural
love and you can have an unnatural love
that has nothing to do with that kind of
love you can have a unnatural love for
somebody that's not yours there have
been a many of person that had were
married and still love their old
boyfriend in high
school and could um I won't tell you who
it was but someone I know that was in
love with their boyfriend from high
school as soon as their husband died
went and married him and then told me
later boy that was the biggest mistake I
ever made in my life was marrying him so
uh so yeah that's an unnatural love to
be in love with somebody else while
you're married to someone else there's
an unconditional love this is talked
about in the scriptures as well John
3:16 for God God so loved the world it
didn't say the righteous world the one
that ad met a condition but rather just
the world for God so loved the world
that he gave his only begotten son that
whoever believes in him should not
perish but have everlasting life so so
you two you can love unconditionally you
can love someone who's never done you a
bit of good never done you any good but
not necessarily your enemy just somebody
you know it's never done much for you
but you can still love them you can love
people like that unconditionally you
really can in a forgiving
way the next one is an unmar love which
very similar Romans 5: 6-8 says this for
when we were still without Strength In
Due Time Christ died for the ungodly for
scarcely for a righteous man will one
die yet Perhaps for a good man someone
would even dare to die but God
demonstrates his own love so this is the
love he has
toward us in that while we were still
sinners Christ died for us so similar to
that unconditional love there's an unmar
love and this is a love where instead of
actually loving you know just good
people or just loving people this is
when you're not a good
person loving people who are not good
people this is like I don't know maybe
some of you've done this before have you
ever gone to a prison and uh tried to
encourage people in prison I highly
recommend you do it if you can uh it's
not an easy thing to do uh to get in
it's not easy anymore but uh those
people in there they could use your love
I assure you unmar love God demonstrates
his own love toward us while they we're
still Sinners so maybe we could express
some unmar love and maybe maybe that's
the kind of love you have for someone
after they've hurt your feelings right
unmar
number next is unrequited love it's
actually a sad
love in Luke 13:34 it says oh Jerusalem
Jerusalem the one who kills the prophets
and Stones those who are sent to her how
often I wanted to gather your children
together as a hen gathers their brood
under her
wings but you were not willing he said
well I didn't use the word love there no
Hosea I would have used Hosea but Hosea
is so big it' take for aever just to
study that Hosea 3 verse one where Hosea
after his wife goes and has two Affairs
while they're still together and then
and has children by two different men
and then uh leaves him and goes back to
prostitution until she's old now and
worn out and he goes and buys her back
and takes her home and say is you're
going to be with me
now that's uh an unrequited love but I
think at the end it's not
unrequited but at the beginning it
was some of you have been in unrequited
situations you didn't feel like your
mate loved you like you loved
them yeah I bet that's been a feeling
you've had
before unending love
unending
love Isaiah 54:8 New American Standard
Version I think says it best here in an
outburst of anger I hid my face from you
for a moment I was mad with you
Israel didn't want to even look at you
but with Everlasting
kindness I will have compassion on you
says the Lord your
Redeemer Everlasting loving
kindness Everlasting loving kindness and
a wonderful
statement God loved you with Everlasting
loving kindness you know what that means
long before you existed he loved
you long after you're dead he loves you
Everlasting loving kindness unending
love I hope that's the love you have for
others but it's not as easy as you
think
unending
Everlasting loving kindness
then there's what we might call
unmatched love Matthew 22: 37 and 38
says Jesus said unto him you shall love
the Lord your God with all your heart
now if you love the Lord your God with
all your heart there's no room for
anybody else taking that
place you realize that right no one else
can have
all there's only one
all love the Lord your God with all your
heart
with all your soul with all your mind
you don't love your mate that way you're
not supposed
to you don't love your children that way
you're not supposed to there can only be
one
all you know that
right it can only be one
all this is the first in the great
commandment this is the one that must be
first it's
unmatched if you can match it you
haven't got it
okay unmatched
love difficult to
attain hard to move
there but it must be so nothing equals
it unharmed love Leviticus
19:8 this is where we get the second
commandment this text you shall not take
Vengeance nor bear any grudge against
the children of your people
or the sons of your people basically you
won't hurt any of the people of God you
won't harm them ever never harm church
folks you shall not take Vengeance nor
bear any Grudge now you know what that
means you can't stay mad at your
brethren
hello did you hear that
one if you stay mad with somebody if you
let it hang
on no that's not this love you shall not
take vengeance nor bear any grudge
against the children of your people but
you shall love your neighbor as yourself
I am the Lord now you know where that
commandment comes from this is the Tex
so how do you do that you can't hold a
grudge you can't hold something in here
you know what they did to me no no
unharmed love so we would never
harm our Brethren amen we just never
harm our Brethren you know the worst
thing I could ever imagine is
and I suspect you feel the same way is
if I actually did somebody
harm I would be
horrible then there is an unknown
love you see this unknown love is when
you love somebody that you really don't
know it says in Matthew 5:44 but I say
to you love your enemies now listen to
me on this the reason they're an enemy
is they don't know you and you don't
know
them you hear me
right you understand that right you know
why Hamas and Hezbollah and Israel and
they don't know each
other you don't why there's race
problems in the world people don't know
each
other if you know somebody you can't
know somebody and truly know
them what you're doing is projecting
they're all projecting stuff they don't
know each
other I say to you love your enemies the
people you don't know and the things
they do irritate you okay one a
political setting like we're in that
really fits right I hope you're praying
for the other side amen what if the
other side wins I don't know which side
you're on but what if the other side
when you be praying for them
amen amen amen I see y allall thrilled
about that one so love your enemies
bless those who curse you so you're in
traffic you don't know them never seen
them before never see them again right
hopefully so you never see him again
right and do good to those who hate
you well obviously if they hate you they
don't know you right because you're so
sweet right
you're never hateful
right do good to those who hate you and
pray for those who spitefully use you
and persecute you so that's an unknown
love that's loving people you don't know
and that don't know
you that's what that is it's not as easy
as it sounds is it because we're living
in it right now we're struggling with it
our the whole United States of America
right now I suspect the whole world is
struggling can you imagine Hezbollah how
they feel toward Israelis right now yeah
how's Hamas feel how
right unknown love and then finally now
we want to get to married love this is
married
love I know y'all thought we've been
talking about that no we finally got to
married love it's undertaken
love Matthew 5:46 for if you love those
who love you that's that's what married
love
is you're just loving somebody loves
you if you love those who love you what
reward have
you
children what reward have you do not
even the tax collectors do the same
everybody does that uh John 14:21 talks
about this kind of love it's it's quidd
proquo this is 50/50 uh you do this I'll
do this that's what marriage is you say
oh no no it's 100 100 no it's never 100
100 you've never done 100% for your wife
or your husband you you may want to
claim that but you never have done
100% get off the high horse a minute and
be a real person and recognize you only
maybe did
50% amen wall right so that kind of 5050
is ma John 14:21 where he says he who
has my Commandments and keeps
them has one that loves him because he
who hath my Commandments and keeps him
he it is that loveth
me and shall be loved to my father and I
will manifest myself to him so you do
this for me and I do this for
you you get it say God didn't love that
way when you say stuff like that you're
showing you don't know what you're
talking about because the Bible just
showed you a bunch of different ways
that you can love and God loves all
those ways and more so quit saying
things like well God doesn't do that
kind of thing what do you know about
what God's going to do God's an infinite
being and you're a little Pebble on a a
marble floating around out in
space this is something he does do but
it's a transactional love and in a
transactional love which is married love
you made a covenant why did you make a
marriage
covenant what' you need to do that you
just loved each
other why is there such a thing as a
divorce
document quit thinking this is not
transactional your married love is a
transactional love it is an under you
have undertaken to do this and they have
undertaken to do this you quit doing
this
I'm liable to stop doing this and if you
don't know that's your relationship you
are smoking
something the reality
is we are
humans we are not
God and we have a finite existence here
and in a marriage we entered a covenant
a
contract you don't get to not do your
part
and think I've just got to put up with
it I don't get to not do my part and
expect you to put up with it that is not
the way this works it doesn't really
work that way with God you just noticed
that John 14:21 right there's a certain
level of I'll show you some really great
things if you obey me guess what it
means if you don't obey me I won't show
those things to you right you're not
going to see it so a transaction love a
covenant love quit Brook quote I do this
you do that I do this you do that you do
this I do that that's what it does so
study carefully what a husband's
supposed to do study carefully what a
wife supposed to do don't study so much
what they're supposed to do study what
you're supposed to do try to figure out
what you're supposed to do and give
about 50% because you're not going to
give 100% you just think that especially
if they haven't done their side for a
while cuz that's what starts happening
they haven't done their side for a while
and you start thinking well I'm doing
everything here I'm the one making this
marriage work yeah
right so transactional you have
undertaken love so what I've just done
is I've gone through 10 that's
10 different loves and I haven't even
scratched the
surface I even scratch the
surface you remember Katherine heern
y'all remember y any of y'all old enough
to remember her she died in 2003
American actress 37 Movies 12 Academy
Awards she said this love has nothing to
do with what you are expecting to
get only with what you're expecting to
give which is
everything or do you expected to give
everything whatever it
takes Ernest havan
uh in a bits and pieces back in 1993
wrote this I love this I'm sorry to read
but I think this is so good let me read
it to
you you can see them along the
shuffleboard courts in Florida she
talking bad about Florida no stay with
me you can see them along the
shuffleboard courts in Florida or on the
porches of the old folks homes up north
an old man with Snow White hair a little
heart of hearing reading the newspaper
through a magnifying glass and an old
woman in a shapeless dress her Knuckles
gnarled by arthritis wearing sandals to
ease her AR aching
arches they're holding hands and a
little while they will Tod her off to
take a nap and then she will cook supper
not a very good
supper and they will watch television
each knowing exactly what the other is
thinking until it's time for bed they
may even have a good Soul stirring
argument just to prove that they still
really care and through the night they
will snore
unabashedly eat resting content because
the other is
there they are in
love they have always been in love
although sometimes they would have
denied
it and because they have been in
love they have survived everything that
life could throw at
them even their own
failures
hopefully hopefully like
me you are in
love hopefully you're in love with God
with
Jesus the Holy
Spirit hopefully you're in love with the
church hopefully you're in love with the
Brethren hopefully you're in love with
the word of
God hopefully you're in love with the
plan that God has given us to save us
all and the cross of Our
Lord hopefully you're in love with God's
creation hopefully you're in love with
your
parents with your
brothers with your
sisters hopefully you're in love with
your
children hopefully you're in love with
your
wife or with your
husband I got a good
woman Deborah Clare sheby has been
through a lot to stay with
me more than you
know so when I read this I know it's
personal I don't
care author unknown so don't know who
wrote
it but I've read this many many times
since I was in my 20s I've read it to
many churches it was true when I was in
my 20s it's still true
now there is one person in our church
who knows our preachers
life who've wept and smiled and prayed
with him and that's the preacher's
wife the crowd has seen him in his
strength while bearing God's sharp
sword as underneath God's Banner folds
he faced the devil's horde but deep
within her heart she knows that scarce
an hour before
she helped him pray the glory down
behind the closet
door she's heard him groaning in his
soul when bitter rage The
Strife as hand in hand she knelt with
him for she's the preacher's wife you
can tell your Tales of preachers Brave
who've marched across the world and
changed the course of history by burning
words they hled and I will tell
how back of each some woman lived her
life who wept with
him smiled with
him she was the preacher's
wife now I believe you have a story just
like
that but do you recognize
it in all of our
loves love
don't just talk
it don't just know
it and not just
giving because nothing compares the love
of God and he's not just a God who gave
his son he loved us long before he did
that he's known us all of our life he
said wonderful
things but it's so much more than
that What is love
it's
everything everything
counts what's
love it's giving all you
got don't resist the Lord he loves you
he wants to express his love to you if
you're here tonight and you've never
given your life to him he still loves
you you can turn your back on him he
still loves you you can never come to
him he still loves loves you he loves
every one of us but he really wants you
to believe that Jesus Christ died for
your sins according to the scripture
that he's buried he rose on the third
day he really wants you to give your
life to him and repent of your sins he
really wants you to confess him before
men he really wants you to be baptized
he really wants you to be a church he
really wants you to give your life for
the Lord he really wants that because
that's some of the ways that he knows
then you you love him
back do you love him
back I don't think anybody has a quarter
on the market on love except God who is
love the rest of us aren't
love but we can try better amen we can
try harder let's try to be more loving
if you need to come though come while we
stand and while we sing
