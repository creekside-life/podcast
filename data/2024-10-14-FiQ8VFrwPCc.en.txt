J John preacher told a story that I
think kind of fits our situation in a
kind of a weird way it's about a kitten
this preacher uh got a kitten for his
children right but it was a very small
kitten I mean it was a little bitty
thing and so thinking that they needed
to try to maybe help it grow and develop
they had it out they wanted to play with
it and so somebody got the idea well
well let's put it in the tree
and let the kitten climb around in the
tree that'll strengthen it be able to
see if it gets stronger and so it did in
fact it climbed up a little higher it
got on a a a limb that was a good bit
higher than they could even get close to
reaching and then as it's playing around
on it it's not a very strong kitten it
kind of fell off and it's hanging by
just its front paws and it can't get
back up but it's kind of stuck there and
it can't get up can't get down and they
can't reach it so the preacher pretty
inventive guy and the kids said dad what
are we going to do and so he said well I
got a I got a rope we throw it over the
limb we pull it down I'll put tie it to
the car because it's a big limb we'll
pull it down by the car and I'll pull it
back real easy and we'll maybe be able
to reach it then so that's what they did
threw the Rope over the end of the limb
tied it to the bumper of the car pulled
it begin to move and the limb bent
easing easing and the limb bent bent and
bent and bent as he pulls away pulls
away pulls away and all of a sudden the
Rope
snapped and the kitty
disappeared that's the end of that story
uh all stories don't end
happily and that's an important lesson
for us all to know that every story
doesn't end happily but this story has a
little second part two weeks later the
preacher is visiting
one of his members and they invite him
and he walks into the forer right there
in the forer of the house is that kitty
I mean he recognizes it immediately
that's the kitty and so he he looks down
at that kitty and he he wants to say
that's my kitty but you know he didn't
know what's going on he didn't want to
say that so he said to the lady uh that
was his member of the church and he said
uh nice kitten you have there said oh
yeah yeah nice kitten said uh how how
long have you had that kitten he said oh
about two weeks preacher you will not
believe what happened he says well what
happened he says well my son and I were
out in the backyard and we were working
in the garden and while we're working in
the garden in the backyard my son would
not leave me alone he's been begging me
for a kitten but we're out there working
together he won't stop every minute I
want a kitten I want a kitten and she
finally said Son listen
let's stop we're going to stop and we're
going to pray about it we're going to
ask the Lord Jesus Lord Jesus give you a
kitten then you can have a kitten but if
he doesn't give you a kitten you're not
getting a kitten and he says literally
we bowed down and preacher you will not
believe what happened
next do you believe in
prayer do you believe in prayer y'all
remember Tuesday
night
7:00 we all pray you remember that we
all stopped what we was doing and we had
a prayer that's because we all believe
in
prayer I think what we asked for we
got I think we
got exactly what we asked for but I but
I also think it was kind of like that
kitten it didn't look like we got what
we wanted it looked kind of bad there
for a little bit and yet I believe it's
a good thing so I want to use this
passage
and and I want to talk to you about that
very idea uh I believe there's
unexpected results when we have a United
continuous prayer time I believe that
things will happen that you will not
expect to happen so the first one I want
you to see we're going to break this
text down just a little bit is United
continuous prayer resulted in an
unexpected shift in events look at what
it says I want read part of this I won't
read everything again it says Herod
stuck out his hand to harass some of the
church verse two says he killed James so
remember what I said not all stories
have a happy
ending James was
dead we'll read on it says and he sees
Peter also in verse three and verse four
he says so when he had arrested him he
put him in prison verse 5 says but
constant prayer was offered to God for
him by the church now at this point we
don't know how that happened but later
in the passage it becomes clear this
didn't happen at the building this
happened at various homes kind of like
on Tuesday night various homes
throughout the congregation and they
were various Brethren meeting and
praying together for Peter if you'll
drop down to verse 9 it says so he went
out and followed him and did not know
that what was done by the angel was real
but thought he was seeing a vision we
don't have to go through that whole
story about how the angel released him
but it's amazing what he did what the
angel did and it released him but he
didn't he thought he was just having a
dream he wasn't expecting this in fact
nobody was expecting this because verse
11 says and then Peter had come to
himself he says now I know for certain
that the Lord has sent his Angel and has
delivered me from the hand of Herod and
from all the expectation
of the Jewish people so the Jews sure
didn't expect this the church didn't
expect this Peter didn't expect this
they were all praying for this but they
didn't expect this in fact they would
never have thought this exact thing was
what was going to
happen we had United continuous prayer
and it resulted in an unexpected shift
in the storm folks
how many times you tell were we told it
was coming to
Tampa how many times were we told that
it's going to flood the whole Bay Area
15 ft how many times did you hear it you
were convinced that's what's happening
all the models all the spaghetti models
that's what they told us over and over
and over and on Tuesday night you prayed
against that do you remember that you
prayed against that you didn't know what
God but you were praying for safety of
people you were praying for no harm you
was praying for no one did die you were
praying that that spaghetti model would
not happen that there wouldn't be water
all the way to
I75 every one of us did it but on
Tuesday night there was a shift WFLA
this is from there this was reported
even though it's reported at 650 it
actually didn't come out where we could
see it until after we got through
praying
before they call I will answer while
they're yet speaking I'll hear from
Heaven you remember that statement in
isah okay so literally there was a shift
that's where the shift happened right
there and there was another shift later
but this was the major shift that took
away and after this they started saying
it was going to be maybe below Tampa it
ended up being below Tampa and the flood
into Tampa 15 ft didn't happen and all
the people that would have been drowned
the houses lost there didn't
happen they told me I was watching
another program about they said
250,000 homes would have been hit by
water not
20,000 a quarter of a million homes
would have been at least partially
underwater now whatever you think about
where it went what damage it did that
would have been unbelievable
thank the Lord amen thank the
Lord United continuous prayer resulted
in an unexpected shift in the storm
United continuous pres prayer resulted
in an unexpected service now go to back
to acts 12 you'll I'm going to pick up
and read just here and there verse 12
says so when he had considered this he
came to the house of Mary this is back
to that point in the various homes
there's prayer going on not at some
building I don't even know if they had
buildings at this point the mother of
John whose surname was Mark where many
were gathered together praying they were
there and they were praying like you did
right and as Peter knocked at the door
of the gate a girl named Roa came to
answer and when she recognized Peter's
voice didn't even see him just
recognized his voice she didn't open up
she's a little girl I guess because of
the gladness she did not open the gate
but ran in and announced Peter stood
before the gate he's out there Peter's
out
there verse 15 but they said to her
you're beside
yourself uh
verse uh goes on to say well if if there
is something out there it's his Angel
he's
dead so it's his Spirit come verse 16
now Peter continued
knocking he just kept
knocking and when they opened the door
and saw him they were astonished some of
you sitting here right now are trying to
figure out a way where I shouldn't be
representing prayer being
answered you spend your life astonished
when God answers your
prayer oh that was just a
coincidence shame on
you don't think that way they thought
that
way this doesn't happen God doesn't do
that read on on but motioning them with
his hands to keep silent so they
wouldn't stop
talking everybody's got an
opinion he goes on to say go tell these
things to James and the Brethren and he
departed and went to another place
sounds like another place that was
praying I need to go tell them too they
stop praying
now United continuous prayer resulted in
an unexpected service to our
community what we what's been able to
happen in the last couple of three
days wasn't
planned wasn't our
plan what's been tried to be done in
this community was not ours alifi
rescue has been a major event in the
life of this church you will talk about
this years from
now you will remember this when you're
old some of you already there so I know
you'll remember when you're old staging
areas for Hillsboro Sheriff Department
are not plentiful not every place has a
flat piece of property that's available
or a parking lot on it we were it for
alifi we were it this is by the way the
dream we've had all along right it's
what we've even been preparing for this
kind of thing we're not there yet the
building is not where it needs to be yet
we want to be there where we're really
rocking and rolling with this kind of
thing but right now we were still
available and when they asked when
Hillsboro Sheriff Department asked can
we land your helicopters there our
helicopters there at first I thought
well that's a crazy thing to ask for I
thought why would you need to do that
and then the Aquatic services and the
Florida National Guard they all came by
the way they were here 40 something
vehicles at one time were out here in
the parking lot there's every kind of
aquatic vehicle you could imagine
sitting out there I know some of you
were just home you didn't see it all I
don't have video of All That I don't
even have video I've got video of it but
I just thought n we're not going to look
at all that but there were ve Vehicles
everywhere out here and there was
National Guard uh Air Force I mean you
name it they were here and helicopters
coming and going that happened we had
two out here at one
point two helicopters in the yard nobody
else could do
this this church did
that you didn't know you was praying for
that did you
you see what I mean about unexpected
service they didn't know the brethren in
Jerusalem did not know that one of the
best things that could happen is a good
prayer service and see Peter
saved they would have never believed it
that it could happen because James was
already dead so some of you probably
didn't think we were ever going to get
around to do any service for
anybody and we didn't pick it but God
picked it for us and
alifi was
his family's been helped we I'm not
saying we saved anybody I'm telling
we've helped some people a little bit
just a little bit amen little bit hot
dog is a good thing amen I mean a dry
Blanket's Not a Bad Thing amen by the
way just helping and and I got to say
something about that these First
Responders are good people I talked to a
bunch of them they are good people I'm
telling you straight up made of gold
made of gold I saw some of the men that
were ready to get in the water if they
had to get in the water they were the
scuba guys and I thought man I would
never crawl in that water
underwater back there with how nasty
that water was and they were ready to
go united continuous prayer resulted in
unexpected
service United continuous prayer
resulted in unexpected salvation I'm
tell you something probably most of you
don't know here in just minute so stay
with me just a second this is be new
I was actually told not to tell anybody
but I'm going to tell it
anyway it says in verse 19 but when
Herod had searched for him and not found
him he examined the guards commanded
that they should be put to death so he
had these guys
killed Herod is not a good guy most the
herods weren't this is not a good guy
you see him getting his comeuppence at
the end of this story right I mean they
the voice of a God and immediately the
angel of Lord struck him according to
history it took about 3 Days To a week
for him to die but it was a terrible
death it was a strange death worms
literally ate him it's like he'd eaten
something and it was bad and it's
recorded in history so that's not a joke
he died about 3 4 days
in what I'm want you to see though is
there was a
Salvation due to all these events listen
to me all these events that's in this
story led to verse
24 but the word of God grew and
multiplied people were saved because of
this ain't that interesting who have
thought people being killed people being
put in prison things like that negative
negative
negative people were saved because of
it United continuous prayer resulted in
an unexpected salvation in our
dam what you may not be aware of is Mard
Park was in
Peril not a little bit of
peril but Peril they weren't telling
everybody how bad it was I talked to
them about it after the fact and they
said let's kind of keep it quiet until
we get past this they knew it they all
knew it River Hills was about to get
washed
out if the Medard Park dam broke what
happened is is enough water had come
y'all know how much rain came you saw it
all enough water came down that Medard
Park's dam was filled up it was filling
up too fast they were watching it really
close they knew they could they couldn't
even keep up with it to release it so
they were releasing it you know they
have that release thing they had been
doing that they couldn't keep up they
then had to get big pumps that were
rolling over the top and pumping the
water out now when they did that you
know what that did that raised alifi and
it's the reason that alifi went from a
23 probability that it would reach 23t
to nearly 26 foot because they were
pumping so much water out trying to save
Mard Park Dam y'all been to Mard Park
great fishing place by the way I don't
like fishing but it is a great fishing
place it's a really big lake out there
right if you've been there it's
beautiful you should go cost you a
dollar but you should go and uh but
listen to me I'm telling you straight up
I if all of that had broken if it had
come over the top of that like they were
thinking it was cuz it's mushy now you
know it's wet and now if it starts on
the top it's going to tear it down if
that had come they said you could just
about figure because you got to remember
River Hills can't get out down
here and I don't know if you know it but
Bloomingdale was covered up up here so
they couldn't get out and even if they'
got them out there it had to come out
the top can you imagine trying to
eliminate everybody out of River Hills
what that would have been like if you
think going north on 75 during the
Hurricane's bad imagine that a two-lane
road trying to get everybody out they
couldn't have done it so they didn't
tell everybody they said we got to fix
it because the problem could have been
worse if they had been in the middle of
trying to do that and then it broke
everybody been in their
cars that could have been
worse you didn't know you was praying
for that did you
see they didn't know they were praying
for these PE the word of the Lord to be
spread but the word of the Lord was
spread from this so United continuous
prayer resulted in an unexpected shift
in what was actually going to happen in
an unexpected service that we got to
participate in and an unexpected
salvation people and wait I know you
think the dam was the Salvation no it's
the
people that have been touched a little
bit for
Christ there will be people saved
because of that amen people are going to
be saved because of that and it's a you
know what it's going to do it's going to
light of fire under us to do more amen a
lot of fire under us to do more and do
better so anything is possible you know
how I know anything is possible did
y'all see that rocket come down today do
you see SpaceX catch that
thing I'm sorry that's that's un you
can't do
that that's not possible and they did it
that's humans if humans can catch a 16
story rocket ship Landing with arms they
did it today and nobody got hurt if
human beings can do that what do you
think God can
do what do you
think I'm going to end on this story and
we'll be done
uh John Dr John stot you probably don't
know who that is but he was a uh a
preacher a priest Anglican priest they
call him priest the Anglican Church a
theologian he preached for a long time
1945 to 2007 and what was called in
London All Souls Church All Souls church
I never listened to him either so it's
okay in 2005 Time Magazine said that
stock was among a hundred of the most
influential people in the entire world
so you didn't even know he was one of
the most influential people in the
entire world in
2005 he's dead now he died in
2011 but later in his life uh this is
the story I want to get to and I I know
he's not a member listen to me though I
want you to hear about him because he
puts me to shame
he was talking to a young
preacher
uh and uh
about his prayer
life let me back
up right before he died he had to go
into a nursing
home he was alone no family left
everybody's dead he's right at 93 years
old somewhere in that
neighborhood and he had to go to nursing
home when he went in nursing home he had
to V at his his little apartment that he
lived in when he's preaching
right when they went into his apartment
where he
preached that he had been there since
1945 went over to where his bed
was and next to his bed because there's
a carpet underneath his
bed were two
holes all the way through to the
wood where he had
knelt until he wore holes through the
carpet not threadbear holes total holes
where his knees went to the wood next to
his bed every day so a young preacher
was talking to
him and uh in the process of talking to
him he said the young preacher he kind
of asked pre preacher young preacher
well what's your prayer and bible study
thing and the young preacher cuz he
didn't want to answer he's kind of
embarrassed he said well well what do
you do Dr Scott stot excuse me and Dr
Scot said well uh I'm not very good in
it he said I try to pray and read the
scriptures one hour a
day one afternoon a week
for three
hours one day a
month the whole
day and one week a year every day all
day now did you hear
that I try to pray and read the
scriptures one hour a day knelt next to
his
bed one afternoon at least every week
for three solid hours knelt next to his
bed one day a
month he gives the entire day eight
hours that he doesn't get up he kneels
and prays next to his bed and one week a
year where every single day he gets up
eight hours every day that
week and
praise holy prayer holes
I just think we've got a really good
example of why we ought to be praying
right in front of us right now I think
we just live through it I think you
prayed a lot the last few days and I
think that's great I don't think I've
ever come close at all to what Dr stot
and I don't even agree with him
theologically what are you doing
what are we doing could you wear a hole
anywhere in your pants could you wear a
hole in your
carpet are you praying like that and we
go oh I don't agree with the
anglicans I don't tell you some I agree
with what he
does we ought to be like I ought to be
like that we ought to try for that after
what we've just
seen you just saw a shift in a giant
storm you just saw an opportunity to
serve because of your prayer you just
saw salvation offered to some people
because you prayed I think what to be
praying a little more what do you think
just a little more let's trve to be a
little more diligent in our prayer life
maybe even have a schedule in our prayer
life right pick up our Bible read a
little bit pray a little bit read a
little bit pray a little bit read a bit
pray a little bit United continuous
prayer results in un unexpected
things because it's not your decision or
my decision it's God's decision what's
going to
happen so if you're right with the Lord
that's
wonderful but if you're not listen to me
I bet somebody in here knows
it and I bet they're praying for
you if they're not they ought to be
let's never give up praying
with and for each other
