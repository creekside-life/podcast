Right. I don't have a joke, but I do
have some information to share um
that'll bring me joy that next week, uh
Saturday is Rex's birthday. So, send him
a lot of messages and emails and texts
and and calls. Uh he he he absolutely
hates that. So, do that for me. That'll
be good.
But the reason I'm saying that is
because we actually have men's retreat
next week. And if you haven't signed up,
please sign up. Uh you can see Logan.
Where's Logan?
H he's somewhere here. Put your hand up.
Nope. Don't see him. All right. He's uh
somewhere in the building. But yeah, see
Logan if you want to sign up. Uh and it
starts Friday at 7:00 in the evening. So
hopefully we'll see you there.
So
our father is our lesson today
where this came from and I'm going tell
you about two and a bit months ago. I'm
at home. I am studying in the study. I
am working on lessons. I have my back
towards the door
and my one-year-old son.
All right. I haven't taught him this. No
one's taught him this. But my
one-year-old son, he bust through the
door.
It sounds like that. I kid you not. It
felt like he just kicked the door cuz I
got my back towards the door. So all I
hear is this massive bang.
So I'm like, "All right, this is going
to be good."
And as he steps into the room, I just
feel the energy coming with him, this
confidence, this determination, and I
just know something's about to happen.
and kicks the door and he goes, "Hey,
Keegan."
What?
Calls me Keegan. Now the boy and the
adventurer inside of me thinks this is
awesome. So I slowly turn around.
But the father in me, the father in me,
something overrides that that boyish fun
in me. The father in me says, "Uh, come
again."
 And he looks at me and I
said, "Who am I?"
He says, "Daddy." I said, "All right,
cool. We're good." Right? It was so
funny. Um, but that that got me
thinking. I want to explore this idea of
father. What was inside of me that
overrode
the fun part?
And I wanted to dive into that
relationship, the connection. I don't
want to lose this. You're my boy. Who am
I? Daddy. I love that, right? Um, so
yeah, it's kind of a joke now. But I
want to I want to I want to give you
this uh analogy
and and hopefully you'll understand
where I'm going with this. So on the
left there, that's an outlet. Uh Scott
will recognize it. That's an outlet in
South Africa. We call it a plug, right?
Uh on the right's the American outlet.
Do you notice the difference there?
You notice the uh fun and exciting times
you can have on the left hand side cuz
when you're a kid, your finger can
easily go into that hole.
Right now, let me let me just say South
Africa
was a great country. I mean, the economy
was great. We had some really
intelligent people. Our military was a
force to be reckoned with. I mean, even
the rand was stronger than a dollar at
one point. They were a really good
country. Saying all that, this is one of
the dumbest things I've ever seen.
Right.
So, how do you think my childhood
sounded growing up? Don't put your
finger in the plug. Don't kick him. Back
off. Right. That's that's like my mother
to a te and my dad. No, don't don't
don't.
And as a young kid,
I didn't know any better. Obviously, now
I'm like, "Well, let's put a pen in
there. Let's see what happens." No,
don't do that. But the part of me didn't
understand.
I didn't understand the intricate
workings of the electrical system. I
still don't.
Right. If I look at all that, I'm like,
"Okay, well, yeah, it seems pretty
dangerous." But as a young kid, as an
infant, I had no idea.
All I knew is that my parents were mean.
So I come up with this idea that as an
infant there's this lack of knowledge.
So instead of my parents explaining all
of this,
the answer is simply don't.
Cuz I would bet they don't even
understand that. But don't, right?
And then as I get older, there's an
explanation that starts to happen
between my mother and I, my father and
I. And there's this seems like it's a
respectful thing that they're sitting
down and trying to explain why they're
doing something that way. And then as I
become an adult now, I look back, oh
wow, my parents actually loved me. As an
infant, I thought, you're so mean. Why
don't you let me have fun? But now I
look back and I'm going to do the same
thing to kill him. Don't put your finger
in there.
But now I understand that my parents
love me, my father loves me, my mother
loves me, right? And so I start to see
this this comparison happening in the
Old Testament, this lack of knowledge.
Then we see Jesus come and there's this
beautiful explanation that occurs. And
then we see the New Testament and now
we're all like, "Wow, we're actually
loved." So let's get into that.
So the first point I had was the
father's justice.
Justice is getting what you deserve.
Therefore the Lord waits to be gracious
to you and therefore he exalts himself
to show mercy to you for the Lord is a
God of justice. Blessed are all those
who wait for him. Isaiah 30:18.
So then I had three points under I've
got three points and three points under
the three points. Right? So follow with
me. The first one I had there was the
father's assertion.
Now this is interesting to me because
when I when I research the word father,
it only comes up 15 times in the Old
Testament. That's if you include the
poetic metaphor titles that it's
referring to. 15 times, which blew my
mind, referring to God, right?
And when you talk about father in that
capacity,
it's it's it's
not talking about the father that we
think about right now. This this
connection, it's talking about father
the king. Uh it refers to him as the
head of the household, the owner, that
he has legal rights. It talks about the
moral lawgiver in that context, the
redeemer, the creator, the patriarch. In
other words, this this idea that I made
you, so I own you. I rescued you from
Egypt. I own you. And that's why we see
scriptures like Exodus 4:22. Then you
shall say to Pharaoh, thus says the
Lord, Israel is my firstborn. This idea
that the word father wasn't just a it's
not just a casual way of speaking. It
was pointing to the highest authority in
the universe.
So it's pointing and it blew my mind.
Only 15 times Right.
The other idea is that, okay, Abraham
and Isaac and Jacob are all dead, the
patriarchs. So, we're going to point to
God. That makes sense. That the father
of everything. Um, the best that's the
the best verse to explain that I found
was, "Then you shall say to Pharaoh,
thus says the Lord, Israel is my
firstborn." This idea that access was
not an individual thing. It was through
the tribe.
So he's the owner, the originator, the
the the
king. Right?
The second point that I had there, the
father's holiness. Now, I want you to
feel this point because this is the
feeling we get when we're young. We're
infant
that there's this distance between mom
and dad and me. They don't understand
me. And clearly, you know, I don't
understand them. and you feel this
distance.
And so
because God is a holy father, sin
created this barrier barrier. He
couldn't just walk up uh and and chap
and talk to God. You needed to go
through a priest.
The father was behind a curtain because
he his just sorry his justice couldn't
tolerate the wages of the people's sin.
But also the curtain is not just God in
but to protect the people from the
weight of the justice they couldn't
survive.
So we have this
this distance
and you know how I interpret this
distance back to that plug analogy the
analogy. Why mom? Because I said so.
I'm in charge. Right? So we see God's
justice. He's asserting,
I like the way this lays out as well.
He's asserting his holiness and then his
obligation. And under that holiness,
Leviticus 16:2, "And the Lord said to
Moses, tell Aaron your brother not to
come at any time into the holy place
inside the veil before the mercy seat
that is on the ark so that he may not
die, for I will appear in the cloud over
the mercy seat."
You feel that distance. And the third
point under this one is the father's
obligation.
He's the judge, the authority. Um,
fatherhood meant authority. To call him
father was to acknowledge him as the one
who set the rules of the house.
Disobedience wasn't just a mistake. It
was a legal breach of contract.
The patriarch of all human life, the
rock of the family, firm and immovable.
If a rock falls on you, it crushes you.
But if you stand on the rock, you're
secure. That's the idea. So under this
the justice, you have God asserting who
he is,
his holiness, trying to make you
understand, right? There has to be this
this authority there. And then he's the
judge.
If you break the rules of the house, I
got to do something about it. If you
stick your finger in the plug, I'm gonna
I'm gonna give you a whack on your
behind, right? Are we still allowed to
do that these days? I don't know. I got
lots of those. 
Not only you going to zap yourself and
kill yourself,
but
it's discipline, right? And dad doesn't
want me to die, so he's going to
discipline me so that I don't die. But I
don't understand that yet. So I look to
the Old Testament God. And I know people
think this. They go, "Oh, God in the Old
Testament, just a mean old God.
Okay, let's keep exploring. I want to
come back to that point.
Second point, the father's mercy. This
is that explanation that I'm seeing in
the analogy.
Mercy is not getting what you deserve.
Thank goodness. But God being rich in
mercy because of the great love with
which he loved us even when we were dead
in our trespasses made us alive together
with Christ. By grace you have been
saved to Ephesians 2.
The father's reveal.
This is where it starts to get
interesting.
My that word my when Jesus refers to God
as my father.
Aba. Aba meaning this connection. This
this daddy this papa. It's not this
distant father that we've known in the
Old Testament. It's no no there's
relationship here. There is so much
love. We have a connection.
My my father.
So when Jesus spoke of God with such
shocking famil familiarity
by using aba he claimed that God behind
the temple curtain was papa.
To the Pharisees, this was blasphemy
because it bypassed the priest.
You know, the Pharisees weren't just
mean uh guys, but they saw themselves as
protectors of the Old Testament justice.
So, when Jesus is saying this, it's
dangerous. It's offensive.
And in a way, Jesus is playing with fire
by saying this,
right?
Offensive. You know, the gospel is
offensive.
Why is it offensive? Because I want to
live my life this way. Don't tell me I'm
not allowed to. That's how the how the
world perceives it, right? And so Jesus
is seen as blasphemous.
Now, going back to that idea, the the 15
times it's used in the Old Testament,
right? We've explained that. Well, think
about it this way. 15 times over 39
books over thousands of years. Only 15
times.
You feel that distance, right?
But when Jesus steps in
160 plus times, it's used just in the
gospels.
260 plus times throughout the New
Testament, we see the word father in the
context of this loving dad figure.
Right? So Jesus is bridging this gap.
As you can see, we're slowly growing up,
right? We were in the infant stage. We
didn't really understand God. God says,
"Don't do it." But now we're growing up.
We're like, "Oh, hang on." Okay, there's
an explanation happening now. I'm
starting to kind of understand. That's
where we're at. Um, in John 5:18,
it says, "This is why the Jews were
seeking all the more to kill him."
Because not only was he breaking the
Sabbath, but he was calling God his own
father, making himself equal with God.
He shifted the word
to um to like a primary name now. Almost
like the air we breathe.
When I was a kid growing up in Boni
Church Christ, there was a Scottish man
named Tom King. I hate Scottish. And
he'd get up and he'd pray. Well, when
Uncle Tom would pray, he would say
father at the beginning of the sentence.
He'd say father at the end of the
sentence. And he throw in a few more
fathers in between that.
So, as a seven-year-old kid, and I think
maybe Heath helped me on this one. I
know this is bad, but I started counting
the fathers, right? And I got over 50
once in one prayer. This is highlighting
what I'm saying. Jesus has changed this
idea of this distant father. And we we
we cling to it as a as a name for him,
as a relationship with him.
There was a father's desire
Second point there,
Jesus showed that the father wasn't just
waiting for payment. He was waiting for
a son. In the parable of the prodigal
son, uh the father runs.
Uh let me read that. Luke 15:20. And he
arose and came to his father. But while
he was still a long way off, his father
saw him and felt compassion and ran and
embraced him and kissed him. This was
scandalous in the Old Testament. This
was an embarrassment for the patriarch
to run.
The point that Jesus is showing here
that God is God is running to you and
doesn't care about embarrassment.
God the father, the creator of the
universe, doesn't care what other people
think about him or how it makes him
look. I want my son. I'm running to him.
This starts to change my understanding
of the Old Testament mean God that we we
so often throw that out. This starts to
make something different happen.
Um
the other the other side of it, a
rebellious son could be brought before
the elders in Deuteronomy chapter 21 and
stoned.
Now I've thought about this. Uh most of
our elders, they got shoulder problems,
so we're okay, right?
But
the halacher is the rebellious son. I
mean by law the father could have put
him out.
Instead he runs towards embarrassingly
towards a rebellious son.
This highlights the desire he has for
us.
So once again these three points God the
father's revealing his desire and his
availability. Um
Jesus taught his followers to pray our
father. Effectively handing them the
keys to the house.
He bridged the gap by making the unique
relationship with God our relationship
with God. This is inclusive. I read that
scripture. Matthew 6:9. Pray then like
this. Our father in heaven hallowed be
your name. This inclusiveness of the
person sitting next to you. No matter
where you from, what walk of life, what
you know what
all our differences, we're all included.
Our father, you're my family. You're my
brothers and sisters.
Our father
deep connection.
Actually proving that the curtain has
been removed.
Let me highlight that. The distance
that we saw in the Old Testament, we
felt God's holiness. We needed to
understand and feel God's holiness. We
needed that distance. We didn't like it.
But now we start to understand, oh, he
is holy. And what he's slowly starting
to do is beautiful and rescuing me. And
so that distance is closing in. Ow,
father.
And finally, the last point,
well, big one. Um, the father's grace is
getting what you don't deserve. And we
start to see that love, love come in
that infant stage.
We don't understand the lack of
knowledge. We've seen the explanation of
Jesus. Okay, we're starting to get it.
And now we're going to see the love in
the New Testament. start to understand
that our parents that God our father our
our abba
he loves us. So the father's adoption
it's a legal change. The New Testament
father doesn't just feel love.
He legally changes our status.
We are moved from the wages of sin
which is death to the inheritance of the
son which is life.
allowing us to cry out, "Aba," Galatians
4:7, "So you are no longer a slave, but
a son, and if a son, then an heir
through God."
In the Roman world, an adopted son was
legally chosen and could never be
disowned. Let me say that again. In the
Roman world, and I remember Paul's
writing this, um, an adopted son was
legally chosen and could never be
disowned. A biological son could. So
Paul adds his layer of security. The
father didn't just find us. He chose us.
He paid our debts and he signed it in
blood.
The father's connection.
This is that distance again being
deleted between my father, our father.
The old testament father was in the
temple. The new testament lives in the
child. this connection that we now have.
This distance is deleted because the
Holy Spirit cries out u from within us.
He is no longer a distant uh sorry he's
no longer distant rather indwelling and
only a whisper away.
Grace is a legal standing. H let me say
again. grace is a legal standing not God
ignoring our sin but reclassifying us
not as pardoned criminals
but as heirs legally our father pays the
debt.
So in Romans 8:15 it says uh for you did
not receive the spirit of slavery to
fall back into fear but you have
received the spirit of adoption as sons
by whom we cry aba father.
I'll be honest when I was baptized at 14
I did it out of fear.
But now I stand here today with a better
understanding of my father and the love
that we have now. The fear is not the
same as what it is now. I have a
healthier understanding. I have a better
relationship with my father as I grow.
And finally, the father's ultimate love,
the sacrifice. The greatest of these is
love is proven here. The father doesn't
demand we die for our sin. He sends the
son who is one with him to die for us.
1 John 3:1. See what kind of love the
father has given to us that we should be
called children of God. And so we are.
The reason why the world does not know
us is that we did not know him.
Ultimate
love, the sacrifice. I get it now.
So, we see God's justice, the father's
justice. He sets the holy standard. We
needed that holy standard. We needed the
don't
to survive.
We need his mercy. And so, he absorbs
the holy sentence. And I definitely need
his grace.
He gives the holy inheritance. And so in
Hebrews 13:8, when it says God is the
same yesterday, today, and tomorrow, and
forever,
how can we turn around and say, "Well,
God's this mean old God in the Old
Testament." That's not the case. I see a
loving, caring,
sacrificial God, a father who
desperately wants us. But now I look
back and I understand
I needed that. I needed to because I was
in my infant stage. I didn't know. And
let me back it up. Go and do go and do a
study on God's wisdom, the manifold
wisdom of God, and realize how small and
insignificant you are standing next to
his wisdom.
You want to tell me you understand all
that? I got no idea.
more I read the more I'm like I have no
clue.
So my point is
that distance that we thought was there
was God actually setting the standard
and trying to teach us this is what
needs to happen because this is who I
am. I'm not just your father, your abba,
I'm your king. I am the judge. I am the
authority. I'm the head of the
household. I am everything and I'm your
your dad and I'm your your papa. that
connects you.
So, this all culminates.
Let me put this I'll put it back later.
This all culminates in the end. Uh 2
Corinthians 5:21. For our sake, he made
him to be sin who knew no sin so that in
him we might become the righteousness of
God.
I think this is the pinnacle of the
story.
I'm not necessarily saying the
resurrection, but hear me out. I think
the pinnacle of the story is the day of
judgment.
The celestial day of judgment when we
stand before God and he's up there on
his throne with his gabble or whatever
it might be,
the king.
And he looks down and he says, "Kegan,
my son,
the wages of sin are death,
and it's time to take your payment." And
I'm crying out, "Dad, no. Please,
please, I can't take it. I I can't take
that that penalty. I can't take the
death. I literally cannot take it.
Please." He says, "I'm sorry, my son.
I'm the judge.
I have to be just because if I'm not
just, we have a world of chaos. Heaven
would be chaotic. I have to be just. I
have to be consistent. That's who I am.
That's the holiness of me. I'm sorry, my
son. You're guilty. Father, please. No,
Dad. No.
And he steps off the bench.
takes off his robe and walks down and
stands next to me and says, "You're my
son. I'll take it.
I'll take it.
I'll die for you. And I'll die for you.
And I'll die for you. And I'll die for
you. And I'll die for you. And I'll die
for you.
