I hope everyone's doing fine this
evening. So I see Murphy has already
stepped in
and
causes angst within everything that goes
on and that's all part of life and
that's an okay thing. So that's great.
First of all, I'd like to to say thanks
to the elders for this opportunity and
also to Rex for letting me have the
opportunity to speak. Whether it be one
of many or the first and last, we'll
see. Rex came up to me the other day and
he said, "You know, I never knew your
dad actually spoke at Bill Scholes." And
yeah, it was uh probably few decades
ago, I'd probably say. But
yeah, first of all, I'm Ben Blackman.
Uh, been here for about 12 years now. My
wife and most of you know us by the
number of children that we have over
there. Um, my wife Jessica. And if uh
the name starts with a C, that's
probably one of my one of my children.
So, there's 12 of them around. Some of
them are kind of moved off to other
pastures like Mississippi and to uh
Kentucky and now one's over in uh uh New
Zealand on a mission trip. And then I've
got another one that's uh just moved
over to Edgewater to go to lineman
school. So we're moving all
about. I am a one of the deacons that we
have here and two of my main
responsibilities is I'm the Florida
Bible Camp. Rex mentioned that this
morning. and I'm the session one
director and I'm responsible for the
overall planning, conduct, supervision,
safety and Christian environment of the
camp for both the campers and for the
staff. Another function that I have here
is teen adult education development in
which I assist in the development of
curriculum and also for the development
of teachers for that. So if you have any
questions we can talk about that later.
What I want to talk about tonight is a
thriving spiritual marriage and
ultimately it's a call
for into deeper
faithfulness. Uh the verses that were
read and I I appreciate Harrison for for
you know kind of uh shifting on me right
there for a little bit. So is Ephesians
5:22 to 33. These are verses that you've
probably heard quite often. All right.
And of course there's a lot of dialogue
on what exactly it means and oo this
word of obedience. We're not really
going to get in tonight. That's going to
be time for another lesson. There's
plenty of le lessons on this. But we're
going to we're going to get into this.
But first what I want to do is I just
want to kind of start with do you
remember for those of us that are
married, do you remember why you got
married? Have you really thought about
it?
I see some smiles out there, some
wonderments. It's kind of like why did
we get married? So, all right. So, may
maybe I can jog your your brain a little
bit here, you know. Um, first of all,
maybe there was that love and that trust
in this individual that you met, you
know, this this aspect of, oh, it was
just something wonderful. This there was
excitement there. There's, you know, the
the the endorphins were just going and
it was just it was just wow. you were
just excited to see this person. It
brought something into your life. It was
just something exciting and it's someone
that you felt you could trust, you can
confide in. It was just a really great
time. Or or maybe it was the essence of
shared goals, you know, that hey, this
is someone that I could actually see
myself moving through life with. Um
maybe it's the aspect of this idea that
we can mutually support. You know, the
idea I know some people come up with
some great ideas like, well, you know,
uh, well, well, two can live, you know,
cheaper than one. Falsehood. But anyway,
anyway, so we'll we'll continue on with
that. Maybe it's just more time together
because you enjoyed spending so much
time together. You wanted to have that
ultimate ability to be able to just wake
up and they're
there. And then during the day, they're
there. And then at night, they're there.
and it sounds great until the end of the
honeymoon. Then you find out that
someone's got to work to pay bills and
they're not always there. And then you
find these other little things that come
into mind. I mean, marriage is this
beautiful journey built on these
foundational pillars of love, trust,
mutual respect. You know, each of these
essential and they're they're they're
necessary for a strong and lasting
relationship. But it's important for us
to remember the reasons
that we chose to marry our partner. The
companionship, those shared goals that
we just talked about to work toward
together common objectives and the
promise to support each other through
thick and
thin. Supporting each other through life
struggles is key to a successful
marriage. And reflecting on these
foundational reasons can strengthen your
bond and rekindle the love and
commitment in your relationship.
But
ultimately we marry just to have more
time
together. Keep that thought in the back
of your mind as we go through this
lesson. But here's the truth of that
aspect. Kind of comes down to that idea
that newly wed
couple they go through and it's the
honeymoon. The honeymoon's
over. Alarm goes
off and a hand reaches out and hitches
the
snooze. Goes off again. Hand reaches out
and hitches the snooze.
All of a sudden, the guy goes, "Hey
babe, how does eggs and maybe some uh
bacon and maybe some pancakes or waffles
sound?" Because he's trying to give her
a little bit of nudge. And all of a
sudden, she goes, "That sounds great.
Would you go make it?" And he's like,
"What?"
And all of a sudden there's this idea
because she grew up in a family where
her dad always made breakfast but he
grew up in a family where the mom always
made breakfast and then we start having
some discontent that goes on. My point
within this what I'm saying is marriage
is hard and that's just a simple idea
there. You know marriage I mean it's a
complex and challenging relationship
that requires constant effort and
commitment from both partners. involves
navigating differences, resolving
conflicts, maintaining open
communication. Couples must navigate
differences and find common ground and
maintain a healthy
relationship. And that's all trying to
navigate these difficult uh differences
that we have here. It also talks about
resolving
conflict. That's crucial in marriage
that requires patience, understanding,
and effective communication.
There's a lot of challenges that face
each other just inside the marriage but
also outside of the marriage throughout
your daily lives in the
world. Open communication is
vital to the successful marriage.
Couples need to share their thoughts and
feelings honestly with each other.
something that's
difficult especially in this day and age
which we only seem to try to communicate
through text and in short little
aspects and we don't really have really
good honest dialogue
anymore demands collaborative effort to
handle daily life career pressures and
personal growth ensuring a strong bond I
mean this is collaborative understanding
and compromise are touted you know by
the world as key elements for a success
successful marriage, but in the
end those tend to fall
short. Having a higher common bonding
principle such as
God that both husband and wife
completely subscribe and are devoted to
is marked as one of the most
successful aspects of a marriage. And
the reason why it's not about me, it's
not about my wife. It's about ascribing
myself to God. And that's where the
unity is. The unity is not in me. The
unity is not in Jessica. The unity is in
God. If you want to understand that
better, go home and read John
17. Ephesians 22 through33. We've
already kind of read through
that and that kind of sums it up
also. Biblical marriage and that's what
I want to talk to you about because
there's there's views of marriage all
over
but it comes from that origin
aspect. Marriage is pretty much as old
as Adam and Eve when you really get
right down to it. Can't really define
it. first couple, first marriage. Kind
of the defining words of the the two
becoming one. The idea of of leaving
father and mother and cleaving that
comes from right
there. But there's something I want to
pull back and think
about. Whose image were they created
in? Was it
God's? This is about the time Rex would
say, "Amen.
Walls." All right.
My point being is this. God is a
relational
being. Just think of the idea of God the
father, God the son, God the holy
spirit. Relation. The idea wants a
relation. He wanted a relationship with
man. But he also knew with us being made
in his image that we also needed to have
a relationship. That's the reason why we
have the church. That's the reason why
we have families. That's the reason why
the church is considered a family.
That's the reason why we be become
adopted. I mean, we can go on and I
could start just throwing out verse
after verse after verse
here, but I want to get to a certain
point. Adam and Eve's union symbolized
the origin of marriage. Marriage
reflecting divine creation and the
foundation principles of partnership.
The biblical view of
marriage is a sacred covenant between a
man and a woman ordained by
God. When two come down that aisle and
they're married, it's something that's
going joined together by
God. So, it's there's already three
within this relationship. It's not just
two people coming together. It's God
putting it together.
It emphasizes a deep union of love,
fidelity, and mutual respect. In each of
these being essential to the foundation
of a strong and enduring
relationship, marriage is seen as a
reflection of Christ's relationship with
the church,
symbolizing unity,
commitment, the nurturing and spiritual
growth within the family, fostering
strong faith-based
relationship. It's this reflection that
we have, this aspect of
love, but it's also filled with roles
and challenges. Roles for the husband,
roles for the
wife. Biblical narratives offer insights
into these roles, challenges, and
spiritual significance associated with
marital relationships, providing
God-given guidance for couples.
I tell my children in
life that there's two most important
decisions that they have in
life. It revolves this something I teach
also at Bible camp. I teach it over in
our teen
class. And the first one is whom you
will
serve. Second is whom you will marry.
And here's the funny aspect about
that is the one that you serve ends up
being one that you marry. And the one
that you
marry, if you follow the biblical
principle, is one that you're going to
serve. You can't get away from it. And
this is the beauty of God's
word. I love how God uses analogies. I
love how he uses the parables. I I it it
is something that is so wonderful
getting into his
word. We have this biblical metaphor of
marriage. And we can see this here. And
thank you again, Harrison, for reading
this for me and going for the the full
amount. But I want you to concentrate on
something here. This is one where a lot
of people they want to either sometimes
play this down because they don't like
the obedience of the wife obedient to
the husband. But here's the problem with
that. When we get to this aspect of this
mystery is great, but I'm speaking in
reference to Christ the church. If you
dumb it down in one way, then you're
dumbing down what we need to have in
obedience to
Christ. If you weaken one side of this,
you weaken the other side of it. And he
can't do that. Scripture is pretty
plain. But what it means and what I try
to explain to our youth when we're we're
teaching them is you've got to make a
good
decision. You've got to find someone
that's just not all wrapped up in you,
but you got to find someone that's
wrapped up in Jesus Christ
first. I want my wife to love Jesus
Christ more than
me. And then I know that if she isn't
aligned with him, then we've got it made
as long as I'm in aligned with him
because that's where the unity will come
in. It's great talking about marriage,
but I want you to understand something
here. I want to concentrate on this
aspect that's right here in verse 32
where it says, "But I'm speaking
reference to Christ in the
church." The Bible uses the metaphor of
marriage to describe the relationship
between God and his
people. We see it here in Ephesians 5
and we see what Paul has written in
verses 25-
27. This passage show the depth of
Christ's love for the
church. That level in which he gave his
life for the
church. A sacrificial purifying love. It
says a high standard for how the church
should respond with
unwavering
devotion and
fidelity. The church is often referred
to as the bride of Christ. This
metaphor signifies the intimate loving
relationship between between Jesus
Christ and his follower followers. The
concept emphasizes the purity, devotion
and commitment that the church must
uphold akin to the bond of marriage is a
call for believers to remain faithful
and prepare themselves for the ultimate
union with Christ upon his return.
in it is
considered in the Old Testament. He
refers to Israel as his
betrothed. This isn't just a new
concept. This is the relationship that
God has had with his people throughout
time. We see what it has here within
Ephesians. It has these themes of love
wrapped up in it, of purity,
devotion, of faithfulness, and
preparation.
In our western culture, we have the
concept of a web wedding ceremony. Can
you picture that in your mind? What goes
on in a wedding
ceremony? And what leads up to that
wedding ceremony? Of course, there's
this idea that you're learning of this
person that you're going to eventually
become married
to. And then as you come through that
ceremony and and now you're actually
there and what does the bride do? She's
kind of hidden away somewhere
there. The soon to be husband, the
bridegroom, he's up here principively
waiting. And then she comes down the
aisle. Vows are
exchanged. Tokens are exchanged.
wonderful thing. But I want to show you
a
parallel doesn't fit exactly. Not that
I'm that good,
but just go with the flow a little bit
here. you hear the word Romans 10:17,
but in
wedding before that wedding, you're
learning about each other the same way
as when you're hearing that word, you're
learning about Jesus
Christ. And then you believe Hebrews
11:16
11:6, this person you decide and you
learn more about him, you're thinking,
"This just might be the
one." Yes, I I I think this is the one
that I want to be with.
toward baptism. You repent. You turn
away from that everything that you used
to do. And now you're going to move
toward
Christ. In the wedding situation, you're
now going to turn from others and you're
now going to devote yourself to that one
individual. You walk the
aisle. Now, doesn't always happen, but
I'm trying to give you the idea of
what's usually happening within the
church setting. You come down that
aisle. You can confess before God and
others. You deliver that vow of your
belief as we had two young gentlemen do
today. Romans 10:10. Just as in the
wedding, you're confessing before
others. And what do you always have to
have? Even legally, you have to have a
witness
there. And what you're saying, yep, this
is the one. I am now going to be
his. You become a new creature in
baptism. You take off that old self and
you become a new
creature. In the wedding
ceremony, you're leading to that aspect
of the two becoming
one. You take on a new name. You're now
Christ's
Christian. You take on the husband's
name. Now, I know there's cultural
aspects, but want to say this, but I'm
saying in general speaking here, and
then you live faithfully.
A lot of parallels
here. But with all things whenever
you're looking at this and you know
marriage is significant milestone in
life filled with excitement and joy. It
marks the beginning of a shared journey
between two individuals just as becoming
a Christian marks a shared journey in
which you're now becoming a member of
the bride of Christ. as two gentlemen
did
today. You're creating memories,
experiencing, you're growing. You're
still going to be learning about each
other. It doesn't mean you have perfect
knowledge at that point in time, but
you're still growing, striving, doing
more. As King mentioned in class today,
it's that that head and that heart that
we have going on in the health and the
way that you're doing is you're
nourishing it through the word of God.
They're getting that unity because that
unity is in
Christ. That wedding olis is a
significant part of the
ceremony. But there's a downside to the
metaphor of being the bride of Christ
and
also of
marriage. And this is the hard part of
it is the spiritual adultery image that
we have because throughout history there
have been times when the church has
strayed committing what can only be
described as spiritual adultery against
her
bridegroom. And this is where we get to
that call to a deeper
faithfulness because that's what this
sermon is really about. Everything up to
this point time has been
introduction. This is where we get to
the the nitty-gritty on this one
here because this sermon is a call for
repentance, a reminder of the grace that
Jesus extends to his bride even in her
unfaithfulness. We got to remember when
we come together here, we are the bride.
Old Testament imagery that we have for
this concept of spiritual
adultery. It's not new. It's biblically
depicted in the Old Testament.
Particularly whenever we look at Hosea
the second
chapter. Hosea called, let's see, Hosea
was called by God to marry Goomemer, a
woman characterized by unfaithfulness.
It's a living illustration of Israel's
betrayal of
God. In Hosea
21:19 declares, "I will betroth you to
me forever. I will betroth you in
righteousness and justice and love and
compassion. I will betro you in
faithfulness and I will acknow and you
will acknowledge the Lord despite
Israel's repeated idolatry and rejection
of God. The Lord's covenantal
faithfulness remains
steadfast just as
Jesus's steadfastness remains."
Similarly, in Ezekiel
16, it portrays Jerusalem as an
adulterous wife, lavished with
blessings, but turning to idols and
foreign powers instead of remaining
faithful to
God. And the 32nd verse laments, "You
adulterous wife, you prefer strangers to
your own
husband." These passages serve as stark
reminders and warnings about the dangers
of idolatry and unfaithfulness.
And it's a call to
repentance. And today, spiritual
adultery in the church. I know adultery
is a strong word. It's something that we
don't like. Of course, much of the world
turns a blind eye to it. It's like every
day. You can see it in soap opers. You
can see it in movies and such.
But through the imagery of spiritual
adultery appears heavily in the Old
Testament. It resonates deeply with the
New Testament church as well. James 4:4
we
read, "You adulterous people, don't you
know that friendship with the world
means enmity against God? Therefore,
anyone who chooses to be a friend of the
world becomes an enemy of
God." Here, James confronts the church
with a reality of spiritual infidelity.
When believers prioritize worldly
desires and allegiances above their
covenant with
Christ, Revelations 2:4, Jesus rebukes
the church in Ephesus for forsaking
their first love. A pointant reminder
that even fervent followers can drift
away from their intimate relationship
they are called to maintain with their
savior. Spiritual adultery refers to the
act of turning away from one's faith and
engaging in practices that are contrary
to spiritual beliefs. prioritize
materialism over spirituality, engaging
in unethical behavior, and adopting
secular ideologies that conflict
religious
teachings. This deviation can lead to a
sense of spiritual emptiness and a loss
of connection with one's faithful faith
community. You might ask, well, how does
these manifest
today? You know, the idea like we don't
worship false idols. We don't have, you
know, bronze statutes to
us, you
know, but idolatry can be found in
anything that you're spending more time
and you spend more focus on than
on your
husband. And by husband, I'm referring
to Jesus Christ.
Whether it is worship of material
possessions, careers, social status,
idolatry replaces our devotion to Christ
with false
gods. Some of them you have right with
you now. Their names are Android,
iPhone, and some of it is the God that
we actually stamp in God we
trust. And that's who we were really
seeking after. Some of it's the social
status and we're looking at how many
hits that we can get and what makes me
feel good. It's whenever it's something
that's devoted to self over seeking
after our Lord and Savior. It's
compromised with the world. When the
church adopts worldly values at the
expense of biblical truth, she
compromises her fidelity to the
bridegroom. It's the neglect of word and
prayer. a relationship that thrives on
communication. When the church neglects
scripture and prayer, she distanced
herself from
Christ. Division and disunityity. The
church is called to unity in Christ. Yet
infighting and
factionalism betray one's the oneness we
are meant to have with him. It's about
limited communication, lack of time in
worship and study of God's word.
Lack of time in
prayer. At the risk of being ostracized,
let me speak
bluntly. Look to your left and look to
your
right. How do our numbers look tonight
compared to the way they were this
morning? Now, yeah, there are those that
might have good
reason, but there are some that are
probably thinking, "I checked the
block." Those of you that are married,
look at your husband. Look at your wife.
If it was your
anniversary and they felt they just
checked the block, would you be
happy? Remember, we were made in the
image of God.
When we come here to worship, do we
understand that one little meager hour
of worship and we're coming here and we
take a quick look on our cell phone to
check that email or that text that came
in and our focus is no longer on
Christ. That's like being at a
restaurant with your
beloved and you're checking your your
iPhone.
Do you see what I'm
saying? When we do things and we're
like, "Well, I I'm I'm I'm over here and
I'm I'm preparing this." This is a time
that our elders have said for us to come
together, for us to worship our
husband. And I think we miss that
sometimes when we're singing. Are we
really taking those words to heart and
we're singing and making that melody
that we should be when we're praying?
Are we actually praying and
communicating? Are we waiting for that
guy to hurry up and say
amen? Are we concentrating on the exact
flavoring we're going to have on our
brisket for
lunch? Where is our focus at? Are we
listening to the word that's being
spoken? And I'm not referring to me up
here right now, but anyone that is up
here in giving God's word and we're
ingesting that
morsel when we're having the Lord's
supper, do we understand that we're
fellowshipping with Christ our
Lord? When we're giving, do we
understand that that is worship?
not about me. I appreciate what brother
Sean said this morning. It's not about
paying the
bills. It's about showing love to our
husband. Our focus needs to be
refocused on what it needs to be.
Because when we're
here, I'm not in charge. I'm a
mouthpiece. I'm going by some things
I've studied. I'm not speaking here
because I've attained and I've reached
it. This is me studying going, I need to
do
better. We all probably need to do
better. Because you know who the
audience is right
now? It's not you.
You all are actually the participants.
You're the actors right now and the
audience is
above. Let me hit a little closer to
home. That idea of that
nourishment that we need to
grow and to grow our
relationship, our marital relationship
that we have, this union that we have
with Christ is in the Bible study that
we have out
there. And when we are standing out
there and the time of fellowship is over
and Bible class starts, do you know
where we should be as the bride of
Christ? We should be in the Bible
study, not out flapping our l flapping
our
lips. I know that that sounds rough.
You're like, "But I'm fellowshipping."
No, you're not. Unless you can tell me
that you're in a deep talk about the
Lord's and about the word of God and not
talking about what happened in your
week, that's a time that's been set
aside for you to get in there and study
God's
word. It's a time for me to get in there
and study God's
word. And yes, I hope there are people
that are from Sunday morning crowd
listening to this. Lord willing, they
will and they can come and bash me about
it all they want cuz this wonderful
building that we built here, we've got
nice glass
windows and I'm watching as our teams
are looking out the windows as people
are getting out and going to them and
getting in their cars and driving
away. We have a newcomers
class for new converts right out there.
Thanks again to the
Wests. They have those windows right
there. They can see all these people
that are showing with their feet how
they're
voting. Am I stinging a little
bit? I I'm not here to be I'm I'm here
to say what I'm
seeing. I'm being honest with you.
How can we set the example and tell
people we want you to come here and
worship with us while we got people
running out the
doors? I think we all need to refocus.
We've come too
comfortable. We become too
complacent. The same thing that happens
in our earthly
marriages. I take Jessica for
granted and I'm ashamed of
that. I just expect things to
be. I have found firefights in Iraq and
Afghanistan easier to manage than it has
been to be
married. And I've had less
fear in those countries than I have than
in facing my wife. I'll be straight
up because I'll be honest with you, I
went and I found out the world's most
stubborn woman and I made a comment to
her. If I could ever get her stubborn
for me, we would have something that
would last. For some odd reason, she's
still sticking around. And it ain't
because I'm
rich. What I'm saying to my
fellow bride mates, maybe that's
it, is if we're going to start doing and
we're going to work with the
impact. Here's a key in for you,
brother. We got to work internally
first to have someone say that, "Yeah,
those people are sticking together.
They're working it." Because here's the
deal. If you think church and being the
bride of Christ is about just coming in
on Sunday morning, doing Bible
study, drinking some
coffee, Wednesday
night, we're missing
it. When I read about how that first
century church and how they were meeting
in their houses
daily, we don't know each other. Let's
be honest. Let's just be honest.
It's it's it's understandable why we
want to talk so much during that time
and we don't get in a class because you
know something we don't talk at any
other
time. Shame on us. Shame on
me. I've heard Rex say many times, "This
is the core group." Well, why don't we
as the core
group up it up a notch?
Why don't we show what the bride of
Christ should really do and show how we
should really respect our husband and
how we should really worship him in the
corporate worship in our
study and in our daily life worship
because sometimes and I tell you what
you don't have to go much further than
Facebook and you could see some things
that we wear that we wouldn't be caught
dead in church
with. I'm just being honest.
Hate me later. They'll hate me now. It
It doesn't
matter. Believe it or not, this is
coming from the heart. And it's not
because I'm perfect. If you're looking
for perfect, you're This is the wrong
example. Perfect's behind me and above
me. And I'm hoping that I'm doing him
justice.
I'm sorry that this is not a hey
everything's good to go kumbaya kind of
lesson but this is coming from my heart
cuz I want to do
better. I really
do. The cool thing about this
though is God loves us and he wants
us for a
husband. I am guilty of so
much and God still loves me.
God sent his son to this
earth for
me. That within itself is amazing. But
that he did it for everyone else too is
even more so. The fact that he came and
died is one aspect.
The fact that he bore our sins and that
God had to turn away from him because he
couldn't be in God's
presence. That is an amazing level of
thought. I can't
reach. But what we can
do is we can rededicate ourselves to
teachings.
Renewing the covenant involves
rededicating oneself to the teachings
and values of Christ because we have
God's redeeming love. Despite the church
unfaithfulness, our bridegroom remains
faithful. Romans 5:8 writes
that Paul just says it pretty simply,
but God demonstrates his own love for us
in this. While we were still sinners, he
died for us. Jesus willingly laid down
his life as an act of love and
redemption, offering forgiveness to us,
the weward
bride. I mean, the story of Hosea and
Goomer illustrate God's relentless
pursuit of his unfaithful people. What
we studied for a while on Wednesday
night in the teen about judges, about
how man just keeps on doing what is
right in their own sight. We got to stop
looking with our sight. We got to start
looking with God's sight in doing what
is right by the way that he wrote it.
That's what we need to do. That's
rededicating to these
teachings. It's not only restorative,
but it's
transformative that we can be that that
church that's without blemish and pure.
It's about developing this deeper
relationship with with Christ.
It's about strengthening our our faith
and connecting with him. It's about
active participation in church and
worship. And when I say
active, you may not always feel it, but
if you're pushing forward and you're
letting that go out, it will bless you.
If you're coming in here looking for
something, that's probably the time that
it's not. But what happens is whenever
you're giving out and you're giving it
to
God, what you're going to find out is
you're blessing that person to the left
and to the right of you and you're
edifying them in ways that you don't
know. When you're
there as a
presence, you're showing
God. But not only are you showing God,
you're showing others.
It's this obedience to the Christ that
we're talking about
here. Following his teachings, adhering
to them, incorporating them in your
daily life so that the person that the
people at work see it's the same as you
are here at church. It's not that you're
different at church and then you're
something different at work.
If it's the only time that people hear
about God when you're at work is
whenever you happen to hit your thumb
with a hammer, that's probably not the
way that we're
going. Obedience to Christ is
demonstrated through acts of love,
service, and devotion. Remember this
right here. This is
not the evangelism aspect of it. This is
the buildup aspect of it. This is the
battery charge aspect of it. This is
devotion to what has been done for
us. The battle is beyond these walls. If
the battle is inside
here, we got a problem with the
eldership. We got a problem with
ourselves. Because here's where that we
get strengthened.
When we see this building, the way that
I look at it, this is a tool shed. We're
in here sharpening ourselves. We're
getting ready to go out there to the
field and do the
works, spiritual
growth. We got to be in the
word. Committing to renew the church's
covenant with Christ is a vital step for
spiritual growth and community unity.
This involves
rededicating oneself to the teachings
and values of Christ, fostering a deeper
relationship with him and actively
participating in church activities. By
doing so, members strengthen their
faith, support one another, ensure the
church remains vibrant and essential
part of their lives. As we reflect on
the covenant with Christ, the call to
repentance becomes clear.
2 Coronicles 7:14 reminds us, "If my
people who are called by my name will
humble themselves and pray and seek my
face and turn from their wicked ways,
then I will hear from heaven and I will
forgive their sin and will heal their
land." Repentance involves turning away
from sin and returning to our first
love, Jesus
Christ. It requires humility,
confession, and commitment to follow him
wholeheartedly. Our church must
recommmit to her covenant
relationship, embracing her identity as
the radiant bride of
Christ. It's too easy that the church's
ability to turn against Jesus are become
complacent. It's a sobering reminder of
the fragility of our human
devotion. Still, it gives the idea and
gives way to the boundless grace and
faithfulness of our savior.
My desire, my hope, which is our I hope
our hope is that we strive to be the
bride that reflects the holiness and
love of Jesus Christ, our bridegroom.
That we forsake all idols and worldly
distractions and clinging to the one who
laid down his life for
us. Obeying Christ is fundamental to the
Christian faith. involves following his
teachings, living according to his
example, and hearing to the commandments
he
established. Obedience, obedience to
Christ reflects one's commitment to him
and is often seen acts of love, service,
and devotion. This obedience leads to
spiritual growth in a closer
relationship.
May we as individuals and as the body of
Christ renew our vows to him daily,
declaring with unwavering hearts like
the writer of Song of Solomon said in
63, I am my beloveds and my beloved is
mine. If you feel the need or if you're
looking to put on Christ, please come
now as we stand and sing.
