Good evening everybody.
Well, I see two good things already this
evening. One, uh the elders allowed me
to get back up here and speak again. Uh
and two, we actually had some people
show up, so I didn't run y'all off. Uh
and I praise God for that. Uh but I uh I
really want to thank everyone for your
encouragement this morning. Um that was
a tough lesson uh that I prepared and a
tough lesson for me to um present to you
guys um because it was very personal. Uh
that was a journey that I've been going
you know through for the last
I don't know six to eight months and and
I'm sure some of you guys have been
going through that journey for for much
much longer uh maybe than I have. And so
it was just uh it pricked my heart and
it's just something that I wanted to
share with you guys. So I appreciate the
encouragement and I appreciate um
you guys hearing it with an open heart.
I I hope that it uh it blessed you.
Tonight uh we're going to have a little
bit of a of a two-part
lesson. And this is I I was going to say
this is the first time I've ever tried
this, but this is only like the fourth
time I've been up here. So, um, not like
I've had a lot of experience trying
different things. So, uh, it's kind of a
two-part lesson. You'll see, uh, where
I'm going with it, but we're going to
look at, uh, the idea
of holy
ambition. And, uh, let's, if you will,
let's start with a prayer.
Holy Father, we come to you now just
thanking you so much for this beautiful
day. Lord, we thank you for just another
opportunity to to get together, to
worship you, to lift praises up to you,
uh, Father, to put our lives aside,
and to focus on you. And, uh, we are
just grateful that we can do so freely.
uh that we can do so without fear of
persecution or fear of
stress or physical harm.
And so we're thankful for that blessing,
but we're thankful for all of the
blessings uh that you give to us and and
the greatest of all being your son Jesus
Christ. And father, as we look tonight
again at what you have done for us
through him,
we just ask that you will help us to
realize
uh not only what you've done, but what
you've intended
uh for us in what you've done for us.
And so we father we just ask uh as we go
through your word uh that you will open
our eyes and open our ears and let us
hear and let us see your will and your
intent.
We ask all this through Christ's name.
Amen.
All right. Again, two-part lessoning uh
lesson. Uh we're going to look, like I
said, at holy ambition. Uh, and I know
ambition is a it's an interesting word
to use in I guess kind of a religious
or or spiritual
standpoint. Ambition is usually very
self centered, very self focused.
But I believe uh that we as Christians
should have a holy ambition.
We should want to accomplish things for
God. We should want to accomplish things
for his kingdom.
Um,
one because the Bible tells us to.
Uh, but two, because we have a
realization of what God has done for us.
And so this evening, that's what I want
to to look at. Uh, I have a list here.
uh holy ambition uh to have holy
ambition or for your ambition to be holy
uh five things. It should be driven by
God's glory. We talked about that a
little bit this morning. It should be
empowered by God's grace. We're going to
look at that this evening. It should be
motivated
by love for Christ. We touched on that
this morning. We're going to touch on it
a little bit this evening.
It should be aligned with God's purpose.
And we're going to look at that this
evening as well. And then lastly, for it
to be holy and for it to actually be
ambition, it has to be pursued
through obedience.
I if we're not actively trying to
do God's will, if we're not actively
trying to accomplish something, that's
not ambition. That's just a wish.
I don't want to call it hope. It's just
a wish. It's wishful thinking.
And so in order to have, I guess, the
characteristics
of holy ambition, there are three things
that I want to look at in Ephesians 2 uh
verses 1-10 this evening. And we have to
have an accurate view of ourselves
without Christ.
The second thing is we have to have a
high view of God's work in Christ.
And then lastly, we have to have a
renewed view of God's purpose
uh for us with Christ.
Uh, Ch Mole says that the converts are
to be reminded what they have been
delivered from as well as what they have
been lifted into. They must be led to
look down again into the pit into the
grave from which grace called them out
and set them free.
Excuse me. Uh and and I think that's
exactly what uh the Apostle Paul has
done here in Ephesians uh chapter 2. And
so we'll we'll dive in.
That was the scripture reading
uh that we read just a minute ago. Here
we go. Number one.
So an accurate view of oursel tells us
that we have been revived
from
ruin.
Ephesians 2 verse one says, "And you he
made alive." That's revival. Uh who were
dead in trespasses
and sin. And so we must remember
uh who we were without Christ. We must
remember that we were not only dead in
trespass, but that we were also dead in
sin. And those are those are two
different things. Trespass is uh you've
just crossed a line. A trespass is you
have challenged
God's boundary. Uh but a sin is
different. A a sin is actually failure.
So trespass, we are pushing the line.
Sin, we have crossed that line and we
have actually uh failed against God. I
was talking to Lizzie this morning uh
about the difference between
um our physical kind of death, our
physical lostness, if you will, and then
our spiritual death or our spiritual uh
lost lostness. And there is a difference
of us without Christ. Physically, we're
still alive, right? There are many out
there today uh who are without Christ,
who are walking, talking, breathing,
living, you know, fairly decent lives
for themselves,
but physically they are lost.
Spiritually they are more than lost.
They are spiritually dead.
And that is no difference than where we
were
before we were called to Christ. And so
we need to we need to remember that
physically I I was using this analogy or
uh a literal illustration uh with Lizzy
today. Uh physically, right? Uh if
before we knew Christ, we were out in
the great depths of the ocean and the
waves were crashing and we were just
flailing for our lives trying to keep
afloat. And we were just waiting for
somebody to come throw us a lifeline.
Without Christ though, spiritually,
we weren't doing anything.
We were sunk to the bottom to the depths
of the ocean, spiritually dead
without Christ.
And so just saying dead doesn't really
give a good uh
I guess explanation
of
our situation without Christ. Uh Mark
chapter 2 says that we're sick. Uh 2
Corinthians 4 says that we're blind. Uh
Luke 15 you see that we are lost. uh
parable of the lost sheep, the lost
coin, and the prodigal son. Later in
Ephesians chapter 2, Paul says that we
are aliens, we were strangers, and we
were foreigners.
Uh he says in Romans 6, that we were
slaves to sin.
John 3:19 and 20, everybody knows John
3:16. I love to keep reading.
And it says that we are lovers of
darkness.
without Christ. Um verse three, which
we'll read here in just a second, says
that we are a child or children of
wrath.
And then Colossians 1:13, and it's um
referenced here, but that we are under
the power of darkness.
And so that's who we are without Christ.
And I don't know if it's I I don't know
why I am so
passionate
about making sure that we understand
the gospel. I love what Vodie Bacham
says. He says the gospel doesn't make
bad men good.
It makes dead men alive.
And that's what Paul is saying here at
the very beginning. God has made us
alive when we were dead in our trans
trespasses and sins.
Should have grabbed some water. I
apologize. Uh verse two, in which you
once walked according to the course of
this world, according to the prince of
the power of the air, the spirit who now
works in the sons of disobedience,
among whom also we all once conducted
ourselves in the lusts of our flesh,
fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
of the mind, and were by nature children
of wrath just as others. And so what
Paul is saying here, hey, this is who we
were before Christ. This is how we
walked
before Christ.
Now that we are in Christ, now that we
have been revived, we no longer walk
like that.
So all the talk this morning
about the gospel justifying us and Jesus
his blood justifying us
comes with some implications.
It comes if we truly understand what he
has done for us. It changes us inside.
Not just the gospel is also not about
behavior modification.
We saw that this morning with the
Pharisees. Man, I got a personal
assistant.
I also should have put a $100 in my
pocket before I got up here.
Sorry.
It's worth a try.
So the revived man no longer walks
according to the course of the world. A
a revived man no longer walks according
to the prince of the power of the air.
I think of a a dead man in a coffin.
Uh
not even put into the ground yet. just
say uh at the viewing a and somehow he's
revived to life and it's a closed casket
and he's revived to life. Do you think
that man or that woman is going to want
to stay in that coffin?
No. They're going to be claustrophobic.
U they might pass away again from an
anxiety attack, but but they're not.
They're going to do anything they can to
get out of that coffin.
uh dead men are comfortable in their
trespasses and their sin.
Revived uh people who have been revived
and brought back to life in Jesus Christ
are no longer comfortable in their sin.
And and Paul talks about that in Romans
6 and 7 and and chapters 8. Uh
continue sinning so grace may abound.
Absolutely not. Right? We have been
revived.
We were once dead with no hope and we
have now been revived and brought back
to life. What killed us is
uncomfortable.
What killed us is overwhelming and we
don't want anything
to do with it.
And so
we have been revived from our ruin.
We've also been raised by God's rich
mercy. Uh verse four it says, "But God
who is rich in mercy because of his
great love with which he loved us." Uh
Adam Clark says that as they were
corrupt in their nature and sinful in
their practice, they could possess no
merit nor have any claim upon God.
and it required much mercy to remove so
much misery and to pardon such
transgressions.
So this revival, this raising that we're
going to look at in just a second, this
is done by God. This is done because of
God's mercy
and it's done because of his love. It's
not because we are lovable.
But it's because of who God is. It's
because God is love himself.
Psalm 103 uh:es 8-12 says that the Lord
is merciful and gracious. He is slow to
anger and abounding in mercy. He will
not always strive with us, nor will he
keep his anger forever. He has not dealt
with us according to our sins, nor
punished us according to our iniquities.
And so God, the mercy of God,
I the grace of God, we'll look at that
in just a minute, it is overflowing.
He does not run out of mercy.
He can't run out of mercy because he's
very clear in the Old Testament that
that is one of his characteristics.
And so if you worship a God of the Old
Testament who is anger and wrath,
but you leave out the God of the New
Testament who is merciful
and graceful
and loving,
you've created an idol.
and you are worshiping an idol
because the God of the Old Testament
that has anger and wrath
also has the love and the mercy and the
grace in the Old Testament. And the God
of the New Testament that has love and
mercy and grace also still has the
capability of anger and wrath. And so
the same way if we just look at God as
loving and merciful and uh everything's
great, no worries, I can do what I want.
We've also created an idol and we are
worshiping an idol. We need to worship
the one true God in his entirety.
We can't pick and choose what we want
from God. He is what he is. He does not
change. And that is who we worship. And
that is the same God who has lifted us
up. The same God who let the Israelites
go through struggles
and get taken in to Babylonian
captivities. The same God that freed
them from Egypt.
God is God.
picking up in verse five. Even when we
are dead in trespasses, see it again,
made us alive together with Christ. By
grace you have been saved.
I'm going to say this and and this was
really hard for me to even think about.
We have to stop
trying to make ourselves lovable to God.
His
love that we see right here started when
we were dead in our trespasses.
He loved us as dead men
who contradicted his will, who
contradicted
his commandments.
When we had absolutely nothing to give
to him, he still chose to love us. And
so if we are just going about trying to
work hard to make ourselves lovable,
we're missing out on God's grace.
That is his grace. The fact that he
loved us when we had nothing to give.
Grace is undeserved favor.
And we saw this morning we there's
nothing we could do to deserve his
favor.
And sometimes I wonder why Christians
are or are myself, I'm including myself
in this, are so
anxious
and we're so worried
and we are trying so hard.
When the New Testament tells us that in
Jesus we will have peace,
that in Jesus we will have rest for our
souls.
It's hard. We struggle. I struggle to
accept his grace daily.
I was raised to be very proud. I want to
earn everything I'm given. I don't want
handouts.
We can't earn this. And until we realize
that, we are going to be anxious and
overwhelmed and spinning our wheels
trying to achieve something we could
never achieve.
So God's grace, even when we're dead in
trespasses, he has made us alive
together with Christ. By grace you have
been saved. Verse six, and he raised us
up together and made us sit together in
the heavenly places with Jesus Christ.
With Christ Jesus, excuse me. So, we've
been raised up. We're at the bottom of
the ocean and now we've been raised up.
We don't sit in the heavenly places with
Jesus right now. Um,
at least from what I've been told, I
hope heaven's a lot better than here.
We don't sit in the heavenly places with
him right now. But we do sit in the
heavenly places in him
right now.
We have a new life and a new identity in
Christ. And Christ who was raised to the
right hand of the father after his
resurrection is in the heavenly places.
And my identity is in him. Which means
now my identity is in the heavenly
places.
Uh Adam Clark says again, "And now we
sit in heavenly places. We have a right
to the kingdom of God. We anticipate
this glory and we are indescribably
happy in the possession of this
salvation
and in our fellowship with Christ
Jesus." That's the opposite of an
anxious. That's the opposite of
overwhelming.
We have confidence.
We anticipate it. We're incredibly happy
as we wait for it.
So, we have been raised up by God's rich
mercy. Number three, we have been
redeemed by his radical
grace. Verse 7 says that in the ages to
come he might show the exceeding
riches of his grace and his kindness
towards us in Christ Jesus.
God's work in us.
This morning we talked about God's work
for us through Jesus on the cross.
But God's work
in us, this transformation
that we're talking about
is all about God's glory,
right? It It's not about our glory. God
has raised us up and he is now working
through us by his mercy with his grace
to be transformed into something new so
that we can glorify him.
And he's going to continue to work with
his church for his glory.
and he's going to continue to work in us
on a basis of grace. His grace is
overflowing.
Um
his grace is
a gift and the thing about gifts is you
have to either accept them or reject
them.
Have you ever bought something for
somebody and um they didn't want it?
Maybe you got them a Christmas present
and they didn't really like it that much
and they say, "Hey, you know what? I'm
going to go exchange this."
And we sit here and we say, "Hi, God.
Grace,
I know your grace is pretty cool.
Um, but I'd rather like, I don't know,
money.
Could you bless me with money instead?
God's grace is a gift to us that we have
to uh accept. Verse eight, for by grace
you have been saved through faith
and that is not of yourselves.
I've struggled to understand this. Have
you guys Have you guys struggled to
understand this? How we are saved by
grace through faith? Is it grace?
Is it faith? Can I be saved by grace
without the faith?
Can I be saved by faith without the
grace?
I've struggled to understand it. Um, but
I did see an illustration that kind of
helped uh helped it make sense. And I
don't see is Les Riddle here tonight?
Nope. I'm going to I get in trouble for
calling him out every time I am up here
speaking and I didn't do it this
morning. So, uh, back when, you know,
Les Riddle and I used to cut grass, uh,
we would get really hot and we would
drink from, uh, a water hose. Those are
the good old days, uh, when the water
hoses went right into the ponds. And and
so drinking from this water hose,
the water flowed
through the hose,
but it wasn't the hose that quenched my
thirst.
Okay?
So
the hose is the channel, not the cause.
So God's grace comes through our faith.
And so our faith is the channel that we
receive God's grace, but our faith is
not the cause.
Had that water hose been, I don't know,
connected to a toilet,
I'd have been drinking toilet water, not
pond water.
If my faith is connected to anything
else other than God,
I'm going to receive something else. I
don't know what, but it's not going to
be God's grace.
The hose is connected to a gas pump. I'm
going to receive gas through the hose.
So, what are we putting what are we
putting our faith in? God could have
chose to send us anything through our
faith, but he chose
grace.
But the hose is important, right? The
faith is important. We we mentioned
earlier that grace is undeserved,
undeserved favor. Grace is also
something else. Grace is power for
living. It's not just undeserved favor.
It's power for living. uh 1 Corinthians
15:10 Paul says, "But by the grace of
God, I am what I am. And his grace
towards me was not in vain, but I
labored more abundantly than they all.
Yet not I, but the grace of God which
was with me." And so what Paul is doing
is by the grace of God. Paul is
empowered by the grace of God. The grace
of God is working in Paul. 2 Corinthians
9 and verse 8. And God is able to make
all grace abound towards you, that you
always having all sufficiency in all
things may have an abundance
for every good work.
You know what that sounds like to me?
Sounds like we don't have an excuse not
to do good works.
By the grace of God, we are see in a
minute called to good works. We don't
have an excuse. God's grace is
sufficient for us to continue in our
good works.
God's grace also gives us the power to
believe. Our faith is not a gift. Our
ability to have faith is a gift.
And so he's gifted us with a choice. We
can choose to have faith or we can
choose not to have faith.
He doesn't
make us have faith. If he made us have
faith, that wouldn't be a gift. And so
God's grace gives us the power to
believe. Our faith is our choice.
It's my choice if I want to pick up the
hose and I want to connect it to the
water spet.
Charles Spurgeon says, "When all the
saints shall be gathered home, they
shall still talk and speak of the
wonders of Jehovah's love in Christ
Jesus. And in the golden streets they
shall stand up and tell what the Lord
has done for them to the listening
crowds of angels and principalities
and powers.
God has blessed us so
immensely.
Without him we have no hope whatsoever.
Without him, we are dead in our
trespasses.
But he has revived us. He has
Oh, sorry. What was number two? Um,
going mind blank.
Raised us. Thank you, Miss Epler.
Somebody's paying attention. He has
revived us. He has raised us. And he has
redeemed us. And so I have an accurate
view of myself without Christ. I am dead
with no hope at the bottom of the ocean.
And I see a very high view of God who
has by his grace in his rich mercy and
out of his immense love for me
has raised me up,
revived me and has redeemed me.
And so that should do something to us.
It should do something to us, but it
doesn't always. And so what we see here
in verse 10
is that we are restored
for good works. Paul says,"For we are
his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus
for good works, which God prepared
beforehand
that we should walk in them." We are his
workmanship. He wants to make something
beautiful out of us.
It wasn't just enough to bring us back
to life.
He wants to make us beautiful. Isaiah
64:8 says, "But now, Lord, you are our
father. We are the clay and you are the
potter. We are all the work of your
hand." And so this uh the Jerusalem
Bible translates uh his workmanship to
uh we are his work of art.
So in what we have been now created for,
it is just naturally going to give glory
to God.
If we stay true to the purpose,
if we stay true to what we've been
called to,
God shapes us. He transforms us.
And this is the thing about his love. I
mentioned earlier that we shouldn't try
to earn his love or become more lovable
for him. The thing is his love, it meets
us where we are,
but it takes us to where we should be.
If we just stop trying,
if we just honestly surrender ourselves,
quit trying to do it our way
and let him work in us.
Let him create us into what he wants us
to be.
But that's hard.
That's surrender. It's submission.
We get all worked up about Ephesians 5,
submitting to one another, submitting to
our wives, and blah blah blah. And you
want me to submit to somebody I can't
even see,
who I can only hear from when I
It's difficult.
That's where faith comes in.
The love of God that saves my soul
is also going to change my life.
And so we are being shaped and we are
being created for good works. God uh
prepared those works
beforehand, which means that was his
plan all along.
This wasn't just some new thing. Hey,
I'm going to, you know, crucify Jesus
and then I'm going to ask you to go tell
everybody about it and then I want you
to love your neighbor and uh go to
church and build one another up. God
intended this for us from the very
beginning all the way back to Adam and
Eve. He knew we would be here right now
worshiping
one another.
And so that means that even my good
works
come from God. He is working in me. He
is working through me. If I have
surrendered and submitted myself to him,
my good works even come from him.
And so we go back to the idea of
legalism and justification from this
morning.
I don't have to try.
I don't have to work so hard.
All I have to do is just give up my
desires.
All I have to do is give up anything
that is contradictory to God's word and
to God's will. just have to fully submit
myself to him. And he is naturally going
to work through me
to become something that is pleasing to
him,
to become something that is going to
give him glory,
to become something that is going to
honor him and praise him
if I just submit
to him.
And so we see from Ephesians 2:es 1-10
that God has revived us from our ruin.
He has raised us by his rich rich mercy.
He has redeemed us by his radical grace
and he has restored us for righteous
works. So how do we
kind of just answered that uh but how do
we continue in good works?
How do we continue in obedience? How do
we continue in attendance?
I don't get so hung up on those things.
They're extremely important. But we are
called to so much more
than just coming to church.
We are called to so much more
than just welcoming a new neighbor to
the neighborhood.
Good things to do.
How do we make an eternal impact
for God? How do we have a holy ambition?
one that is not for our personal gain uh
but is for God's glory. I'm going to run
you through this is a book that I was
reading.
There's five things. Um I I don't
remember the gentleman's name who wrote
the book. Um but there are five things.
He has six. I cut one out. Um
but there's five things he lists that we
have to have to ensure that we are
having uh that we have holy ambition. He
says the very very first thing is a
dislocated heart. Uh this is a god-given
concern
uh that propels us beyond our
comfortable routines.
It's a passionate concern for God's
people and God's agenda
that supersedes our own personal comfort
and our agenda.
And I would encourage you if you want to
take these five down and go read the
entire book runs through the story and
the the book of Nehemiah. It it's
fantastic to see these line up with the
scriptures. Uh the second thing he says
is that we have to have a broken spirit.
Uh this is an attitude of humility. It
is self aacing. Uh it is a spirit and an
attitude of absolute dependency and need
for God.
And you say man Christians are supposed
to be powerful.
Christians are supposed to be brave.
Christians are post supposed to stand
and fight. How does a dislocated heart
and a broken spirit help me have a holy
ambition? Help me do God's will.
Uh Isaiah 57,
uh before we go there,
I would encourage you uh to go read
Psalm 51.
In Psalm 51, David is
uh pleading to God. He is repenting
to God. And he he's going through it's
after his sin with Bashibba and uh he's
going through and he's talking about
everything
that he's done.
He knows that he has hurt God. He knows
that he has sinned against God.
And in verse 10 of Psalm 51, he says,
"Create in me a clean heart, oh God, and
renew a steadfast
spirit within me. Do not cast me away
from your presence. Do not take your
holy spirit from me. Then I will teach
your uh transgressors your ways, and
sinners shall be converted to you."
Oh. Uh verse 15. Oh Lord, open my lips
and my mouth shall show forth your
praise. 16 For you do not desire
sacrifice, or else I would give it. You
do not delight in burnt offering. The
sacrifices of God are a broken spirit
and a broken and contrite heart. These,
oh God, you will not despise. So
King David tells us that God wants us to
have a contrite heart and a broken
spirit. Turning back to Isaiah 57 and
verse1 15
uh it says for thus says the high and
lofty one who inhabits eternity whose
name is holy I dwell in the high and
holy place with him who has a contrite
and humble spirit
to revive the spirit of the humble and
to revive the heart of the contrite
ones.
God wants us to have a dislocated heart.
He wants us to have a broken spirit so
that he can revive us.
He wants us to stop. He wants us to
rest. He wants us to let him
revive us.
And then from that accurate view of self
where we are, this isn't self demeaning.
This isn't a sense of talking so bad
about myself that uh you know I make
myself feel bad. That's not humility.
Humility is not talking less of
yourself. It's just talking of yourself
less. It's putting others
first.
Third thing, radical faith. Uh this
doesn't mean that you're not afraid, but
it does mean that you're willing to act
despite your fears. Uh it means that you
are going to choose to step out to
fulfill God's will at possible great
personal risk and sacrifice. Personal
commitment is kind of a given to me. Um
I mean, you've got to have if you want
to do anything uh in life, you have to
commit to it. You have to dedicate to
it. uh you can't just wander around and
expect to get stuff done, right? You
have to dedicate to it. And then
courageous soul. Uh we've got to stand
firm when others flee.
We have to stay true to the Bible. When
the world wants us to go the other way,
we cannot be run off.
We must have courage to do the right
things at the right time
for the right reasons.
And so basically
I'm going to take it all the way back to
the to the very beginning.
If we have an accurate view of ourselves
and we have a high view of God,
an accurate view of ourselves is
naturally going to create a high view of
God.
And we renew ourselves to our purpose in
Christ.
We're not texting each other saying,
"Hey, you going to be at church on
Sunday morning?"
Yeah.
I don't want to be anywhere else.
We're not texting each other and saying,
"Hey, man. Harrison said we got to help
somebody move. You going to be there?"
Yeah,
I am.
This is not done out of a a need. This
is not done out of an obligation. It's
done out of gratitude because I am so
grateful for what God has done for me in
Jesus.
So I pray
that even with this impact ministry that
we have uh but all the ministries that
we have the church in general I pray
that we can have a holy ambition.
One that seeks to do nothing but serve
God to serve our purpose in God. and one
that submits to let him work through us.
We don't have all the answers.
That's why we need God.
If I had all the answers, I don't need
God.
I need God. I don't have all the
answers. So, I need to submit to what he
wants for me.
I know this hasn't been very
encouraging.
Um, but I was also trying not to get uh
somebody told me I went real preacher
this morning and I don't know what that
means. Um, I was trying not to do that
tonight. So, uh, but I hope this has
been encouraging to you. I hope it's at
least provoked some thought. Uh,
and uh, if you guys need anything at
all, please come forward while we stand
and while we sing.
