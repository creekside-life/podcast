Harry Emerson fosic uh was a preacher
who died back in the 60s but he was a
preacher but as a child he was asked
well not ask he was back in the day they
didn't mom and dad didn't ask you they
told you right so Mom told him to go and
get pick a quart of
raspberries well you know kids do what
they're told back in the day but they
did it grudgingly and you know mumbling
under their breath so he grudgingly
drugg himself to the berry patch and in
his mind his whole afternoon was ruined
he had plans you know I'm going to play
with my friend I'm going to do this and
now my whole day is ruined then a
thought hit
him maybe I could surprise my mom and
pick not one quart of berries but two
courts and suddenly the
drudgery of picking berries became a
challenge that he
enjoyed and not only did he enjoy it but
he accomplished it and it was a job that
didn't change it was still the same job
and he still wasn't getting to play with
his friends but suddenly it was a joy a
joy that he said 50 years later was one
of his greatest memories of taking home
two quarts to his mother and all all
that changed was his
attitude that's all that changed the job
was still the
same you know we do not trust
ourselves to be faithful at least I
don't I probably most of you do not
trust yourself to be a faithful
Christian I don't trust myself to be a
faithful Christian and it's right to not
trust me it's right for you not to trust
me if if you see me do something that
you're shocked and said I believe Rex do
that you shouldn't be shocked I'm a
human like you and I bet you surprised
yourself a couple of times I know I've
surprised myself help myself do I'm what
in the world am I doing so Philippians
3:3 says we are the circumcision who
worship God in the spirit rejoice in
Christ Jesus and have no confidence in
the
flesh I don't have any confidence in the
flesh now George dfield wrote back in
1858 the third stanza of a song we all
know stand up stand up for Jesus you
know that song let's read the third
stanza it says this stand up stand up
for Jesus stand in his strength alone
the arm of Flesh will fail you you dare
not trust your own
put on the gospel armor each piece put
on with prayer where duty calls or
danger be never wanting there the point
is is that the strength is not me I
can't do what I think I should do every
time I think I should do it Paul makes
this argument in Romans but Matthew 19:
16 a man comes to Jesus and says what
good things shall I do that I may have
eternal life I want to do something that
once I've done that thing I know I will
have eternal life there's no such
thing but but baptism no there's no such
thing see we want to know what we can do
not not just to have a hope of going to
heaven we want to know what we can do
that guarantees it I got it I once I do
that I've got
it so what do we do we argue with each
other about things like this we talk
about in Bible classes uh we need to
pray more we need to read our Bible more
we need to do more
no that's not going to do
it that's not it
uh but because if it is of
Grace and not of
works then the guarantee is actually
different it's actually different than
that maybe it's not what you do but
rather our
inclination our
attitude our spirit that matters now
that sounds contradictory but it's not
stay with me it is the spirit
underneath that makes it possible not
the other way around the doing isn't
what makes it possible if you want to be
faithful forever listen to these
scriptures 2 Corinthians 1:22 we also
have se he who also has sealed us and
given us the spirit in our hearts as a
guarantee the change
within is what guarantees me reaching
the
end uh 2 Corinthians 5:5 now he who has
prepared us for this very thing is God
who also has given us the spirit as a
guarantee the change
within is what guarantees me reaching
the
end and listen to this one Ephesians
chapter 1 verses 13-4 in him you also
trusted after you heard the word of the
truth the gospel of your salvation in
whom also having believed you were
sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise
who is the guarantee of our inheritance
until the Redemption of the purchas
possession with the praise of his glory
so the change
within is what
guarantees I make it to the end it is
that attitude shift that inclination
it is about our inclinations not the
Deeds it's about our inclination to the
Deeds it is about our attitude about
doing the deed not about the deed itself
it is about our Direction not the actual
accomplishment but the effort because of
the direction you're headed and it's
about our spirit and our spirit
guarantees us reaching the end but if
your spirit's not been changed if you
still got the same attitude you had when
you were baptized you might not make
it it's
serious it's not a joke so I just look
at three inclinations of heart in this
text I hope you turn to this text Psalm
119 is great text short little passage
but uh it's great great passage we just
look at three inclinations of the heart
that make it possible to answer the
question how do I incline my heart to
obey God forever if you can stay awake I
know this that rain's really helping is
it it's just I'm
going anyway if you can stay with me
here we go number one here we go to
Incline my heart to obey God
forever what I do I must hate all the
instability not just like
it I must hate it within
listen to what he says I know this may
sound strange people saywell you're a
Christian you don't hate anything you
hate wrong and if you don't hate wrong
you're not a Christian you just sayin
wrong listen to what he says I have
inclined my heart to perform your
statutes
forever to the very end how I hate the
double-minded but I love your law what's
the double-minded well like of First
Kings chapter 18 when Elijah's up on
Mount caral and there they the people
can't make up their mind whether they
want to serve Baal or serve the Lord
that's double mind can't make up my mind
if you can't make up your mind whose
side you're on you got a double
mind and every Christian hates that
Spirit hates it but more than that that
means that we hate
instability statements that are unstable
or unsubstantiated it aren't true Psalm
119 verse 104 says through your precepts
I get understanding therefore I hate
every false way I hate don't you hate it
when you hear somebody lie don't you if
you're a Christian you hate lie you hate
lying wor I mean if you just shading the
truth if you're shading the truth in any
of your business deals you don't hate
it you must hate every false way and if
that's a part of your core your spirit
your inclination you don't have to worry
about it you're going to be faithful in
Psalm 11 19128 says therefore all your
precepts concerning all things I
consider to be right and I hate every
false way when I hear somebody say
something I know and I'm tell the truth
just makes me sick don't it you makes me
sick I hate every false white see the
devil's a
liar God's the truth Devil's a liar if
you about telling little lies little
false Li your you know shading the truth
to different people about different
situation you don't have this Spirit I'm
talking about you don't have it yet you
need to have a change of heart you need
to ask God change your heart listen to
psalm91 163 I I hate and abhor
lying but I love your
law so if you tell lies in your business
deals you don't have the
spirit and I don't know if you're going
to make
it but if you want to make it to the end
and forever serve the Lord get the
spirit I hate any kind of lie any kind
of
misrepresentation
absolutely hate it so I'm must have the
spirit that's inclined to hate every
form of any instability not exactly you
know when they can't even make up their
mind are you lying well in a way you're
lying to yourself any form of wavering
any form of double-mindedness any form
of double speak any form of
falsehood that's a good place to start
the second
truth is to Incline my heart to obey God
forever I must
hide in the Lord listen to what it says
this is not me verse 14
114 you are talking to
God
you are my Hiding Place and my
shield I hope in your word Psalm 31:20
says you shall hide them in the secret
place of your presence from the plots of
man you shall keep them secretly in a
pavilion from the stries of tongues you
may not be picking up on what I'm
talking about here hang with me just a
second it's not that complicated and
it's not a mystery you just haven't
thought about
it Psalm 32:7 says you are my Hiding
Place you shall preserve me from trouble
you shall surround me with songs of
Deliverance Psalm 91:1 says he who
dwells in the secret place of the most
high shall abide under the shadow of the
almighty just to be under the shadow of
the almighty here's the
deal Genesis chapter 3 when man first
sinned what did he do hid from
God the tendency within Humanity
is to do wrong and hide from
everybody especially God the last person
you want to speak to right after a sin
often is to pray to
God here's the trick you want to stay
faithful till the very end I must have a
spirit that is inclined to run to God
and hide yes in him from the world and
the Troubles of the world not to hide
from from him the troubles I've
created I must divulge everything that
I've done wrong before him I hide in him
by his grace I am saved through faith
it's not of my works it is his grace and
his extension I want to hide under the
shadow of the Almighty I want to hide in
the secret place of his Pavilion who am
I hiding from I'm hiding from the world
not from
God I'm hiding from sin but not from God
so to Incline my heart to obey God
forever I need to hide in the Lord are
you running to God every time something
goes down every time you skin your knee
like a little kid do you run to the
father or do you run to your sin and
hide with your fig
leaves number
three to Incline my heart to obey God
forever I must hope in the Lord so I
must hate all false
ways any kind of
instability I must hide in the Lord but
I must if I want to be faithful forever
I must hope in the word of God listen to
what he says beginning in verse 14 114
again it says you are my Hiding Place
and my shield I hope in your word not in
my job not in the money in my bank
account not in my health not in all the
things my intellect my abilities I don't
hope in those things but I'll tell you
what a lot of Christians do a lot of
Christians get
nervous so
nervous because they hope in their
situation listen to it I hope in your
word depart from me you evildoers for I
will keep the Commandments of my God I
want to be in his word uphold me
according to your word I want to be in
your word and your promises that I may
live and do not let me be ashamed of my
hope I have hoped in your word listen to
Psalm 119:81 says my soul faints for
your salvation I mean I I want to see it
right I'm weary tired I want to see your
salvation my soul faints for your
salvation but even with that but my
hope is in your
word how am I going to make it to the
end of the month let's say you run out
of money how you going to make it at the
end of the month the word of
God how you going to make it if you
don't feel well the word of God how you
going to get up today if you're
depressed the word of God you're going
to get up because you suddenly things
that church made it better known no it's
the word of God it's the only thing
that's going to help you it's the only
thing going to give you hope Psalm 11947
says I Rise before the dawning of the
morning and cry for
help I hope in your
word so it's not science there no
scientific expl there's no medicine you
think medicine's going to give you hope
medicine cannot give you hope you're
going to die and they know it all they
do is bandage stuff there's no solution
in medicine there's no solution in
science there's no rocket going to Mars
that tomorrow will make us live
forever there's no science there's no
philosophy oh well tomorrow we'll be
really smart and we'll figure out how to
live in this world there's no philosophy
to sort this out there's no psychology
psychology that's a study of your soul
anyway you think that men can study your
soul without reading the Bible and come
up with a psychology that can really
solve all your problems that makes sense
wow I should have all of that clearly
not there is no politics so you think
the politics of this world somehow we
get the right guy in the right place at
the right place doing the right thing
and no it's all going to be resolve
that's ridiculous it's not going to
happen so what do I do in dayto day what
do I put my hope in my circumstance my
politics my science My Philosophy my
math skills my
psychology I must have the spirit that
is in incline to Only Hope in God's word
folks this has answers for your life you
want to know what to do with your life
read this thing quit expecting the
preacher to develop it on Sunday morning
and suddenly you'll just know everything
you need to know because I preached a
great sermon that ain't going to happen
you need to read your Bible every day
not because reading your Bible get you
into heaven because the information
gives you hope so inclin to Only Hope in
God's word God's truth God's promises
not to trust in my abilities or my
understanding or or my situation I mean
you just can't do that it won't resolve
your problems so here's the lesson it's
simple how to Incline my heart to obey
God forever not just for a week not just
for a month not just till I get
old but to Incline my heart to obey God
forever I must hate
all instability and
lies that sets you on a course if you
truly hate it it sets your feet on a
course of
truth I must hide in the Lord that sets
your feet on a path to run to God not
away from God when things go
wrong and I hope in the word that sets
your path to pick this up instead of the
newspaper to figure out what you ought
to be doing so being inclined in my
heart to obey God forever is not a
work it is a
spirit it is an inclination within it's
a desire it's an attitude and it is a
guarantee from the scriptures if you
have that new spirit you have the
guarantee that will deliver you at the
end so it's not so much what I
do as what I'm inclined to
be in the
spirit
hummingbird is an interesting little
creature it lives in the desert you ever
seen them in the desert they're
beautiful see stopped at a volcano one
time and there there hundreds of
hummingbirds around this little little
store vultures live in the desert you
notice that too interesting enough they
don't look for the same thing see
vultures fly over the desert and they
look for something dead something rotten
something
stinky they thrive on
it hummingbirds on the other hand ignore
all that stuff and they're looking for
some sweet Desert Blossom
vultures live on what
was they live on the past and they feed
on what's gone hummingbirds live on what
is they seek New Life what's about to
bloom they fill themselves with
freshness and life and
sweetness here's the
truth each of those
birds find what they're looking
for
that's a
spirit you find what you
seek Sir Christopher
Ren was a English guy he was an
architect he was a lot of thing
astronomer a mathematician a physicist
he's probably the most acclaimed
architect of his day in the history of
England maybe even he dealt in What's
called the Baroque
style he was after the burning up the
fire of 1666 of London that destroyed so
much of London and so many of their
churches he was given the responsibility
to rebuild 52 churches in
London excuse me but his most wonderful
achievement in that work his Masterpiece
is really St Paul's Cathedral at luggate
Hill which he completed in
1710 I just want to tell you a story
about what happened when they were
building that when when they were
building that
back uh Sir Christopher Ren was around
but you didn't see him much but there
were workers there every day so a
newspaper reporter decided that what
they would do is they' go around and
come up with an article by asking
different people who worked there what
they were doing the question was what
are you doing walked up to one man what
are you doing he said well I'm cutting
Stu own for 10 Shillings a day I don't
know how much a shilling is but you get
the message that's what he's doing 10
Shillings a day went up to the next man
what are you doing he said well I'm
putting in 10 hours a day on this job
walked up to the third man what are you
doing said well I'm helping Sir
Christopher Ren construct one of
London's greatest Cathedrals you see all
it is is a difference in your attitude
it's a shift in your spirit it's what
you're looking for you know if you want
to wonder why some people will quit the
church I have just explained it in such
detail you should never be mystified
again it has everything to do with your
spirit it has nothing to do with your
Deeds it has everything to do with your
spirit and what you're looking for if
you're looking for dead things you will
find them I promise you you will find
them if you're looking for sweet nectar
you will find it I promise you you will
if you're looking for
lying you will find it and you will
leave
us if you're running from the Lord you
will get away from him and you will
leave us if you're running from not
hoping in the word you will leave the
Bible on a shelf one day and never pick
it up again but if you want to serve the
Lord forever and commit to him forever
then you will change your spirit and
your heart and you will hate with a
passion any form of a lie no matter who
speaks it including
yourself and you will run to the Lord
and hide in the Lord to protect you to
save you to forgive you and you will
pick up your Bible and you will hope in
every word you read it when you get down
you'll pick it up again again and you'll
read it again now let me explain
something to you you know the scripture
is really clear about
this in Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 15
and 16 it says this if they had called
now these are the people who left you
know ER of cise talking about those
people if they had called to mind that
country from which they had come out
they would have had opportunity to
return but now they desire a better
better that is a Heavenly country now
listen to that just a second I need to
read that again I don't think you got it
listen to
this if they had called to mind that
country the way of the world before he
became a Christian if they had called to
mind that country from which they had
come out they would have had opportunity
to
return where are your where's your
mind what you set up
there it is it's your
spirit it's all up to you it's not
something you do it's something that
changes within you've either been
changed or you
haven't and we can't fix that I got
nothing but you can make a decision
today you can decide to believe in Jesus
today say I believe that Jesus Christ is
risen Lord and Savior you can decide to
repent change your heart see you can
decide that change your heart it's
called repentance and you can confess
Christ you we can baptize you today
plenty of water available today
apparently you can do it it's strictly
up to you but if that heart doesn't
change we just got you
wet change your
heart follow the lord
forever I that's how simple it is if you
need to come come while we stand and
while we sing
