I want to start off by reading a song
some of you may recognize
this early this morning when you knocked
upon my door early this morning oo when
you knocked upon my door and I said
hello Satan I believe it's time to go me
and the devil was walking side by side
me and the devil was walking side by
side and I'm going to beat my woman
until I get
satisfied and she said don't see why
that I would dog her around now baby you
know you ain't doing me right don't you
and she say you don't see why woo that I
would dog her around it must have be
that old evil spirit so deep down in the
ground you may bury my body down by the
high side highway side baby I don't care
where you bury my body when I'm dead and
gone you may bury my body down by the
highway side so my old evil spirit can
get a Greyhound bus and ride some of you
might recognize
that seems an interesting way to start
off a graduation uh lesson I guess but
that was Robert Johnson he was a
guitarist back in the day he's actually
credited with uh being the Unapologetic
gritty mood that would later become rock
and
roll he was born in 1911 to a poor
farming family in Mississippi and all he
wanted to do was play the
blues and apparently he wasn't very good
at guitar and then he went away for a
while and came back and he's one of the
best guitarists we've ever heard
apparently and the legend has it that he
was told to go down to the
crossroads and there he met a large man
Satan and uh he handed his guitar over
to Satan and Satan tuned it and the
devil played a few songs and then
returned his guitar to Johnson giving
him the
Mastery of this instrument and in
exchange for his soul Johnson was able
to create the blues for which he became
famous he died at the age of
27 uh while his exact cause of death is
unknown most people believe that he got
wrapped up in a relationship with a
married woman and that he was poisoned
by a jealous
husband seems to be a price that was
paid
there
and so it's
said that uh you meet the devil at the
crossroads right and that's where our
graduates are kind of are right now
they're at the crossroads of of life I
guess and uh they stands the devil I
think it's an apt analogy that you have
these choices in this Crossroad right
maybe that's the Journey of Life a
series of Crossroads but as a Christian
maybe it's more basic maybe it's maybe
it's just a fork in the road you go one
way or the other Matthew 12:30 says you
know
um uh he who is not with me is against
me so maybe it's maybe it's as simple as
that maybe it's just a fork in the road
but I mean you know the saying the
crossroads and so you meet the devil the
temptation to take the easy way out the
temptation to take
shortcuts and so you make a deal with
the devil and he may Elevate you to Fame
and
Fortune uh
but he is the father of lies
right and if you're honest with
yourself you soon realize that there is
no Foundation no depth no real meaning
and no
fulfillment in what he's given you it's
built on this real shallow shallow
foundation and you find yourself worse
off than you were
before
and so I urge you to avoid the
temptation of following the
devil if I can share some wisdom though
with you in my years what I've learned
is this there is always a price and
maybe some of you understand what I'm
saying there's always a price at
whatever decision you might
make uh and I've learned the hard way
for sure and so you step out and you
make a decision and you face the
consequences of that decision and make
no mistake there was always a price with
God
too the difference is is that uh God is
is was and always has been and will be
upfront and honest he calls you to be
hardworking and
dedicated um and it's really the
opposite of what Satan is calling you to
do Satan's giving you the good times
advert with the the hidden costs and the
terms and conditions you know there's
terms and conditions you can't live up
to and those are the decisions Right But
the irony behind this is that the the
hard work and the dedication that God
requires is actually the pathway to the
peace that we're all looking
for you know what I mean that peace that
we're all searching
for and the devil's way just leads to
chaos and an anarchy so in the story of
Cain and
Abel get my notes in the story of Cain
and able we see that these two men these
two brothers they offer up different
sacrifices to God right and one Abel God
finds that or God regards Abel's offer
the Bible says he regards it and the
other one Cain God doesn't regard that
one and so in this encounter with God
God goes to Cain and speaks to him and
it's almost like God gives Cain another
opportunity to be better to offer up a a
sacrifice that will be that will be
accepted he says if he did well it will
be
accepted so it seems to me it's not
about really the contents of the
sacrifice but rather the effort the
thought and the motivation behind it the
lesson seems to highlight the importance
of giving your best
efforts and when we give an improper
sacrifice it seems to portray that we
think we can pull one overrun God you
know when we think we can get away with
it that improper sacrifice when we don't
really think about it we can we start to
get lazy and we think we're going to get
away with it but there always comes a
bill there's a price to pay and at this
point God calls Cain to accountability
he calls us all to this accountability
and so Cain is met with this another
Crossroad of sorts a decision to
make and uh have you ever heard someone
say uh stop you're making it
worse I wish someone had said this to
Cain stop you're making it
worse because when faced with his
Crossroads what did he do his next
decision instead of accepting
responsibility he chooses a path which
leads to murdering his
brother Cain did not give the best of
himself he gave an improper
sacrifice and that improper sacrifice
led to to blood being
spilled so this can be catastrophic for
yourself and for others around you so I
urge you to give the best of yourself
wherever you go whatever you do whatever
you choose to do give the best of
yourself your best sacrifice don't be
tempted to aim down be tempted well not
tempted but aim up
and when you aim up I promise you God
will lift you up that's what he says
right and he will lift you up we sing
that God will lift you up but give the
best of
yourself and and don't you find it
funny that the story that leads after
Canan Abel is the
flood this this chaos that that happened
on the earth real chaos let me let me
break that up a bit the Earth cracked
open the the waters came up from the
from the the Deep um there was rain
there's
winds humans and animals possibly
screaming till their death I'm talking
about serious
chaos that Canan Abel had these
decisions and they went down a pathway
which led to terrible terrible
chaos and at some point in your life you
may find yourself drowning in this kind
of chaos and this suffering and you're
going to ask ask yourself
why and you're going to you're going to
not understand you're going to be
frustrated you possibly going to be
angry with God right and and you're
faced with this unbearable suffering
sometimes and sometimes it leads to
trying to search for an end a horrible
end and I understand you know a lot of
us have been there we get it but no
doubt there are some Fai worse than
death we know that it is tough but I
want you to look to Noah Noah is in this
situation of chaos and and Carnage
really and during that time through this
flood he's witnessing and he's enduring
this this filth and this this
recklessness of the world right and and
knowah is suffering through this but
what did Noah have he had Faith right
for us now to have faith in Christ to
have faith in Jesus is to have faith in
the fundamental goodness in existence
if everything's created through Christ
everything's created for Christ and we
have faith in Christ we have faith in
the fundamental goodness of existence
we're holding on to that hope we're
holding on to man this is going to get
better right and Noah found that Faith
he he had that courage to Man Against
All Odds go and build an ark for how
many years come
again that's a
struggle but but he had the courage to
step up and trust God and he had faith
in God that courage is so important
right and in their face of adversity and
suffering and we know it's not easy I
implore you guys to have faith to have
courage to have that faith in a world
that mocks faith that uh belittles Faith
have the courage to stand up and have
faith take examples from Abraham and
from Noah and from Moses and David and
Enoch and Rahab and and all the lists in
Hebrew
11 and have faith and watch what God can
do each of you have a Divine worth made
with purpose and reason you have
something to offer the world don't
deprive us deprive us of that spectacle
give your best and shine so that others
may
follow I do want to say this young
people learn from the old
people sorry older folks you're
old go and learn from them go and learn
how to listen to the older people if you
want to cheat sheat in life go and
listen they will give you some good tips
right one day you're going to have to do
your taxes go and find someone who's
done it a lot you'll it'll help you out
right learn from the old people
there is coming a time when we will all
face a final
Crossroad the
price that cannot be paid by us is
coming a price that we cannot
pay and that price is
death but for you um there's a deal of a
lifetime if you're willing to
accept God sends his son to pay this
ultimate price
for our corruption and our chaos and he
asks and all he asks is that we have
faith in him and what he can do and what
he will do and in that Faith we'll find
perseverance and we will find Hope and
our hope does not disappoint I love
that so when you're ready down when
you're
struggling keep aiming up make that
decision don't be tempted by Satan to
aim down it leads to destruction in fact
if we really break it down there is no
real decision here we all want peace we
all want love we all want this hope and
this
kindness God offers that Satan
doesn't so really is there a
decision give your
best give your best
sacrifice sacrifice your best for him
him Jesus
literally gave his whole
self in sacrifice to God to show us the
way but not only that he lived in
goodness he lived in kindness he lived
in love right there was no deceit out of
his mouth he was the best sacrifice
there could be and then he gave it all
up to God not for
himself but for God and for us and
that's what we're call to do this is not
for ourselves we give our best
sacrifices to
God and so ultimately it leads to take
up your cross
daily and follow him I wish you the best
um and know that we here we will always
be here for you and uh lean on God it's
the best thing you could ever do let's
stand and
sing
our next song will be there's a fountain
free
