It's days like today, I I really miss
Rex.
And in 53 minutes time, so will you.
Joking.
Uh, morning church.
One day, a minister, he's delivering a
sermon about the importance of forgiving
your enemies.
And when he's a third of the way
through, he says to the church, he says,
"Raise your hands if you are now willing
to forgive your enemies."
And half of the people in the church
raise their hands. So the minister
continues to the sermon. And when he is
twothirds of the way through the sermon,
he says, "Raise your hands if you are
now willing to forgive your enemies."
Threearters of the church raise their
hands. And so the minister continues.
When he has completely finished his
sermon, he says, "Raise your hand if you
are now willing to forgive your
enemies." And everyone raises their hand
except for a little old old lady in the
front.
And the minister says to the lady, "Why
are you still unwilling to forgive your
enemies?"
"Simple," the old lady replies, "I have
no enemies."
"How old are you?" She says 96
and you have no enemies,
none at all.
The minister is amazed. He says, 'Come
up to the front with me.
So the minister and the old lady go up
to the front of the church. And the
minister says, "Please explain to the
entire congregation how it is possible
that you have no enemies."
And the lady says, "Simple. I outlived
them all.
The lesson today, church, is a hard
lesson. It's a lesson I struggle with.
Um, I'm not here to tickle your ears.
I'm not here to uh make you feel
comfortable and and I'm here to
challenge you. And I'm here to challenge
myself. And we should be seeking the
truth. We should be wanting to know the
truth. And uh unfortunately the truth
can be hard. It can be offensive.
But we need to embrace it.
So the first inconvenient truth,
we have a heart problem.
Jeremiah 7:19, the heart is deceitful
above all things and desperately sick.
Who can understand it? We have a heart
problem. And I'm going to show you this.
It says, "You have heard that it was
said,
you shall love your neighbor and hate
your enemy." Draw your attention to that
first piece. You have heard that it was
said. You have heard that it was said.
You have heard that it was said. Verse
21, verse 27, verse 33, verse 38, verse
43. Jesus is saying, "You have heard
that it was said
and he addresses anger or do not murder
uh do not uh do not commit adultery."
All right? He talks about do not take
oaths.
And then he says, "But I say to you that
even if you hate your brother, there's
judgment." Right? Even if you look at
someone with lust in your heart, it's
the same thing.
And so Jesus is addressing this issue.
You have heard that it was said, "Hey
guys, I I know what you're up to. I know
how you're twisting the scriptures."
In Matthew 23, Jesus talks to the
Pharisees. He says, "You are like
whitewashed tombs.
You are nice on the outside. You You
look wonderful, but on the inside,
you're dead man's bones. You hypocrites.
Woe to you.
Jesus is referencing Leviticus chapter
19. Well, one of them he's referencing
is Leviticus chapter 19:16 through to
18. And so I went and I read this and it
says, "You shall not go around as a
slanderer among your people, and you
shall not stand up against the life of
your neighbor. I am the Lord. You shall
not hate your brother." It's there uh in
your heart. They they conveniently uh
ignored that. But you shall reason
frankly with your neighbor, lest you
incur sin because of him. You shall not
take vengeance or bear a grudge against
the sins of your own people. But you
shall love your neighbor as yourself. I
am the Lord.
So I did a little bit more investigating
and you find in the Talmud, the Talmud's
a bunch of writings for the Jewish
people. And uh what they've done is
they've narrowed this down. This idea of
your neighbor to kind of suit
themselves, right? And I found a uh a
commentary out of the Talmet. It's one
of the mottos of the Pharisees, I guess.
If a Jew sees that a Gentile or Goyam
has fallen into the sea,
let him by no means lift him out.
Of course, it is written, "Do not rise
up against your neighbor's life." But
this man is not your neighbor.
Interesting.
You see how they've twisted scripture.
There's a group called the Essenes. Uh
their writings were found amongst the
Dead Sea Scrolls.
And what it shows is they excluded
basically everyone else. It was all
about their tribe, about their group.
That was their neighbor.
So it's very convenient to love your
neighbor, right? Um, notice how they
left out as yourself.
There's no command in the Bible to love
yourself, right? We We just do that by
default. We all know how to love
ourselves, right? You all dress nicely
today. We know how to love ourselves. We
We do that just permanently.
We're respecting of our needs. We're
respecting of our own wants. We're
respecting of our own ideas, our uh our
comforts, our welfare.
our the love for ourselves knows no
limits, right?
Have you ever noticed how quickly we are
to forgive ourselves?
We're supposed to love our neighbor that
way. That is a hard truth. That is a
very inconvenient truth for most of us.
And so we slowly start to twist the
scripture. So Jesus is saying, "You have
heard that it was said."
In the same chapter, Jesus talks about
coming to fulfill the law.
And he's pointing out where they've gone
wrong.
So who is your neighbor? Luke 10:2. I'm
going to read uh portion of the
scripture here. And it says, "And
behold, a lawyer stood up to put him to
the test, saying, "Teacher, what shall I
do to inherit eternal life? And he said
to him, "What is writ what is written in
the law?
How do you read it?" And he answered,
"You shall love the Lord your God with
all your heart and with all your soul
and with all your strength and with all
your mind and your neighbor as
yourself." And he said to him, "You have
answered correctly. Do this and you will
live." But he, desiring to justify
himself, said to Jesus, "And who is my
neighbor?" Hm.
Jesus replied, "A man was going down
from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell
among the robbers who stripped him and
beat him and departed, leaving him half
dead. Now by chance, a priest was going
down the road. And when he saw him, he
passed uh by the other side.
So likewise, a Levite when he came to
the place and saw him passed by the
other on the other side.
but a Samaritan
as he journeyed came to where he was and
when he saw him he had compassion. He
went to him and bound up his wounds
pouring uh on oil and wine and then he
sent him on his own animal and brought
him to an inn and took care of him. And
the next day he took out two daenery and
gave them to the inkeeper saying, "Take
care of him, and whatever more you
spend, I will repay you when I come
back."
Which of these three do you think prove
to be a neighbor to the man who fell
among the robbers? He said, "The one who
showed him mercy." And Jesus said to
him, "You go and do likewise."
That's your neighbor.
And essentially because the Jews would
pass by because they would see a man
like that in his situation because of
sin. But the one the Samaritan who's his
social enemy is the one who helped him.
I find when we take God's variety of
laws, we fail. We know that. And then we
condense it down to 10 and then we fail.
And then we condense it down to the two.
Love the Lord your God with all your
mind, soul, strength
and love your neighbor as yourself. And
we fail at that.
So we find ourselves in this divine
under divine punishment.
Also in Leviticus chapter 19:34 and
Exodus 12:49, it talks about there shall
be one law for the native and for the
stranger who so joins among you. They
knew they were supposed to treat each
other as neighbors, but they twisted it.
We twist the scriptures, too, church.
Don't think we don't.
We We're so quick to point at other
congregations and and other groups, but
we are just as guilty.
We twist the scriptures for our own
desires, for our own comforts. Yes.
Yeah. Make us feel a little bit better.
But Jesus is not calling us to be
comfortable here. Nothing about this
text is comfortable to me. I'm sorry.
Loving my my enemies. That's coming.
In fact, what I find in chapter 5, it's
kind of the opposite.
Our flesh wants to do one thing and
Jesus is saying, "No, no, no. Blessed
are the meek, the poor in spirit, the
mourers, the merciful, because they will
inherit, they will get.
It's kind of
different to the flesh, right?
By grace, my sins are covered.
That that does not extend a license to
manipulate, twist, and lie about God's
word.
Not our will, but his will. Amen.
We have an obedience problem, church.
This one's hard for me.
But I say to you, love your enemies.
The word there, love, is the Greek word
is agapate, which is from the root word
of agape. Agape is the highest form of
love described in the New Testament. It
is selfless, unconditional, and based on
the will rather than feelings. Based on
the will rather than feelings.
Unlike other kinds of love, it does not
depend on the worthiness or response of
the other person. Instead, it seeks the
well-being of others, even enemies.
Agape transcends the natural bonds and
is commanded to be shown to all people,
family, friends, and strangers alike.
The the word agapate,
it's a little different.
It's a verb,
something we do.
But what scares me the most, it is
imperative. It is a command. That's the
key difference. Agape describes God's
love. Agapate
is a command.
We are commanded to love our enemies.
You will love your enemies.
So, last year I had the opportunity to
sit down with a man um that I had prayed
for for a long time. uh had a one-on-one
lunch with him and got to ask some hard
questions. He was the one of the top
intelligence advisers to Obama and to
Trump
and unfortunately he confirmed some of
the things I've been talking about. But
this is this is something I just
this is where I see the world sometimes.
This is I feel like there's a nefarious
criminal cartel embedded deep within our
society driven to usher in the
Antichrist.
It's determined to establish falsehoods
as truth to deceive and rule over the
entire population. We'll be like lambs
to the slaughter. I believe there
sinister people who continue to mock us
and flaunt the horrific
ritualistic
and I'm talking horrific things.
Bloodrinking, flesh eating, human
sacrificing right under our noses.
I know that sounds crazy what I'm
saying, but our lack of understanding of
the occult blinds us to this filth.
While we continually chase the little
green piece of paper and uh the latest
trends and entertainment,
men and women and children are being sex
trafficked, tortured, and killed for
sport.
And I hate every part of it. I want
nothing to do with it. They worship
Mollik. They worship Bal. They worship
Baffomet and their symbology is all
around us. The synagogue of Satan is my
enemy. And if this shocks you, you need
to read your Bible more. This is in the
Bible. There is nothing new under the
sun.
And when I pressed this man for how do
we solve this? You know what his
response was? This is one of the top
advisers in the in the government.
His response was we need the churches.
We need the churches.
We have watched churches being forced
closed while strip clubs were deemed a
necessity. We have seen people arrested
for praying outside abortion clinics
while governments turn a blind eye to
harden criminals. We have seen the
destruction of cities costing us
taxpayers billions of dollars and not an
ounce of accountability. Right? They
successfully pit us against one another
using our differences keeping us
distracted and angry. And we fall for it
ashamedly proving that we are not deeply
rooted in God.
We have people in government and
government officials who pander to child
rapists and uh while arresting children
for trying to protect themselves under
the disguise of racism or
society champions those whose cultlike
beliefs prefer Christians to be beheaded
all in the name of tolerance.
It appears that evil is now good and
good is evil.
And Pilate says, "Who shall I release,
Jesus or Barabbus?" And the crowd
shouted, "Barabus."
Here's the very inconvenient truth,
church. What I just listed, those people
that are doing this, our enemies, we are
commanded to love them.
All kinds of these people, we are
commanded to love them. This is not a
suggestion. This is not an option. It's
not up for consideration.
We have to love them.
I was going through an article. This is
out of the de Democratic Republic of
Congo.
Uh these people, I'll just read the part
of the article. They had come to pay
tribute to one of their church members
who had recently passed away. At 9:00
p.m. on Monday, September 8th, just last
month, uh beginning of this month,
sorry. Christians in Notoya village
gathered at the funeral service in
eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
But what was supposed to be a peaceful
gathering of believers mourning together
ended in bloodshed
as attacks uh as militants attacked with
guns, mostly with machetes. By the time
the militants left, 70 Christians were
dead, 100 kidnapped, and 16 houses were
burned to the ground.
There are many many many more articles
like this and videos and all sorts of
stuff that is coming out that
I look at this and I say that's our
enemy to do that to Christians.
We are commanded to love them.
Think of the worst behaviors in
humanity. You know when we talk about
this with the youth they always say
Hitler we're commanded to love these
people.
So does that love mean we have to
tolerate their behavior? No, by no
means. Let me answer it this way. Jesus
escaped death multiple multiple times.
Do you think they were trying to kill
him because he was approving of their
behavior?
No. Hypocrites, brut of vipers, get
behind me, Satan. Jesus was speaking the
truth. We're called to speak the truth.
He loved them enough to tell them the
truth. We need to love them enough to
tell them the truth. And if I'm scared
of getting hurt, I will water down the
truth. We need to fix our heart problem
so we won't live in fear.
This is not a feeling. This is a
maneuvering of the will.
Church, I tell you, if the h if my house
is on fire, if my house is on fire and
I'm sleeping, do me the favor and do not
tolerate my attitude and my willingness
to sleep in.
Come in and get me. Wake me up. Even if
I'm angry with you,
at least try to get me out of bed. Hey,
Keegan, this is the way. This is the
door. This is the way to life. Come on,
let's go.
the price for loving others and telling
them the truth should be your life
because if it's not then there's a price
and we are able to be bought and we give
our lives to Christ.
If I look at the example of David when
addressing King Saul, his enemy in
chapter 24 of 1 Samuel, uh David who
could have killed Saul, he cuts off his
garment.
He could have killed his enemy. He
didn't. And then he spoke to him and he
was respectful. He was kind. But he lays
out the truth with no shame.
But whoa, Keegan, didn't God command
Saul to eradicate the evil enemy, the
Amalikites?
Yes. But there were holy wars that were
ordered and commanded by God. And until
God himself
calls you to do that, you are called to
love your enemy.
Proverbs 24:17, "Do not gloat when your
enemy falls. When they stumble, do not
let your heart rejoice. Love your
enemies means act with kindness,
compassion, and a desire for their
well-being, their soul,
even when they wish you harm." Second
Peter 3, God is not wanting any to
perish but for all to come to
repentance.
Third point, we have a laziness problem,
church.
And pray for those who persecute you.
It's written in Hebrews that we when we
pray, we have this access to the throne
of God. We boldly go before the throne
of God. We have this intercession.
We have a prayer list because we take
people to God. We take those people and
we pray and we say, "God, please help
them."
When my mother-in-law got sick with
cancer,
I didn't hate her.
I didn't like the cancer. So, I pray for
her. The same goes for our enemies. I
pray for my enemy enemies because they
are infected with evil.
They're sick and they need help.
God loves them.
He's not wanting any of them to perish
but come to repentance. Even the ones
who want to kill us.
Just like Paul, remember Paul when
persecuting Christians,
he was killing Christians.
And what an impact Paul had when he
converted. He had a sickness.
So just like we were once enemies of
God, shouldn't we extend that same
courtesy to them and pray for them and
love them?
They need our prayers. So when you see
something horrific,
evil in life or online, if somebody
offends you or angers you or scares you,
pray.
Pray for the softening of their hearts
that they come to know God.
They are consumed with evil. Don't match
wickedness with wickedness. The Bible
says we forget how blessed we are. We
get on our soapbox and we point at these
people and we we say all sorts of things
about them, but we are commanded to love
them and to pray for them.
And here's the beauty of praying for
your enemies. And I thought this is kind
of cool.
We find ourselves in alignment with one
another.
No matter what position you might hold,
if you if you think Republicans are the
enemy, pray for them. If you think
Democrats are the enemy, pray for them.
Right? If you feel anger towards the
recent assassination,
pray.
If you disagreed with a guy who was
assassinated, pray for him.
If you feel uh you know if you're
angered by the a man who violently
murdered a young lady on a train, pray
for him.
God doesn't want anyone to perish.
If you think Ukraine are the enemies,
pray for them. If you think uh Russia is
the enemy, pray for them. If you think
Israel or Palestine are the enemies,
pray for them. So if we disagree on
something, guess what? We're both
praying for that person or that that
group.
Isn't that kind of cool that we are
uniquely aligned with God in that
respect?
Maybe if we stop being lazy and
comfortable and start aligning ourselves
more closely with God and pray more,
maybe our conversations and our lives
will be filled with more light. We're
called to be salt and light. Jesus says
this in chapter 5 as well. Salt and
light.
So church, here's a challenge. 30 days.
30 days. Just 30 days. I challenge you
to pray for your your enemies. Pray for
a person or a group that your flesh
doesn't want to pray for.
Your will, pray for them.
Last point,
we have a rebellion problem.
So that you may be sons of your father
who is in heaven.
Do you not want to be a son or a
daughter to the the great king,
the almighty God?
God's will
is for us to love these people, to love
our enemies,
but we struggle with that, which makes
us disobedient to him.
Have you ever noticed that God's word,
the Bible, is filled with warnings?
Filled with warnings. Hey, come to
repentance.
This is the mess we're in. Come to
repentance. How God loves us so much.
How he loves his enemies
enough to forgive them.
Why don't we want to be in alignment
with that? Why do we struggle with this?
In Romans chapter 5, it says, "For while
we while we were still enemies, right?
We were reconciled to God by the death
of his son."
1 Peter 1, we are called to be holy. We
are called to be different, church.
This teaching is different. Loving your
enemies and praying for them.
So that equals being sons of the father,
it's like an equation, right?
This is a hard teaching.
This is different. In John 18:36, Jesus
answered, "My kingdom is not of this
world. If my kingdom were of this world,
my servants would have been fighting
that I might not be delivered over to
the Jews. But my kingdom is not of this
world
so that you may be sons of your father
who is in heaven."
God sent his son
to come down
to do this.
Do you not want to be a son?
And Jesus taught us how to love. Jesus
showed us our error. Jesus showed us how
we were twisting the scriptures, how we
have a hard problem. Jesus showed us how
you need to love. You need to pray.
And then he went to the cross.
and I need to be prepared to do the
same. If if I'm in alignment with God,
the price is my life. And so, at some
point, we need to climb on our cross and
maybe echo the words of the ones the one
who loves us. Father, forgive them
for they don't know what they're doing.
Church, this is a hard teaching. I know
I struggle with this myself. But maybe
if we pray more, maybe we can change
this with this world.
Maybe it'll be a little bit better.
Maybe our conversation will be more
about Christ and about and the word
instead of about what's happening out
there.
We need to pray, pray, pray. So in
closing, let's pray with me.
Our dearest God, our heavenly father,
Lord, we humbly come before you.
Father, forgive us. Uh we we fall short
of you so often, Father. We want to be
in alignment with you, Father, but we
struggle. Forgive us. Help us,
Father. We want to thank you for saving
us while we were still enemies to you.
We want to thank you for being patient
with us even when our hearts deceive.
Thank you, Father, for forgiving us.
Thank you for sending your son.
Father, help our hearts to be more
aligned with yours. Continue to soften
our hearts as you dwell within us.
Help us in our constant rebellion and
our disobedience. Father, mold us and
shape us as you would have us be.
Father, help us to let go and fully
trust you. Help us to pray more. Father,
even more so, help us to pray for our
enemies. Help us to be more proactive in
wanting all to come to know you.
Father, I pray for those in our
government that their hearts will be
softened, that they come to know you,
that they will have a relationship with
you and will carry out your will to
better this nation, to better the world.
Father,
Father, even though it feels like some
are against us, we pray for their souls.
Help us to see them as your creation as
well.
Father, I pray for those in our in our
media who continually constantly stir
the people up knowingly. I pray for them
to realize that you are God and that
love must prevail. Father, save them
just like you saved us.
Father, I pray for those who are killing
Christians, who are killing children,
who are doing horrific things in this
world. It's hard to love them, Father.
Um, it's hard to pray for them,
but please help them to change and to
stop what they're doing.
Help them to come to know you, Father.
Father, please stop these wars.
I pray for those who are wanting this
death and destruction. I pray that you
soften their hearts, Father. I I I pray
that you change their heart
for you and for creation, not for
destruction and control. Father, I pray
for the men who now face death row for
heinous acts. Father, their souls
matter, too. Um,
and Father, this may be controversial,
but our enemy Satan, I pray that his
heart is softened, that he comes to
repentance and falls on his knees to
find you and to to beg for forgiveness,
Father. Father, for all those who are
caught up in this evil, we pray for
comfort and peace until we meet you
again. Help us now, Father. We cry out
to you. You know the suffering that we
face, and we desperately need you. We
love you so much. In Jesus' name we
pray. Amen. Let's stand and sing.
Good morning. Good morning, family.
It's going to be hard for me to say
this.
Yeah,
I had to write this down because I'm not
able
to say this uh on my own,
but I've written a letter to you, my
beloved Creek Side family.
After much prayer, reflection,
I must share a decision that weighs
heavily upon my heart.
I will be stepping down from my role as
an elder
and a shepherd of this congregation. A
role that I've been honored to serve in
for the past 10 years.
This decision comes as my wife Billy
faces the challenge
of Alzheimer's.
In this season of my life,
my calling is to fully
be present with her
and to walk beside her with tenderness
and strength.
We will be relocating to Maryland
on October 4th
where our daughter Charity has
graciously offered her support and care.
Serving this church has been one of the
greatest privileges of my life.
You have been more than fellow
believers.
You've been my family.
Together, we've prayed, we've wept,
we've rejoiced,
and we've grown in the grace and
knowledge of our Lord.
I've witnessed your faithfulness,
your compassion,
and your unwavering commitment to
Christ.
I leave my position,
but not my love for you.
Though this is a difficult transition,
I trust in the Lord's provision for
Creekide.
He will remain faithful to uphold unity,
lead you in truth,
and raise up leaders and teachers just
as he's done through the ordination of
the recently ordained elders.
I ask for your prayers as Billy and I
began this new chapter in our lives.
And I promise to carry each of you
deeply within my heart.
May the peace of Christ dwell richly
among you.
Remain steadfast.
Continue to be that beacon of light that
shines so brightly in the community.
Love one another deeply
and keep your eyes fixed on Jesus.
With much love and gratitude,
me, Brother New Hansen.
Now,
I apologize for not sharing this sooner.
I knew this was coming.
My hope was to keep the spotlight
on our new elders and their ordination
rather than on me and Billy and our
transition.
As things stand,
we do expect to be at Bible class this
coming Wednesday.
That's going to be my last Bible class
at Creekide.
I'm teaching and I'm going to teach that
class.
But know this,
I love you each and every one of you.
You mean so so much to me.
This is not goodbye. It's just I'll see
you later.
I'm leaving my two boys here.
I'll be will be coming back to see them
and to see you.
I love you, Creekide. God bless and keep
you.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Yeah.
You learn a lot about a man when he
served beside him under stressful
conditions for 10 years.
During his time as an elder, I've seen
Lou as a compassionate, loving heart.
But don't assume he's weak or soft.
He's a fir he is firm and demanding when
it's necessary.
He has a deep knowledge and
understanding of the Bible and how to
apply it to life and to teaching.
He's been committed to watching over
this congregation, ensuring we stay
faithful to scripture and that the
members are taken care of.
He hasn't been swayed by outside
pressure, by culture, or by worldly
events.
But he has always been consistent, fair,
and helpful.
He's endured much heartache
with the untimely loss of a grandson and
struggled with health issues, but he has
never fa faltered or failed.
Thank you, Lou, for being a faithful
shepherd both for the Bell Scholes and
the Creek Side congregations. And may
God bless you and Billy as you start
another chapter in your life. As
Jonathan said to David, "You will be
missed."
We have a crystal
which has both the lighthouse emblem of
Belsholes and the logo for Creekide to
present to you to remember us by.
