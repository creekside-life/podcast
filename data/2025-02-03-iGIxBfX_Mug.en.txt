stewardship is
priorities that's what it really is a
steward has to have his priorities
straight and not sticking to your
priorities is deadly in a week where two
aircraft or three aircraft actually have
gone
down and people are mourning over that I
read a story of Michael Hillis Michael
Hillis was a sound enough pilot he
worked for the Cincinnati base Comm a
but because they thought at 29 years old
he seemed to tense up when he didn't
need to and they released him but it
wasn't a problem because he well
qualified pilot and he quickly found a
job at American
Eagle and he was at the controls on
flight
3379 and it descended toward the airport
in Raleigh North Carolina
exactly 30 seconds after 6:33
p.m. 2 minutes and four miles from the
airport the panel light on his cockpit
lit up and that panelite caught his
attention and the attention of his
co-pilot Matthew sailor and they
recognized the light as indicating that
the one of the engines had
quit so quickly they set about to
determine which engine had
quit in so doing however they forgot
about flying the
airplane at400 ft the jet stream 32
began to drop
fast
Hills and
sailor reacted immediately
but it was too late the plane smashed
into the
woods and 15 of the 20 people on board
died including Hillis and
sailor the investigations plowed through
all the
debris and when they got through doing
all their studies they concluded neither
of the plane's engines had failed at all
most likely the light had failed and it
was faulty
keeping the main thing the main thing is
what we're to do not doing that can be
deadly stewardship is priorities and not
sticking to your priorities is damaging
some of you are old enough others are
not to remember Paul
Harvey remember Paul Harvey wrote a book
called signs of the times back in August
1987
he told of someone that I used to read
the books of his name was uh Pastor
Robert Schuler a Garden Grove California
used to do Hour of Power some of you may
be old enough to remember that well he
had written a recent book and he was
visiting 14 cities Across the Nation to
promote his books which most of his
books very successful made a lot of
money his office had advised Robert
Schuler that when he got home he was
scheduled for a luncheon
uh the luncheon was with the wi of a
charity raffle at his church the raffle
ticket had been auctioned off at his
church for quote lunch with Robert
Schuler which is a very large Church of
thousands at that time so he hurried
home prepared to try to squeeze in this
luncheon into what was already a very
overcrowded schedule he learned that one
person had bid 500 $100 in the raffle
just for an opportunity to have lunch
with him toward the raising of whatever
they were raising that money for Schuler
was suddenly sobered when he happened to
find out that the
$500 represented the individual's entire
savings and then he found out the girl
willing to bid her entire savings to
have lunch with him was his own
schoolage daughter
who couldn't find
time to have lunch with his own School
AG
daughter not keeping the priority
straight can be
damaging stewardship is process of
trying to figure out what is your
priorities and not sticking to your
priorities can be very divisive
particularly to a family some of you may
remember Jimmy Johnson he's still
popular what you might not know about
Jimmy Johnson is not very
complimentary he divorced his wife for
26 years in 1990 Linda K Cooper that was
back in 1990 some of us don't forget
these things he did it because he was
going to become the head coach of the
Dallas Cowboys and quote he needed to
focus on football and didn't have time
for
marriage a wife was less important than
in pro football than being a coach in
college football in college football he
felt he needed a wife on the level of
college football for all the college
social functions and to show all the
families that he would look after their
son since he was a family man in pro
football though however he thought a
wife was
unnecessary as an accoutrement and a
distraction ction to
winning he said winning football was his
number one priority and his two
sons of course he went on to get another
woman Johnson is now a member of the Pro
Football Hall of
Fame if you respect
it stewardship is
priority and sticking to your priorities
can be a very big blessing to all
concerned if you do that and if I do
that you might remember another fellow
who coached for the Dallas Cowboys his
name was Tom
Landry he said this instead of being
like Jimmy Johnson which I know this is
going out over the airwaves and I
couldn't care
less but Tom Landry said the thrill of
knowing Jesus is the greatest thing that
ever happened to me I think God has put
me in a very special place and he
expects me to use it to his glory in
everything I do whether coaching
football or talking to the Press I'm
always a Christian Christ is first
family is second and football is
third that's a different view isn't it
our text I think reveals that we need to
pay attention to the order of things
what's first what's your priority and we
want to look at five ways that God gives
us an understanding of how he needs to
be
first number one stewardship is
priorities and they're connected to
giving God the first
born what does that have to do with us
today Genesis 4 and verse4 it says Abel
setting the standard for us all from the
very beginning to the very end this is
the
standard God wouldn't have recorded it
if it
wasn't Abel also brought of the
firstborn of his flock and of their fat
that means there were not just one but
more than one they're fat and the Lord
respected Abel in his offering now I
need to teach something here that goes
against what I've heard taught and what
I was taught the firstborn are given not
the second born
you need to hear that not the second
born or those
thereafter it wasn't essential that you
always give the that and the firstborn
are given not the you the
mother or the ram the
Father the reason I point that out and
you need to hear this because some of
you are convinced you got to give way
more than some of us are convinced you
have to give Deuteronomy 4 4 in verse
two teaches a very important lesson
don't add to what I
say and don't diminish what I
say in Matthew 23:4 it's very clear that
you we are not especially me to bind
heavy burdens and Grievous to be born
upon the people I speak to that is not
my
responsibility in fact verse 23 goes on
to make sure that yeah giving a tenth is
important but you can forget what really
matters and still be giving the
T So giving is to be done in a way that
honors God but that does not destroy
people
financially there are preachers running
around this country flying in
Jets and their people have been
destroyed by it
we're not going to go down that
path not long as I'm here that's why you
don't hear me talk a lot about this
subject because most of what I hear
preach on this subject isn't as biblical
as the people who preach it think it
is number
two stewardship is priorities connected
to giving God the first fruits firstborn
absolutely every one of
them not necessarily it was of the
firstborn
oh and first
fruits it says in Proverbs 3 and: 9
honor the Lord with your possessions and
with the first fruits of all your
increase so many people have preached
for so long they have preached it so
hard on this
subject and it's your increase that
you're to
give your first fruits of pay
attention don't make it harder than it
is don't make it easier than it is I'm
just as responsible if I make it easier
as I am as I make it harder Deuteronomy
4 verse two do not add to and do not
take away from so the first fruits are
given not the first fruits that produce
year
round the first fruits of the Harvest of
the
increase think about it the first fruits
are given not the tree you don't cut the
tree down and give some of the wood and
it's not sold for firewood and given
there are things in your life that are
assets that you're not to take a tenth
of and give it to the
Lord think through what you're doing and
don't destroy yourself financially
because giving is to be done in a way
that hon honors God first are you
following this is first this is your
first priority your firstborn your first
fruits it should honor God but that
doesn't mean that you're to do it to the
point of it destroys you financially and
you ignore your bills you pay your bills
you pay them on time and you say well I
can't make my gift then you have
mismanaged your debts and you need to
get out of debt where you can pay God
the way you should as
well amen
walls amen
walls stewardship is priorities number
three it's priorities connected to
giving God the first
love Revelation 2 and verse4
nevertheless I have this against you
that you have left your first love
what's your first
love your wife your husband it shouldn't
be
the first love is given not to men not
to my
neighbor Matthew 22 37-39 the first
thing I am to love is the Lord Our God
that's the first
commandment and then of course my
neighbor after that Ephesians
1:15 I'm to love the Saints but not more
than I love the Lord I love you Brethren
but if I had to I'd turn my back on you
and you you should turn your back on me
amen the first love is given to the
father not to my father not to my mother
not to my son not to my daughter I love
all them we should all love them right
Matthew 10:37 though if you love them
more than you love him you have got it
out of
order you have to check yourself because
you could easily do it mamas
not more than me not more than me not
more than
me so giving is to be done in a way that
honors God but that does not destroy
your life because if you get this out of
order it will destroy your family you
think it's safe I love my little one I
love him and it's the most important
thing in my life and you think that's
safe that's deadly
it will destroy your family if your
child matters more than your
husband I've seen it
happen I'm not making it up it will
destroy your family if you love your
family more than you love God I'm not
trying to be tough on you I'm trying to
save
you this is important this is not kind
of important this is the thing this is
called priorities and it's what's being
a good
Steward number
four stewardship is priorities and is
connected to giving God the first
Works Revelation 2 verse 5 remember
therefore from which you have fallen
repent and do the first works or else I
will come to you quickly and remove your
lamp stand from its place unless you
repent listen to me your first works are
not here believe repent confess and be
baptized I mean that's obviously not the
first words otherwise every time we sin
we got to go back and hear believe
repent confess and be baptized that's
not what he's talking about what's your
first Works what's your first works the
priorities that God gave us when we
first begin to follow him what are they
the first works are given as works of
reconciliation with men Matthew 5 and
verse 24 first be reconciled to your
brother if you're wandering away from
the Lord I guarantee you're probably out
of step with your
brothers your first works are as works
of righteousness in the Kingdom Matthew
6:33 seek first the kingdom of God and
his righteousness and all these things
will be added to you that's your first
works it's the first things you're
supposed to do the first works are given
as works of realization of our sins in
Matthew Chapter 5 7 and verse 5
you looking around at everybody else
maybe this morning thinking about this
sermon probably applies to brother so
and so get the beam out of your own eye
first then you'll be able to see clearly
that maybe your brother is doing
actually better than you
are quit thinking you're the one you're
the sharpest knife in the drawer we
don't need any more of you sharp knives
are you listening to me we got Brethren
who think they're the sharpest knife in
the drawer in our church and you need to
humble yourself and quit looking around
you want to do a first work be humble
get out on your knees that's a first
work and the first works are given as a
work of reformation of our heart Matthew
23:26 first cleanse the inside of the
cup quit worrying about how it looks out
here clean that thing inside that nasty
desire get that out you want to work on
something work on
that you addicted to something deal with
it okay those are your first
words do your first Works don't need to
be baptized
again you need to get these things
straight so when we talk about giving
giving is to be done it's to be done in
a way that honors God but that does not
destroy you if you start thinking your
giving will fix all this other stuff you
think you're buying a Stairway to Heaven
and that don't
happen get get the real things done
first number next actually it's the last
one it's the one we read a moment ago
stewardship is priorities connected to
giving God the first service read just a
little bit of it again verse 7 and which
of you having a servant plowing or
tending sheep now if you have you ever
plowed most of you haven't ever plowed
it's a nasty job
tend and sheep sheep have a lovely
odor I'd rather be around a hundred cows
any day as one
sheep servant plowing or tending sheep
so he smells both of them smell both of
them nasty well say to him when he has
come in from the fields you're as nasty
as you can be go bait
no come at once and sit down to eat
but will he not rather that's not what
he's going to do and listen this is your
master and you're
nasty and you stink from
work come rather and say to him prepare
something for my supper and gge yourself
and serve me till I have eaten and drunk
and afterwards you will eat and
drink does he thank that servant
because he did the things that were
commanded him he do know you a thank you
you're here this morning God does not
owe you a thank
you he's not up there going oh oh thank
you for coming up to My
Worship You owe
it you owe it and if you listen to the
story
you're
nasty and you
stink and listen to this one some of you
won't come if you're nasty and you stink
and I'll tell you who I respect is a man
who's working a blue collar job comes
straight from his work still got filth
all over him his hands still covered in
grease and he comes to
worship I respect that amen men walls
listen to me the first service which is
worship is
giving when you're dirty when you're
tired when you're hungry because there's
a spiritual parallel to that because
that's where we all are so we're nasty
when we come here you say well I'm not
like all those other people in church
yeah you are you're just as bad as the
rest of us
and the first service of worship is
given even when you're
overworked and unappreciated I don't
have time to go to church that's when
you got to
go you got to go then I'm too busy for
that that's when you must
go I'm overworked and I'm unappreciated
God isn't even showing me that's when
you must
go cuz if you don't go
then it don't mean me anything to
you giving is to be done in a way that
honors God but that does not destroy you
God has no desire to destroy your life
to ruin you to damage you he's trying to
save you so giving the firstborn of a
flock or the first fruits of a harvest
or the first love to God or the first
works of a saved Christian or the first
service to the master priority are what
makes a good Steward giving loving
working
serving Harry Foster
chapen born in 1942 died in 1981 he's 8

the drama of that song that Harry
chapen Sayang played out in his
life it was a self-fulfilling prophecy
his wife Sandy had been married before
and she wrote a poem about her
ex-husband not stepping in with the kids
and Harry's distant father not paying
attention to
Harry Harry created that poem into a
song based on that poem and a nursery
rhyme called hey didd
didd Sally his wife after she he wrote
this song and made it popular asked him
one day when he was going to slow down
his heated pace of life and give time to
their children and he answered at the
end of this busy summer I promise I'll
take some time to be with them that
summer Harry was killed in a tragic car
wreck it never
happened maybe you too have struggled
with your
priorities
stewardship is getting your priori
straight is your first priority God that
is giving loving working serving with
him is right after God your family
giving loving working serving them and
right after that your business that's
right that's
next because you got to feed them giving
loving working serving the people you
work with and then somewhere right after
that church giving loving working
serving them here's your chance to turn
it around we always offer an invitation
if you need to turn it around we're
always here some may need to give their
life completely to hear believe repent
confess and be baptized which is in one
of the first things you do here's the
deal Once Upon a
Time
Jesus put you
first above
all are you willing to put Jesus first
