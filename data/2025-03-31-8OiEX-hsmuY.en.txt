Please bow me in

father, we thank you for this morning
that we were blessed to see. We thank
you for opening our eyes this morning to
see the day that you have made. We thank
you for safe passes to this meeting
place that we may worship and edify you.
Lord, we ask that you be with those who
are still traveling, whether it be here
or to their destination, that you grant
them safe
passage, we ask that you be with those
who are sick and shut in because we know
you are the great physician and with
your healing hands all things are
possible, Lord. And for those who have
known loss, we ask that you wrap your
loving arms around them and that you
bless us that that we may be able to do
the same because we know that your
grace it abounds and that it is so
wonderful and that we are better
together than we are apart,
Lord. Lord, we ask that you you be with
us during these trying times because we
know that the devil deals in chaos, but
you deal in love and grace. We ask that
you bless us that we may have that love
and grace that we may be able to be the
lights in the world guiding others to
you and show them that there is a better
way, your way,
Lord. We know that we fall short, Lord.
And we thank you for your son whose
death on the cross gave us a chance
everlasting and eternal salvation with
you through repentance. Lord, we ask you
to forgive us of our sins in thought,
word, and deed. And these and all
blessings we ask in your precious name.
Amen.
Before the Lord's supper this morning,
we'll sing How Deep The Father's
Love. How deep the Father's love for
us. How ask beyond all
measure that he to give his holy
son to make the right hisure.

heart
my son.
Good morning
church. As we uh prepare our hearts and
our minds uh to partake of the Lord's
supper this morning, I have a few uh
thoughts that I'd like to like to share
with you. When Jesus instituted uh this
feast, he told us to do this in
remembrance of him. Uh Paul says in 1
Corinthians 11 that every time we do
this, we are proclaiming
uh the Lord's death. And so through this
uh feast using these emblems, a small
cracker, a small cup of grape juice, we
are
proclaiming that Jesus Christ came,
lived a perfect life, that he died on
the cross on our
behalf, and that he rose again.
I want to read from Colossians
1 and we'll read verses, if you have
your Bibles, we'll read verses 19 uh
through
23. And Paul writes, "For it pleased the
Father that in him all the fullness
should dwell, and by him to reconcile
all things to himself, by him, whether
things on earth or things in heaven,
having made peace through the blood of
his cross. And you who were once uh who
once were alienated and enemies in your
mind by wicked works, yet now he has
reconciled in the body of his flesh
through death to present you holy and
blameless and above reproach in his
sight. If indeed you continue in the
faith, grounded and steadfast, and are
not moved away from the hope of the
gospel which you heard. I saw something
on Instagram
uh this week that
uh really helped me. We we have a
tendency to put our hope in things of
this world. We have a tendency to trust
in things of this world. We have a
tendency to rely on things of this
world. And I think Jesus really
knew what he was doing when he
instituted uh this feast. And the post
uh that I read says uh Buddha and
Muhammad lived, died, and stayed dead.
Confucious and Gandhi lived, died, and
stayed dead. Earthly kings lived, died,
and stayed dead. Presidents lived died
and stayed dead. Celebrities have lived,
died, and stayed
dead. Jesus is the only one who has
lived, has died, and not stayed dead. He
rose
again up to the right hand of the
father. And every week we have a
reminder of what he's done for us. But
we also have a
reassurance that it's not on our behalf.
That it's nothing that we could have
done. It's nothing that we have done to
find hope and an eternal life with
Christ and with God. So, I hope that
uh take a second, clear your minds,
focus on what really matters, and let's
uh remember the sacrifice that our
savior had on our behalf. Let's
pray. Holy Father, we come to you now.
We just thank you so much for this great
day, Lord. We thank you for all of the
blessings that you have bestowed upon
us. And Father, we thank you for the
greatest blessing of all. We thank you
for the greatest example of all. And we
thank you for Jesus. We thank you for
the perfect life that he lived, the body
that he freely gave up to be beaten and
mocked and tormented on our behalf. And
and we are just so
grateful that we know we deserve to be
nailed to a cross. We know that we
deserve to be shamed and to be beaten.
And Father, we are just so grateful that
Jesus took that upon
himself and that he took away the
torment and the struggle that we
deserve. And father, we're just asking
that you help us and bless us to to
always remember that and then to take
that knowledge and that realization and
to go out into the world and to be
sacrificial servants to those around us
and that we can do all of these things
to bring glory to your name and to help
everyone else know your
son and what he did for us.
We thank you for his body. We ask that
you bless this bread as we partake of
it. In Christ's name we pray. Amen.
The Hebrew writer in chapter 9:es 22
says reminds us that uh according to the
law almost all things are purified with
blood and without shedding of blood
there is no remission. He goes on to say
in verse 28 that so Christ was offered
once to bear the sins of many to those
who eagerly wait for him. He will appear
a second time apart from sin for
salvation. Let's
pray. Holy Father, we come to you now
just asking you to bless this cup that
represents your son's blood. The the
blood that that had to be shed to wipe
away uh our sins, to wipe away the debt
uh that we owe. And and father, we are
just so grateful uh that you've uh
instituted us to do this on a weekly
basis to remind ourselves of what you've
done for us, to remind ourselves of what
Christ has done for us. And father now
we just uh want to thank you. Want to
express our love and our
gratitude to
you for being the greatest giver of
blessings, to be the greatest giver of
forgiveness, to be the greatest giver of
mercy and grace. And father, as we take
this cup, we just ask that you will help
us to clear our minds and clear our
hearts and to take this with a good
conscience and a conscience of
thankfulness and appreciation. It's in
Christ's name we pray. Amen.
morning. This portion of our service is
dedicated to your heart. what you have
in your heart, what you're able to do as
far as giving back to
God, God gave to us. And what we have,
we should give back a portion of it to
sustain the things that we have set
aside for other
people. also for the businesses of this
church and its
missions and the assistance it does give
to the
community. As stated before, they also
have here salaries to be paid because we
do have salary
people, we have
lights, we have utilities. All of that
has to be paid. that comes out of your
pocket through your generous
contributions. I mean just like we have
arms and legs and all all of that comes
together to make one body. Some can give
more, some
cannot. We can give according to God's
grace. God blesses all of us. Some
people they have different ministries.
Some
prophesy, some exhort
others. God also gave some the ability
to have a little bit more money than
others. So that means that they can give
a little bit more. But not everybody's
like that. Some people live from
paycheck to paycheck. But the bottom
line is give from your heart. Give as
God has prospered you. You are God's
instrument. We are God's instrument. We
give back according to his will. Let's
go to God in prayer. Kind and gracious
heavenly father. Father God, we praise,
honor, and glorify your holy name.
Thanking you once again for giving us
this wonderful opportunity to be here to
worship you in spirit and in truth. Oh
Lord, Father, we at this
time will give back a portion of debt
that you have given unto
us. Even though that exact amount was
not
specified, but Father, you are the God
who knows our hearts. And we pray that
you will consider us and all that we do.
We love you and we thank you for
continuously loving us. In Jesus's holy
name we pray. Amen.
for our scripture in our lesson. We'll
sing yet with my soul. If you would
stand with me while we sing the song
will be standing for the scripture.

Good morning
everyone. Today's scripture reading will
be from Acts chapter 14 verse
17. Yet he has not left himself without
testimony. He has shown kindness by
giving you rain from heaven and crops in
their seasons. He provides you with
plenty of food and fills your hearts
with joy. You may be seated.
You'll have to forgive the glasses. I
can't see anything up close
anymore. If you don't know who I am, my
name is Sean Andrews. I am one of the
deacons here. The ministry I've been
tasked with that I really was working
before that I was asked to be a deacon
was men's ministry. Uh that is a passion
of mine. I said once from the microphone
up here making announcement that men are
a passion of mine. And it didn't go over
super
well, but men's ministry is a passion of
mine. And it is because I'm desperate to
be God's man. And I think there are
other men in this place and around the
world who are desperate to be God's man.
And everything out there is calling us
down and not up. So, it's a ministry
that is important, I think, not just to
me, but to us. And so, it's one that we
try to help uh men be godly men and to
serve God in a way that's going to bring
him glory and bless all the rest of us.
Hopefully, you've got your Bibles. I
want to be in Acts chapter 14 for just a
few minutes. As a setup to what we've
got going
here, I want to tell you a story. And
this all has been in my mind since a
couple weeks ago we had this evangelism
workshop. Evangelism is our mission as a
church. That's the
deal. Jesus said that the son of man has
come to save that which is lost. If that
was his mission and we are his bride, we
are his body. Then if that's his
mission, that's our mission. Everything
else supports that. Everything
I'm not sure exactly what the year was.
I was talking to Lee about this this
last week and trying to remember exactly
when it was. I remember that uh we had
Garrett, we had Lauren. If we had
Lauren, that means it was at least 96,
maybe 1997, somewhere in there. I was
still active duty. I was stationed in uh
Eastern New
Mexico at this wonderful base called
Canon and Clovis. if you know where that
is. It is flat, brown, and windy. All of
the things that
Lee doesn't particularly care
for. And we were at the Clovis
Mall and she and I stopped. I had the
baby, I had Lauren, and we stopped at a
jewelry store and I don't remember
specifically what it's one of those
corner jewelry stores. I saw something.
Stepped in. She and I were talking and
in a moment I looked around and no
Garrett. I cannot describe for you the
panic because I looked around and no
Garrett, this two or maybe
three-year-old who does not that he knew
no
strangers and I was beyond
terrified. Let me tell you what I did
not do. I'll tell you what I did not do.
I didn't organize classes on how to find
lost
children. I didn't wait until somebody
else more qualified came
along. I didn't just do nothing because
I was afraid of doing the wrong
thing. I'll tell you what I did. I
immediately started searching from right
from right where I was standing. My
brain went into sweep mode. I drew a
circle around where I was, where I could
see, and I searched everywhere and
everyone looking for that
child and I started moving. I handed Lee
the baby and I started on a mission. I
was going to find that little boy and I
was going to find him fast. And I was
praying that God didn't have him in
somebody's hands cuz I didn't know what
I would do if I caught somebody trying
to steal him. But I went looking and I
covered a lot of ground and I covered it
in a short amount of time.
I opened that circle a little bit wider
and I searched that circle and I called
his name and I called it loudly. I
called it with attention, with
intention. I called it with no apology.
I called it with no embarrassment. I was
going to find him if it killed
me. I was calling him. I was searching
him as though his life depended on
it. Now, he's still around. So, we
obviously found him. Can I tell you
where he was? He was down in
Walmart at the
counter telling them that his parents
were
lost. That's a long time ago. And my
heart right now is beating like I can't
even tell you.
God entrusted to us this precious little
soul and he was
gone. What in the
world? We recently had this evangelism
workshop and I'm wondering if you one
were here and did you did you
hear that? That's our
mission. That there are precious souls
that are
lost. And we focus our attention on the
things that make us comfortable. And
I'll be really, really blunt with you. I
am not comfortable standing up in front
before this starts. I do not like being
called up in front of a crowd. I'm
comfortable doing this because this is
his, but I'm not comfortable in front of
a crowd. I don't like being pushed out
of my comfort zone. I like my space. I
like my zone. I don't like being pushed.
I assume a lot of you are that way. Is
that
fair? And it's comfortable and it's easy
to come here and have a time of worship,
go to Bible class maybe, and then go on
our way. Maybe come back because we were
having some sort of a function, but to
go out and teach people, well, that's
not really my thing. Somebody else will
do it.
If those souls lives depend on us
spreading the gospel, and Jesus said
they do, then what in the world are we
doing? We need a workshop to get us
moving. We need some special technique.
If we want to be successful at bringing
souls to Jesus, we need to simply look
for people who are separated from their
father. Open up our eyes and look around
for those who are separated from their
father. Call to them with the gospel of
Jesus with
intention, with no apology, with no
embarrassment as though their souls
depend on it. Am I wrong?
We know it to be
true, but we need a
workshop. We need a
technique. We need somebody to organize
it for us, teach us in a special class.
I shared with this shared this with the
men when we were at our men's retreat
years ago. I was working with uh young
people and talking about that's our
mission. And even if you're a young
person, if you're a child of God, that's
our mission. And if you're thinking, I
don't know how in the world I would go
about doing that. Are you ready for the
answer? Here it comes. Guys, you of you
that were up there, you've heard it
already. So, it's not going to be a
shock or a surprise. This is easy. Are
you a Christian? Yep. I'm a Christian.
Do you know why you're a Christian? Yes,
I know why I'm a Christian. Do you know
how you became a Christian? Yes, I know
how I became a Christian. Do you speak
English? Yes, you're qualified.
It's that simple.
It's that
simple. The only thing that really gets
in our way of going to the lost with the
gospel message is what? My own
embarrassment. When I thought Garrett
was lost, I didn't
care because I believed his life
depended on it. Are y'all hearing me
this
morning? Evangelism is not about
gimmicks. It is not about techniques.
It's not about just getting it packaged
just
right. There's a difference, I grant
you, between sewing seed and throwing
it. And we'd be wise to realize our job
is not to throw seed at people. I'm
going to choke you with Jesus. I don't
care what it that's. That's not
right. But thinking, I've got to get it
packaged just right. The power is in the
word.
I'll illustrate.
You ever hear the story of
Jonah? Jonah walked into
Nineveh. He was not happy to be there.
He was reluctant to go there from the
beginning. And when he walked into
Nineveh, what was his proclamation? What
was his
message? Let's sing this little song.
Jesus loves
me. Jonah walked into town and he said,
"Yet 40 days and Nineveh will be
overthrown."
If we put that in a little bit more
modern English, 40 days, this place is a
smoking
hole. Drop the mic. That's the
message. And
yet Nineveh
repented from the greatest to the least.
Sackcloth and ashes, they repented.
Evangelism quite simply, Romans 10:17,
it's about faith that comes by hearing
and hearing by the word of God. But
they're not going to hear it if we're
not speaking
it. Can I make it a little bit more
simple? Brother Rob, while he was here,
he kept going into his pocket saying, "I
just so happened I thought if somebody
did that to me, I'd turn around and walk
out." But he was trying to make a
point. We have the word with us all the
time. Can you hear that? All the time.
The word is with
me. And it's as simple as saying, "I
found this Bible
study. I don't want to do it by
myself. Would you do it with
me?" And if you're thinking, "Well, that
doesn't sound like you're going to teach
somebody. That sounds like you just want
to sit and study it together."
Aha. You know how I know that works?
That's what I
do. I have a job and I go to that job
and I talk to people about the things
that that job requires. But there are
moments when we build relationships and
I say, "You know what? I found this
Bible study and I don't want to do it by
myself. Would you do it with me?" Now, I
get nos. I get told no.
But I'm okay with
that because today's no might be
tomorrow's
yes. You just don't
know. This morning, if you're looking up
at the screen of what my lesson is, five
witnesses from God's general revelation
and our text, I want to talk for a few
moments with you about a different
answer that you might get than yes or
no. What if somebody says, "I don't
believe in God.
What if I don't believe in
God? Well, one, I think that's an
interesting response. I'll tell you why
I think that's an interesting response.
And first, all of you sitting here, if
somebody said, "I don't believe in God."
You're going to do one of two things
more than likely. The two typical
responses of most Christians today is
one, find a way to escape and escape
quickly because I don't know what to do
now. The other is you're going to pull
out every shred of evidence that you can
imagine and try to throw it at them
thinking that if if eventually you give
them enough evidence, they'll
believe. Am I
wrong? I think somebody saying, "I don't
believe in God." is quite an interesting
response. Have you ever wished somebody
a merry Christmas? Ever. back before it
was taboo to do it, which I got to tell
you, that's like pouring gas on a fire
with me. And had that person respond
with indignics,
uh, Santa is a myth. Santa is nothing
more than a creation from the
imagination of saps and old people with
nothing better to do than try to force
the rest of us into being more giving. I
cannot believe that anybody would
believe in Santa. And I don't believe in
Santa. That ever happened to you? It's
never happened to me.
Ever?
Ever? Ask yourself why
not. So why do fe people feel compelled
to tell us I don't believe in
God? I think that's a creation of
somebody's imagination of weak-minded
people. Why do they feel like they got
to say that?
Take a look at this scripture. Romans
chapter 1 18
to20. The Bible says that the wrath of
God is revealed from heaven against all
ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
who suppress the truth in
unrighteousness because what may be
known of God is manifest in them. For
God has shown it to them. For since the
creation of the world, his invisible
attributes are clearly seen, being
understood by the things that are made,
even his eternal power and godhead, so
that they are without
excuse. According to this
text, who needs proof that God
exists? No one.
Read it
again. Since the creation of the world,
his invisible attributes are clearly
seen, being understood by the things
that are made, even his eternal power
and godhead, so that they are without
excuse. Who needs proof that God exists?
Who? According to the Bible, no one.
They know. We all
know that knowledge may be suppressed.
He talks about that in 19. They suppress
the truth in unrighteousness. So that
knowledge may be suppressed but it is
not
missing. It may be denied but it is not
erased. By the way, you cannot suppress
something if it's not
there. So now that begs the question in
my mind, how much do they
know? I don't know. According to this
text, they know enough to be without
excuse. Even those who have never heard
of God explicitly of his moral law have
felt the weight of accountability
pressing on the thoughts and intents of
their
hearts. Scholars call this knowledge
God's general revelation.
In other words, what God has revealed of
himself generally to all
mankind. Our text this morning, that's
it. God did not leave himself without
witness. What's the context of this?
Paul and Barnabas are on a missionary
journey. They're in Lististra. They are
confused. The people have confused them
for Hermes and
Zeus. And why? Because they healed a
crippled man. And the people are
confusing them for Hermes and Zeus. And
if they're confusing them for that,
they're wanting to worship them. And
Paul and Barnabas say, "Stop
that." And they begin to talk about God,
the
God. God did not leave himself without
witness in that he did good. He gave us
rain from heaven and fruitful seasons.
He has filled our hearts with food and
gladness.
Now, general revelation is held in
contrast with special
revelation. That's special revelation
right there. What God has specially
revealed to his own special people. You
want a verse for that? Here's one.
Hebrews 1 1:3. God who at various times
and in various ways spoke in time past
to the fathers by the prophets has in
these last days spoken to us by his son
whom he has appointed heir of all things
through whom also he made the worlds who
being the brightness of his glory and
the express image of his person and
upholding all things by the word of his
power when he had by himself purged our
sins sat down at the right hand of the
majesty on
I special
revelation. In 2002, I had to go back
and look to make sure I had the year
right. In 2002, I was at a sermon
seminar in Austin. The school was Austin
Graduate School of Theology. And one of
the speakers was a guy who at the time
called himself uh he described himself
as being from the conservative wing of
the Episcopalian church, which I thought
was bizarre, but nonetheless, he is a
philosophy professor at UT Austin, a
prolific writer, and a really
interesting thinker. His name is Jay
Bujski. I know that's a mouthful. This
is what he said about the Christian mind
and its development. He said, "In
general, biblically minded Christians
are smart people. They're neither
stupid, backward, nor ignorant. But
there is something wrong with the way
the modern conservative Christian mind
has developed." Hear that part again,
that last part. There is something wrong
with the way the modern conservative
Christian mind has developed.
Now, he obviously had an entire speech.
In fact, there were a couple of them.
But what he was describing, what he was
speaking of was an intellectual flaw,
not an intellectual error. In other
words, there was a an sort of an
intellectual lopsidedness. Think about,
do you know what a fiddler crab is? You
seen pictures of a fiddler crab? They've
got one uh claw arm that's super super
developed like Arnold Schwarzenegger
developed and they got this other little
fiddly one. So, it's lopsided. Hence,
they have the name fiddler
crab. Well, like a fiddler crab, what he
was describing is that our minds have
generally been developed like that to
where speaking of God's general
revelation and his special revelation, I
probably should should have switched
those. We've got this overdeveloped
confidence in God's special revelation
scripture. That's what we know. So,
that's what we want to use. And that's
good. But we have an underdeveloped
appreciation and knowledge of God's
general revelation, which by the way,
God's made known to all men. It's like
divine sticky notes
everywhere. So, we are devoted to and
confident in God's special revelation,
but we're essentially ignorant of his
general revelation. That doesn't mean we
don't know it. It means we don't make
use of it. And by the way, ignorant does
not mean the same as stupid. Which is
why he characterized the problem as an
intellectual flaw and not an error. In
other words, it's not that we don't
believe God has revealed himself outside
the scriptures. Rather, we've not made
use of that
knowledge. And I'm not at all describing
either trying to prove the existence of
God. I think that's a mistake.
I'll give you another
example. Paul on Mars Hill. Now to
appreciate what the hill Mars Hill was,
the hill of the Aropagites. Sometimes
they called it the Aropagus. You had
philosophers of all different sorts who
gathered together to just try to find
and talk about some new
thing. Paul sized up his audience and he
appealed to something he knew they
already knew. To set the table, to
appeal to scripture. Acts chapter
17:22-31, "Men of Athens, I perceive
that in all things you are very
religious." Now, another translation is
going to have they're
superstitious. They're kind of
interesting words. Uh particularly when
you look at the original, they're
chasing after something they don't even
know what it is. For as I was passing
through and considering the objects of
your worship, I even found an altar with
this inscription, to the unknown God.
Therefore, the one whom you worship
without knowing, him I proclaim to
you. God who made the world and
everything in it, since he is Lord of
heaven and earth, does not dwell in
temples made with hands, nor is he
worshiped with men's hands as though he
needed anything since he gives to all
life, breath, and all things. And he has
made from one blood every nation of men
to dwell on all the face of the earth,
and has determined their pre-appointed
times and the boundaries of their
dwellings, so that they should seek the
Lord in the hope that they might grope
for him and find him, though he is not
very far from each one of
us. For in him we live and move and have
our being, as also some of your own
poets have said, for we also are his
offspring. Therefore, since we are the
offspring of God, we ought not to think
ought not to think that the divine
nature is like gold or silver or stone,
something shaped by art and man's
devising. Truly, these times of
ignorance God overlooked, but now
commands all men everywhere to repent,
because he has appointed a day on which
he will judge the world in righteousness
by that man whom he has ordained. And he
has given assurance of all this uh of
this to all by raising him from the
dead.
Now, that's a lot. But here is my
point. If we are going to be effective
soul winners, one, we need to get
serious about our belief that there are
lost souls and they need to hear the
gospel. That's first. But when we
encounter those people who say, "I don't
believe in God." Rather than running for
the hills or entertaining a pretense
that they actually don't believe in God,
we know that they actually
know that knowledge is being
suppressed. We ought to get smarter
about our approach. We ought to learn
how to appeal to what we know they
already know, God's general revelation,
instead of relying solely on what they
don't want to know, God's special
revelation.
It is important, it is important to
remember that the starting point of this
discussion said another way, my chief
underlying
presupposition is that we all know God
is not that there is a God. Please hear
that. That's not the argument. I don't
believe that Romans 1 is arguing that
people know there's a God. people know
God
is and that we are accountable to
him. So none of this is about proving
the existence of God. You've got to hear
that. How in the world could it get to a
point where people would suppress the
knowledge of tr knowledge of God? How
would they do that? I'll give you an
illustration. It's just an illustration.
And like any illustration, you stretch
it far enough, it's going to break
apart. So it's just an illustration. I
want you to think about a company. There
was a guy who decided that he had an
interesting uh good or service that he
wanted to market to the world and so he
formed he founded a company grew it from
nothing from an idea into a full company
that eventually went public. It's a big
company and he is not only the founder,
he is also the
CEO and at some point his board of
directors decided that they want to take
that company a different direction. And
because he's the founder and CEO and
he's determined to go the direction that
he's set because well, he's the founder
eventually they decided to retire him.
They paid him well, but they retire the
founding CEO. And then they find a new
CEO to help take them in a new
direction. Now, of course, you can
imagine that the employees of that
company were resistant at first. They
didn't like the fact that the that the
old CEO had been ousted. They didn't
like that we're going in a new
direction. Most of us don't like change.
And yet, the board and the new CEO are
determined. And they woo the employees
essentially with bonuses and perks. more
benefits, more pay, fine, I'll put up
with it. And people went
along. Over time, the board and the new
CEO challenged the effectiveness of the
company's processes and update them.
We're moving
away. And the challenge of the overall
mission of the company uh is the thing
that comes next. And they begin to set
up focus groups to define a better
mission and to ensure that the company's
core values are updated to fit the new
mission. You see what's going on?
They're moving the company entirely away
from what it was founded to be. and to
do. And eventually they the board and
the new CEO, they speak and act as
though the founding CEO never even
existed. And they get angry with
employees who want to hearken back to
the old
days. You see how this could
happen? But God did not leave himself
without witness.
God did not leave himself without
witness. So this morning, five witnesses
from God's general revelation. If you're
thinking, "Well, wow, if that was the
intro, we're going to be here a while."
Nope. These will be
fast. Number
one,
conscience. Conscience. We really laid
the foundation for this witness already,
and that's why I tried to do it the way
I did it. The foundation's laid. We can
talk about these in brief. The wrath of
God is revealed from heaven against all
ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
who suppress the truth in
unrighteousness. Because what may be
known of God is manifest in them. For
God has shown it to them. For since the
creation of the world, his invisible
attributes are clearly seen, being
understood by the things that are made,
even his eternal power and godhead, so
that they are without excuse. Hear the
word of the Lord. And again, according
to this text, the things that are made
understand God's eternal power and
godhead, including men who suppress the
truth in
unrighteousness. The apostle here is not
arguing that they know there's a God.
He's arguing they know
God. But he goes farther than that in
chapter 2:es 14 and 15. He says, "When
Gentiles who do not have the law, by
nature do the things in the law, these,
although not having the law, are a law
to themselves, who show the work of the
law written in their hearts, their
conscience also bearing witness, and
between themselves their thoughts
accusing or else excusing
them." Hear me on this, brothers and
sisters. Conscience is not simply a
construct of culture. Conscience is not
just a function of what your parents
teach you, your teachers, your coaches,
your mentors, what have you. There are
certain things that are written
indelibly on the heart. They are
inescapable. There are certain things,
said a different way, there are certain
things man cannot not
know. You can fight against that
knowledge, but you can't make it go
away. Their sin, what he's describing,
their sin was not an issue of denying
what they did not know. It was a sin of
rebellion against and rejection of the
God to whom they know they are
accountable. Paul argues in verse 15,
which is still on the screen. There's
clear evidence of this. The clear
evidence is they show the work of the
law written in their hearts, their
conscience also bearing witness and
between themselves their thoughts
accusing or else excusing them. Now
that's kind of an interesting phrase
there at the end. Their thoughts
accusing them. I think what he's
describing there is they feel guilty
when they do
wrong. And when he says or else excusing
them when they do right they criticize
others who are doing wrong. Although if
they don't believe in God, where do they
go for
truth? If they don't go to God for
truth, they're just making it
up. That's their st. This is going to
devolve into nonsense and absurdity very
quickly. So number one, God has left
this divine sticky note, right? Not to
argue his existence, but to remind us he
is. And that that witness is conscience.
Number two, the witness of godward
longing. Again, we set the table for
this witness in our
introduction. We spoke of Paul on Mars
Hill in Acts chapter 17. Here's an
extract from that, verses 22 and 23. As
I was passing through and considering
the objects of your worship, I even
found an altar with this inscription to
the unknown God. Has that ever struck
you that they put up an idol, an image
to the unknown God? Now, for years, I
thought this was sort of like uh
somebody that I knew once who went to
Catholic mass on Saturday night,
Presbyterian church on Sunday morning,
as she said, just to cover all the
bases. There's more to it here than
that. Therefore, the one whom you
worship without knowing him I proclaim
to you. On some level, these pagans knew
that their many, many, many idols failed
to acknowledge the God they could not
even name anymore.
As we noted earlier, Paul quoted their
own poets in verse number 28. In him we
live and move and have our being and for
we are also his offspring. If you're
wondering, there's a philosopher
Epimeites in uh a work called Credica.
Uh he quotes that first part. In him we
live and move and have our
being. By the way, in him we live and
move and have our being. Do you see that
in that there's implicit a moral
requirement? In him, we live and move
and have our being. That's pointing to a
creator. And if I'm created in him to
live and move and have being, there's a
moral requirement to be as I was created
or or an immoral element to
not. Uh we are also his offspring.
That's a quote from Cissian Stoic
philosopher Eridus in a piece called him
to Zeus. Even even the atheist
philosopher Nietz spoke of his sense of
gratitude. He spoke of a sense of
gratitude that he had the sense of
gratitude to
whom I'll tell you to whom? to God he
knew he was accountable to. Number
three, God's
handiwork. Again, we laid the foundation
for this witness already. Romans chapter
1 verse number 20. For since the
creation of the world, his invisible
attributes are clearly seen, being
understood by the things that are made,
even his eternal power and godhead, so
that they are without excuse.
Brothers and sisters, when I talk about
divine sticky
notes, the reminders that God is are too
numerous to even step through them all.
They're everywhere. It's
inescapable. Think about some of these.
The Earth's perfect distance from the
sun.
Perfect. A little bit closer, we can't
survive. A little bit farther away, we
can't
survive. It's got a perfect tilt. And
that perfect tilt brings seasons. In
Florida, I know you don't know about
that, but there are seasons in other
parts of the world. There are actually
four of them. Not just hot and
not. Think about the
perfect composition of
air so that we can breathe. The perfect
composition of
water.
Perfect. The perfect design of birds for
the air. The perfect design of fish for
the sea. The perfect design of animals
for the land. The perfect complement of
male and female. Not just human.
The perfect compliment of male and
female. Think about
taste. Anybody like to
eat? This takes
work. I like to eat. I enjoy flavor.
Don't
you? Something that's really
good. We have
taste not just to sort the edible from
the inedible, but we get flavors.
Flavor. Have you ever had a flavor in
your mouth that was so good it made you
close your eyes and maybe
cry? If you haven't, you need to expand
your world, my
man. There's food out
there. It gets beyond mac and cheese.
Think about
hearing. Hearing not just to detect
danger, but music that moves
us. Babies, little children who barely
can sit up, have had musical pieces
played for them and the emotion
overtakes them.
Then there are the
heavens. Psalm
19:1, the heavens declare the glory of
God and the firmament shows his
handiwork. You realize the heavens
declare that is quite different from the
scriptures
declare. God's word tells us plainly
that no one needs proof that God exists.
They know. We all
know. Number four,
design. While closely related to the
last witness, the witness of God's
handiwork, the witness of design goes
deeper. Again, I am not here advocating.
If you're thinking, I've heard this
before, design demands a designer. Nope.
Not where I'm going. This is not what
I'm talking about now. Because design
demands a designer is this sort of
general appeal to get you to believe in
some sort of a of a uh a theistic
creature out there somewhere. I don't
think that's what the scripture tells
us. The scripture tells us we know God.
Not
monotheism. God. Can you hear me,
church? This witness takes note of
creative implications.
In other words, we see God in
us. We see God in us. A reminder that we
are created in his image, in his
likeness. I'll go back just to make this
point. We talked a minute ago about
flavors. All kidding aside, to be able
to taste flavors that evoke emotion or
to hear music that evokes uh
emotion, these have nothing to do with
Darwin.
That has nothing to do with survival of
the fittest. Instead, they remind us
that we were we were created in the
image of God who himself makes
choices, who himself
loves, who himself inspires joy, who
himself is benevolent beyond
reason. For example, the perfect
compliment of male and female. I
mentioned that in the previous
witness. And hold on to your socks for a
minute. I'm going to try to not be too
earthy, but I'll try to get you to my
point and get you to understand what we
mean here by design and how it's
pointing us that we are created in his
image and likeness. It's a reminder that
God is not that there is a God, but God
is. So, the perfect complement of male
and female. Let's say that a different
way. Men are made for women and women
are made for men.
This has moral implications. Just that
creative fact has moral
implications. I'll illustrate or I'll
try to. And again, I know there are
little ears here, so I'll try to be not
too earthy. Would you agree that our
bodies to some degree have a language
all their
own? If you're struggling a bit with
that, if that's a little bit of a leap,
let me make the point for you. How
different is a ballroom dance from a
salsa or a belly
dance? Each one may be a dance, but they
telegraph a very different image and
message. Y'all with me on this? So if
our bodies have a language all their
own, God's design is for perfect
complimentary union that oh by the way
results in another perfect
union and that seed of life is then
planted in a garden that will cultivate
that new life until it is ready for
birth. Y'all following me so far?
When that design is rejected for an
altogether different type of union, what
message are those bodies communicating
with their
acts? Except perhaps life be swallowed
up in
death. If you've read this passage,
Romans 1:26-27, and just thought that's
harsh, what I'm suggesting to you is God
has left sticky notes of his existence
and our accountability to him
everywhere. This should not be uh wow,
that's shocking
revelation. For this reason, God gave
them up to vile passions. What reason?
That they had rejected
him. that they had rejected him. For
this reason, God gave them up to vile
passions. Even their women exchanged the
natural use for what is against nature.
Likewise also the men, leaving the
natural use of the woman, burned in
their lust for one another, men with men
committing what is shameful, and
receiving in themselves the penalty of
their error which was
due. The principle of design. By the
way, even this this is not uh intended
to be some slap of judgment and
hatefulness. It's a call back to the God
who created us and in Christ gave us the
ability to be recreated once again. Can
you see
that? Number five and last, the
principle of
harvest. The principle of harvest is
that there are consequences to our
choices.
There are consequences to our choices.
And by the way, here's a free one for
you parents. You do not do your children
any favors when you try to shield them
from this
reality. Make bad decisions, deal with
bad consequence. That's a fact of life.
You don't have you reap what you sow.
You do not have to read your Bible to
know that that's woven into the fabric
of our world. And consequences imply
accountability.
But accountability to
whom? Some would try to argue that
accountability is just a social
construct, that we're really only
accountable to ourselves and to anyone
else that we choose to
be. I'll give you an example. There are
many who still maintain that sexual
freedom does not hurt anyone. So, it's
nobody's business but our own.
Really, sexual freedom. Some of you are
old enough to remember the sexual
revolution of the
60s. Yeah, that'll hurt nobody. We're
just loving each other.
Really? Go back and look at some
statistics about disease that went off
the charts. Broken trust, divorce,
violence against women, violence against
children, abortion, fatherlessness,
poverty. I'm just getting warmed up. Do
I need to keep going? We can pretend,
but that's all it is is a pretense. The
Bible says plainly for this reason, God
is not mocked. Whatever a man sws that
he will also
reap. So five witnesses from God's
general
revelation. Again, our text was God did
not leave himself without witness in
that he did good. He gave us rain from
heaven and fruitful seasons, filling our
hearts with food and gladness. Folks,
what I'm trying to suggest to you is
more often than not, what Christians do
is we accept the world's proposition
that sin is simply a matter of not
knowing any
better. That sin is a function of well,
I was forced into it because of
circumstances. But what the Bible
teaches us from the very beginning is
that man and woman in
paradise with perfect knowledge of God's
perfect word took a forbidden fruit
still. They were armed with the best
information. They were in the best
possible circumstances and they still
took a forbidden fruit.
Why? They wanted
it. Why do we
sin? because we want our sin more than
we want to glorify
God. That's the painful
truth. The heart of man's sin problem is
not an intellectual problem. The heart
of man's sin problem is a heart problem.
It's a valition problem. It's a will
problem. We are sinful people. And our
task as his church, his bride, is not to
teach people something about which they
have no clue. It is rather to spotlight
selfdeceptions about the many clues
pointing all of us to what at one time
we all simply didn't want to know. By
the way, the implication of that
statement is people will resist. Can you
appreciate
that? And it makes sense, doesn't it? If
they resist their own consciences
attempts to point them back to what's
good and right, why would they not
resist our
attempts? And the suppression of truth
is worse in a culture with a Christian
history because now people have to
suppress not only their knowledge of
general re revelation but also their
knowledge of special
revelation. The Bible says in Psalm
53:1, "The fool has said in his heart,
there is no God." You want to know what
a fool
is? The fool says there's no
God. That's not a judgment of his
intellect.
That's a moral
charge. Proverbs 1:7, "The fear of the
Lord is the beginning of
knowledge. But fools despise wisdom and
instruction." Said another way, "How do
you know that you know?" You cannot know
anything unless you start with
God. Because how do you know that you
know?
Ultimately, every truth claim ever made,
every single one can be sorted into one
of two. I said piles. I should have
probably said stacks or whatever
buckets. God has told us so. And God is
all knowing and therefore I've got
confidence in what I know.
Or we made it
up. And you can try to package that
neatly. We've reasoned. We've
studied. But we made it up.
God is not a God we can reason
to. He is the God we cannot reason
without. I'm going to close with uh a
short illustration, short story, and
then the lesson will be
yours. Years ago, about the same time
that we lost Garrett or Garrett lost us,
however that worked out, I decided that
my days of playing baseball, playing
softball needed to be augmented in some
way by uh also umpiring. And so I had a
a co-orker who talked me into that. I
thought, "Sure, I'll give it a try."
That was a
lot. But when I first got on the field
to call my first game, especially when I
was first behind the plate, but when I'm
first out there, I'm calling balls and
strikes and outs. And when I first got
out there, if I got any push back at all
on a call that I made, I felt compelled
to take my critics aside and explain to
them the rules of the game more
accurately.
Imagine how that went
over. Rules to be an umpire. Then I
really figured out how little of the
game I knew. But I soon abandoned the
approach of wanting to explain the rules
all the time.
I realized that I had been entrusted
with officiating a game according to the
rules. It was my job to know the rules
and it was my job to then enforce the
rules on the field. How did that look? I
was standing behind a plate. I had a
batter that looked at it was a call and
I had called it a strike. And he stepped
back and he looked back at me and he
said, "That sure looked like a ball."
And I said, "Yep, it sure did." Right up
until I called it a strike.
play and that was the end of the
discussion. We moved on when I tried to
explain. No, no, no. You don't
understand. When the ball comes across,
if any part of the ball crosses any part
of the plate, when it's it just devolves
into nonsense, an argument. Well, the
ball wasn't there. It was there. That
sure looked like a ball. Yep. Right up
until I called it a strike. Now, what is
it? It's a strike.
Play. What I'm saying by that is it it
didn't matter if half of them disagreed
with me. every
call. The final word was mine. I was the
umpire. Y'all, y'all hearing
this? I want to revisit
this this story. Acts
17:22-33. I don't have the time to read
the whole thing again. What I want to do
is I want to go all the way to the
end and add verses 32,33 and 34. When
they heard of the resurrection of the
dead, some mocked. Others said, "We'll
hear you again on this matter." So Paul
departed from among them. However, some
men joined him and believed. Among them,
Dionius the Aropagite, a woman named
Damaris, and others with
them. Can you see
it? Pay
attention. What Paul did in his speech
was he appealed to what their poets have
said that was a truth of God he knew
that they already
knew. And then he talked about God and
he talked about judgment to come and
their accountability to him which again
the Bible tells us they already
know. And he said God's given assurance
of this and that he's raised him from
the dead. What was the reaction from the
crowd? Pay attention. Look at it again.
Some mocked. What' they mock about? They
mocked about resurrection of the
dead. They didn't argue with him about
the existence of God. They mocked about
the resurrection of the dead. Others
said, "We'll hear you again on this
matter." Not right now. Let's push it
off till another day. But no one argued
with him according to the text about the
existence of God. In fact, there were
some who joined him and
believed. The Bible says in John 3:1 19
and 20, "Light has come into the world."
This is Jesus speaking, by the way.
Light has come into the world, and men
love darkness rather than light because
their deeds were evil. For everyone
practicing evil hates the light and does
not come to the light, lest his deeds
should be
exposed. As one brother put it, "If we
lack the courage of our
convictions, then others will have the
courage of their lack of
convictions." My prayer for us is that
we will be therefore wise as
serpents and harmless as doves. That's
right out of Matthew
10:16. Wise as serpents and harmless as
doves, bold and
courageous, gentle and kind as we bear
the holy word of our loving God. You
hear me on this? I'm not advocating we
go out and we be ugly to
people. If you heard that, you didn't
hear me right. I'm saying people know
and they're fighting that knowledge. And
our task is to remind them that the same
God who holds them accountable has
provided them a way of
escape. Do you know how I know that?
Because he helped me
escape. Hadn't he helped you
escape? You can know what I know of
grace that I don't
deserve. Of love that I can't I cannot
even fathom it. You can know it,
too. The only thing holding us back is
faithlessness. If we don't really
believe
it this morning, if there's a way that
we can help you in your walk, if you
need to be more dedicated to walking
with Jesus, you can make that known. If
you've never named the name and you're
ready to name the name, to confess him
before men, repenting of your sins,
being immersed, to rise in uh newness of
life, we're prepared to help you this
morning. Whatever your need might be,
please come while we stand while we
sing.
