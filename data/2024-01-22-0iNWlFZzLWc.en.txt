good evening
church hopefully I'll keep my voice
through this if I don't we'll get out a
little
early if you're new to us thank you for
coming our way I want to go out of my
way just a little bit here and and say a
couple of thank yous one I want to thank
um Keegan this morning I thought the
lesson he gave was excellent I think it
answered a lot of questions for a lot of
people it's something that we're trying
to work on to explain our Grand Vision
if you will and um Keegan's going to
present another lesson Lord Willie next
week on this same theme and so it's
really important to us that people
understand why we're kind of doing this
and how we're doing it and it's
ultimately an Outreach
effort and Only God you know knows how
many apples are in a seed
anybody can count how many seeds are in
an apple and so it's up to God really
ultimately to take this wherever he
wishes it to go again I also need to
thank everybody for the way y'all been
for
us uh this last week second round of
sickness we had it was the flu there was
a real flu so it wasn't something you
wanted to be a part of I promise you and
um I want to thank everybody that and we
so much stuff was sent to us and we we
didn't really want to eat we weren't
hungry at all and went the whole week
just about not eating but we were sent
fruit thank you it was way more than we
could eat sent food soups um then of
course there were cards God bless you
for that and then of course the prayers
really you've been so good thank you so
much for being so kind um it's good to
be on my two feet in front of you right
now so thank you and uh thank the good
Lord um last three this is like supposed
to be a third and a three-part series
and it is the third but I'm only doing
the two two of them so we can move on
because it wasn't meant to dominate that
much of the landscape we're looking at
what we must remember and we we must
remember Christ and that was about the
Lord's Supper as you
recall and then was a couple of weeks
skipped in between and what supposed to
be last week I supposed to be we need to
remember about love our first love from
Revelation Chapter 2 and then we're
looking at this week we must remember
Purity which is really Revelation three
um for we get into that lesson though
let's let's have a word of prayer
together pray with
me our Holy
Father I don't know how to express it
more than this but we always need you
we're grateful for every thing you do
for
us especially sometimes the things we
didn't know that you were doing and how
you work them out for
us right now father we need help always
to remember how important Purity
is sometimes in the middle of talking
about biblical things father we talk
about Christ and we do talk about love
and and Grace and we for for get how
important it is that you've called us to
Purity to be pure to be clean to be
undefiled to live separate holy
separated sacred
lives
unsoiled help us to not forget that
that's our
calling help us to realize that that's
not just about the flesh it's about
every aspect of our life
we pray father that you'll help us to
maybe just a little bit more because of
what we look at tonight determin to
remember to be holy it's in the name of
Jesus we pray
amen I want to read just a little bit
again I going to just read focusing
mainly on verse four you have a few
names in Sardis who have not defiled
their garments have not defiled their
their
garments and they shall walk with me in
white for they are worthy he overcomes
will be clothed in white
garments Purity is difficult to
maintain I mean absolute Purity it's
extremely difficult and most of the time
like I said people tend to think about
it fleshly wise being pure fleshly and
of course that's in part a large portion
of it in fact but it it's not the only
way that we can be be pure I give you an
example of that the three boys were
boasting about their dad back in the day
when such things were done and so uh
each one of them said well my dad is the
fastest guy first one said my dad's
faster because he can shoot a bow an ARA
and shoot ARA and he can run to the
Target and be there by the time it
strikes and the second boy said well
that's nothing my dad's so fast he can
shoot his rifle at a deer and be there
when the Deer Falls
over the third voice says I got both you
guys beat my dad is so fast he gets off
work at 4:00 and he's home by
3:30 that's a type of
defilement that's also a type of
impurity but we don't think about that
it's called lying to your boss
lying to your company Purity requires
putting off that old
man Colossians 3 says but now you
yourselves are to put off these things
anger wrath malice
blasphemy filthy language out of your
mouth do not lie to one another since
you've put off the old man with his
deeds in 1 Timothy 5:22 it says keep
yourself Pure or sacred or holy where
that's our
job and we sometimes forget
that it's our everyday job it's not a
fancy
job we fail but it is our everyday job
so I want us to look at that for just a
moment if you don't mind and walk our
way through just three little thoughts
and then I'll be done number
one these are just helps these are helps
to help us in this text I believe
that will help us to try to meain some
sense of Purity that maybe we don't
always do we can remain pure and UND
theile by remembering our
Redemption I know that may sound funny
but I think sometimes we forget we've
been
redeemed in our daily walk he
says verse
three remember therefore how you
have
received and
heard and hold fast and
repent do you
remember have you
forgotten has it been that
long that you forgot what it was like to
come up out of that
water do you still remember do you
remember what night or what day it
was where were you at what
church when it hit
you and when it hit you and all you
could do is cry about
it you remember that time second Peter
1: 5-9 says but also for this very
reason giving all diligence add to your
faith virtue to Virtue knowledge to
knowledge self-control to self-control
perseverance to perseverance godliness
to Godliness brotherly kindness and
brotherly kindness love for if these
things are yours and abound you will be
neither barren nor unfruitful in the
knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ for
He Who lacks these things is
shortsighted even to blindness and has
listen to this and has
forgotten that he was
cleansed who would have thought we would
have done
that have we been a Christian so
long that we
forgot have you been blessed so long
that you don't have an appreciation
for what you
have that that Purity that you received
on the night that you gave your life to
the Lord do you remember what it felt
like for the first time being
clean that feeling of absolutely knowing
it was all finally wiped away and that
all you've done is
gone that was a good feeling wasn't
it um Brandon Lake Cody KS and and Hank
Bentley wrote that ain't nobody I'm not
going to sing it for you I know you'd
love me to but it says I got a story to
good to hide I was a blind man wondering
until I saw the light yeah I got a
story I can't deny I'm a living
breathing miracle and I just got to
testify ain't nobody Love Me Like
Jesus ain't nobody love me this good
ain't nobody Love Me Like Jesus and I
know I know nobody could tell me who
could love me to give me this Freedom
tell me who could give me this far and
ain't nobody Love Me Like Jesus and I
know I know nobody could and then listen
to this and now I'm anointed to bring
the news I don't know if that's the
right terminology for what we believe
but it sure feels like this place off
and
stand and now I'm anointed to bring the
news yay
everything he did for me I know he'll do
for you he gave me a joy for the
morning for the ash is a
crown yeah I'm a walking talking miracle
and I just got to let it
out sometimes we need to
remember and I think if we
remembered what God brought us from and
maybe you were raised in the church not
me
sometimes when you remember where you
came
from makes you want to try just a little
bit harder just think about it this week
so we can remain pure I think at least
pure and a little more undefiled by
remembering our Redemption second truth
we can remain pure and
undefiled by resisting our
relaxation it goes on to say in
Revelation 3 and verse two but Be
watchful that means kind of stay on high
alert by the way staying on high alerts
no fun I like to fall asleep when I want
to fall asleep I want to take it easy
when I want to take it easy I don't want
to work that hard at Christianity I'd
like it to be like w falling off a log
don't you I want it to be easy but it
says Be watchful that means I need to be
a little bit
tense a little
tense Be watchful and strengthen the
things which remain that are ready to
die for I have not found your works
perfect before God well that's so true
of us all remember therefore how you
have received and heard and hold fast
that takes effort to hold on again a
state of tension not of
relaxation there's a tendency Within Me
to relax about my faith y'all doing that
to just
go I got this actually
no no I don't really so I need to watch
he goes on to say therefore if you will
not watch I will come upon you as a
thief watch be tense about it don't
relax too much Matthew 24:42 watch for
you do not know what hour your lord is
coming Matthew 25 13 watch for you know
neither the day nor the hour Matthew
26:38 my soul is exceeding sorrowful
stay here and watch with me Jesus says
26:40 they were asleep said what could
you not watch with me one hour what's
wrong can you not be alert can you not
be tense for just a minute um Matthew
2641 Watch and Pray lest you enter into
temptation the spirit indeed is willing
with the flesh is weak
so I think I'm not saying this is an
absolute moratorium that that if you
have this tension that you want
sin but I think it's an indicator in
this text of good
advice we can remain pure be a little
more
undefiled by resisting our tendency to
just relax it's all of Grace it's all
good so we can remain pure and undefiled
by resisting our relaxation I believe
third little truth that comes through in
this text is we can remain pure and
undefiled by re
regretting our reversion or our
reversions not that we've only had one
can you look at me just in the eye for
just a moment look at
me
I know you've done
it you've done stuff since you were a
Christian so have
I we
reverted and did some of the old
stuff shouldn't have maybe it was things
we
said maybe it's an old
attitude or maybe it was an old
sin
but it goes on to say Be watchful and
strengthen the things which remain that
are ready to die so you can die
spiritually if you're not careful for
I've not found your works perfect before
God remember therefore how you have
received and heard and hold fast and
repent repent is the idea of regretting
it we slide backwards do you regret it
maybe I'm wrong here
but does anybody remember that we used
to have a lot more people go forward I'm
not saying that that's that's
important okay listen to me I I don't
know that the church was a better place
in the fullest sense of the word when
more people walk
forward cuz I don't know that's up to
the good
Lord but what what's interesting to me
is that I I think we've lost a sense of
guilt
that's what I'm talking
about Luke 22: 31- 32 says and the Lord
said Simon Simon indeed Satan has asked
for you that he may sift you as wheat
but I prayed for you that your faith
should not fail and when you have
returned to me strengthen your breth
when you have returned so that means
you're you're going to leave
me that was Peter when you have
returned Luke 22: 60-62 it says Peter
said man I do not know what you're
saying immediately while he was still
speaking the rooster crowed and the Lord
turned and looked at
Peter
wow I've never seen
that felt it
but I've never seen
that and Peter remembered the words of
the Lord how he had said to him before
the rooster crows you will deny me three
times so Peter went out and wept
bitterly James chapter
4 this is old stuff James is
early early
thinking maybe it slides away as the
church gets older I don't
know but verse 8 says draw near to God
and He will draw near to you cleanse
your hands you
Sinners and purify your
heart
double-minded
lament and
mourn and
weep and let your laughter be turned to
mourning and your joy to
GL I don't know if you do this and I
don't know that any of us do it as much
maybe as we
should I know we do a lot of praying
asking God for
things do a little tear roll out for
what you did
wrong does that
happen are you are you beyond that now
you haven't had a tear roll out because
of what you've done wrong in years
so we can remain pure and undefiled or
at least if we regret our reversions
maybe a little
more because if we don't regret it we'll
go right back to it right without any
problem at all so that's that's the
lesson it's real simple lesson look at
these little simple things we must
remember to remember Christ we must
remember to remember love we must
remember to remember Purity but we can
be a little more pure and a little more
undefiled according to this text by
remembering our Redemption what happened
how it happened when we came to faith in
Christ and by resisting the tendency to
relax and just Coast on into glory land
by maybe regretting our reversions a
little more maybe when we sin the next
time could you maybe actually think
about it enough that you actually got
sad I'm not asking you to have a tear in
your eye but could you be sad about
it Chu Coulson y'all may remember him
from uh Richard Nixon days or is that
too far back for y'all had a lot of
people had way too far back in it Chuck
Coulson was American attorney political
advisor uh served as special counsel to
president Richard Nixon for 1969 to
1970 uh he became a Evangelical believer
had the conversion experiences pretty
radical and he ended up getting involved
in the nonprofit prison fellowship thing
that he started in 1973 and he tells
this story about this
um Brazilian
prison and I'm probably not going to
pronounce it right so I'm going to spell
it for you cuz I have no idea how to
speak Brazilian is that the
language
no Braille is that
it h u m a i t
i obviously you don't have to say it
either and so as a result he had heard
about this and
U he wanted to visit it so he
did and it was a
prison that is run by
Christians
entirely and it was so different that he
wanted to see how this worked and there
were actually families who adopted
inmates in the
prison that's unusual isn't it and these
were
Killers these are not just mild
criminals these were
Killers here's what he said I'll read
what he said he says when I
visited whatever that is I found inmates
smiling particularly the murderers who
held the keys open the gates and let me
in whenever I walked I saw men at peace
I saw clean living areas people working
industriously the walls were decorated
with Biblical sayings from the psalm in
the Proverbs my guide escorted me to the
notorious prison cell once used for
torture today he told me that the block
house is only there's only a single
inmate in there and as we reached the
end of the long concrete Corridor he put
the key in the lock and he paused and
looked at me and said are you sure you
want to go in said of
course I've been in isolation cells all
over the world so he swung the door open
as a massive door and I saw the
prisoner in that punishment
cell it was a
crucifix beautifully carved by the
inmates The Prisoner was Jesus hanging
on the
cross and the man said he's doing time
for all the rest of
us my guy said and then that cross
carved by Loving
Hands is a holy subversion it Heralds
change more radical than Mankind's most
fevered
dreams it follows expanding the orders
of a kingdom that can never
fail shining Kingdom that reaches even
into the darkness of the darkest cell of
every community in the darkest corners
of every kind a kingdom of deathless
Hope of rest Restless virtue of endless
peace and here's the
thing every man in that
prison is worthy of
death but every man out of the
prison is worthy of
death Purity is not possible I just
preached a
lesson Pur is not possible you you're
not pure not by your effort I'm not pure
by my effort I'm
not I ever since mankind has had the
knowledge of Good and Evil he's tilted
into evil pretty well
regularly sin ends in death Romans
5:12 and so it's true every man from
that time till now is
dead so I'd say
sin ends in death
we can strive for Purity and not defile
our garments and try to be as worthy as
we can be first Timothy 5:22 which we're
called to
do but the only way that we are made
righteous is that we are made
righteous 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 21
for he made him who knew no sin to be
sin for us that we might become the
righteousness of God in him God has to
do that it's a work of Christ if you're
going to be pure tonight it's not
because of this
lesson I would like to think that it
could be but it isn't it's not because
I've taught you some techniques now and
if you do those things you'll be pure
that's not true the only way you'll be
pure is by the blood of Jesus Christ he
died in your place he bore the curse for
us Galatians
3:13 he was the just one who was
declared first of God according to
Deuteronomy 2122 and 23 and it is that
just one declared a cursed of God by the
law of God by dying on a tree a cursed
of God by him dying in that place when
he did not deserve it he therefore the
unjust like you and I would never be
saved but since the just
one was declared unjust then God can now
rightfully declare the unjust just and
that's what second Peter 3:18 says
happens he makes us pure before him I
wish we could all believe that that's
true but I'm afraid that people even
come to church our young people come to
church all their lives and I think
sometimes they go out and they never
believe that they don't believe it
if they believed it they would give
their life wholly to him and they would
strive the best they could to try to
live a pure life but I'm afraid that's
not what we often see we often see our
young people turn their back on what we
believe they make fun of it they run off
they do the things they wish to do let's
pray that our young people that are
sitting here tonight do better than that
let's pray that we do better than that
let's not forget that it is the
righteousness of God given to us by the
blood of Jesus Christ that actually
makes us
pure and if you want to be pure tonight
and you haven't been you don't get it by
doing any of the things I preached
tonight you get it by the grace of God
if you're willing to come you can be
forgiven if you will repent of your sins
confess the name of Christ you can be
baptized tonight all your sins will be
washed away and you will know what it
feels like to truly be pure for the
first time why don't you come if you
need to while we stand there while we
sing
