in The Book of Mark
chapter 6.
verses 1 through 13.
once again that's the Book of Mark
chapter 6.
verses 1 through 13.
and the Bible read and the Bible reads
then he went out from there and came to
his own country and his disciples
followed him
and when the Sabbath had come he began
to teach in the synagogues and meaning
hearing him were astonished saying where
did this man get these things and what
wisdom is it is this which is given to
him
that such Mighty works are performed by
his hands
is it not the carpenter the son of Mary
and brother of James
Jose Judah and Simon
and are not his sisters here with us so
they were offended at him
but Jesus said to them a prophet is not
without honor except in his own country
among his own relatives and in his own
house
now he could do not now he could do no
Mighty works there except that he laid
his hands on a few sticks sick people
and healed them
and he marveled because of the um of the
unbelief then he went about the villages
in a circuit teaching
and he called the 12 the 12 to him
himself and began to send them out two
by two and gave them power over unclean
spirits he commanded them to take
nothing from the journey except a staff
no bag no bread no copper in their in
their money belts but to wear sandals
and not to put on two tents tunics
and he said to them in whatever place
you enter a house stay there till you
depart from that place and whosoever and
whoever will not receive you nor hear
you when you depart from there shake off
the dust under your feet
as as a testimony against him assuredly
I say to you it will not it will be more
tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the
day of the Judgment than
for for that City
so they went out and preached and
preached that people should repent
and they cast out many demons and
Anointed with oil many who were sick and
healed them
good evening to church
we are trying some new things on Sunday
night and I'm excited about the idea of
doing some different things we're only
trying uh the first Sundays as you
notice first Sunday nights we already
were doing the last Sunday nights I
actually think that we need to give more
thought to that if you have some input
on that please let the elders know what
you think about that and whether or not
you would like to have more of
variety on Sunday nights I actually
think in the world we live in at this
point without that we're losing some
people that we need to try to hang on to
I'm not saying that that holds everybody
in but I do think it holds some people
in I'm looking at tonight A Life
unaffected and this is it's not a really
a complex lesson it's not a big lesson
it's actually kind of a small lesson but
I think it's it's an important lesson
and uh it's not real fancy so don't look
for anything pizzazzy tonight but I
think it's critical that we try to be
like Jesus
particularly about this because he lived
a life
unaffected before we get into the lesson
any further though if you would uh join
with me in a word of Prayer
Holy Father we struggle
to be Christians at times we want to be
we're hungry to be good Christians we're
hungry to love you
and to love our neighbors we want to
love you with all of our heart all of
our soul and all of our strength and all
of our mind we want to do that
um
but we still keep sinning and making
mistakes
sometimes we don't want to do that
because we want to do other things
but you know us all too well so
we pray father that we really would take
a long look at Jesus
and how he was so determined
how no matter what happened he seemed to
be unaffected by what was going on that
he kept doing what you sent him to do
and he stayed true to the course and he
finished his course
and he supported what you wanted and
support and derided what you wanted to
put down and we pray father that you
would help us to stay the course and be
faithful
and live a life unaffected by the
negativity around us
please bless us in this study father we
ask it in the name of Jesus our lord
amen
there was a crow
it was about half dead and if you know
anything about crows one of the things
to tell you shouldn't really be a shock
so this crow about half dead with thirst
uh came to a pitcher of water which he
knew had had water in it and he had
probably gotten a drink from there
before but he persisted he he was
thirsty and he came to this picture of
water which was once full of water but
his beak when he stuck his beak in his
beak wouldn't reach the water
and so he's frustrated uh
there's only a very little amount of
water actually left in the pitcher
but he couldn't reach it couldn't reach
far enough down to get to the water and
he tried and he tried and if you know
anything about crows they are pretty
persistent and they don't get run off so
easily and he tried and he tried and
it looked like he'd given up in despair
but he
but a thought came to him
and you may not know this but crows are
really smart
they can count to five we know that by
some tests that have been done they're
really good problem solvers so the crow
flew away and came back with a pebble
and he went to the pitcher and he
dropped one Pebble into the pitcher and
uh
nothing so we ain't got another Pebble
and he dropped the pebble in the picture
and
we got another one
dropped it in the picture water Rose a
little bit but not enough
and then another and then another and
then another and then another and then
another
and finally after a dozen or so trips
back and forth dropping those pebbles in
there at last at the very last he saw
the water mount up near him and
after casting in just a few more Pebbles
he was able to quench his thirst save
his life
he persisted
he persevered
he was unaffected by what looked like
wasn't going to work
Stephen Bradbury
when he was 28 he was from Australia
probably the only good thing I know came
out of Australia is 28.
Australia he hasn't always been known
for his prowess on ice
uh in fact you if you knew anything
about uh Stephen Bradbury you would know
that he he was kind of like an accident
waiting to happen
and uh in fact in 1994 Bradbury now he's
one of these ice Racers you know what
I'm talking about
so in 1994 Bradbury cut his leg these
those blades are really
really sharp and he cut his leg in a
World Cup skating competition and he
almost bled to death he's lost four
liters of blood and received
111 stitches
so he was kind of looked at like a
little bit of a klutz
well in 2001
staying true to his name he crashed
headfirst into the boards while training
and broke his neck lost control smacked
into the end
and broke his neck
so he went to the doctors the doctors
told him you don't need to be doing this
anymore
you already are on the edge you need to
give up
and because if you hit the boards again
anywhere close to how you just did it
you're not going to be alive it will
ruin you forever or you won't live
he chose to defy the doctor's orders who
told him not to skate it again because
he might get permanent paralysis if not
death
and so he staged to come back even
though he'd gone through this bad cut
and now he's broke his neck and he's a
racer on the ice
so in 2002 Winter Olympic Games at Salt
Lake City some of you may remember this
if you think about it just a moment
Stephen Bradbury was by all of the
commentators comments their opinions the
least likely skater to even make it to
the finals and certainly not to win a
medal he was not going to place he's too
far behind
he won Gold
see Bradbury's Victory is quite
remarkable not only because he shouldn't
have probably been able to be there
because of his injuries
and all the setbacks he had and the
defeats that he had faced because he'd
lost quite a few games coming up there
but he won it
because as they're coming around to the
last turn
four skaters ahead of him collided with
each other and fell
and all he had to do was stand up
and in about a second it went from him
being fifth
to winning the gold medal
and all he really did
that was different I guess you could say
is he persisted
he persevered
he hadn't quit
he lived a life unaffected by the
negative things that had happened to him
and he persisted perseverance is almost
a lost trait in an instant gratification
culture that we live in the idea of
doing whatever it takes by Blood Sweat
and Tears is starting to become a rare
commodity
a good work ethic is being substituted
with a feeling of entitlement don't you
just give me a trophy because I showed
up technology fuels our microwavable and
short-suffering attitudes where we think
well everybody should be able to get one
if given a choice today
we tend to choose the path of least
resistance
we don't want it to be hard
we will just take the easy path
now the word of God calls us to be
tougher than that
well I didn't put it in there so we'll
go back the other way
I wanted you to see these other verses
but I'll I'll just read them to you the
word of God calls us to be tough
steadfast persevere and even endure it
says in Romans 5 verses 3 to 4 we glory
and tribulation
knowing tribulation produces
perseverance and perseverance character
and character hope so perseverance just
persevere First Corinthians 15 verse 58
says be steadfast immovable that means
don't let anybody push you off what you
believe be steadfast immovable always
abounding in the work of the Lord
knowing that your labor is not in vain
in the Lord and then Hebrews chapter 12
1-2 talking about Jesus and us he says
therefore we also since we are
surrounded by so great a cloud of
witnesses let us lay aside every weight
and the sin which so easily ensnares us
and let us run with endurance the race
that is set before us looking unto Jesus
the author and finisher of our faith who
for the joy that was set before him
endured the cross despising the shame
and has sat down at the right hand of
the Throne of God so Jesus endured we
are called to endure we're called to be
steadfast we're called to be immovable
we're called to perseverance we're
called to persist in the walk that we're
in it's not always easy nobody's saying
it is but that's what you're called to
do so I want to look at from that simple
idea we're going to look at two types of
people to contrast over this idea of
living a life unaffected by what's going
on around us
oh I did put them in look at that
that's a good verse we get a Reddit
moment ago
because we did and then we read that one
too
just checking with me and then we read
that one too okay I didn't know it said
a minute ago
now to the points number one sorry
that's pretty bad the critics
lived a life affected
I don't know if you have realized this
about your critics but you need to pay
attention there's always there's really
a great lesson to learn when you're
being criticized
and it's usually not to do what they
suggest you should do in Mark chapter
six we just start let's look at verses
one through five again I want to pull
some things out of it and I'll show you
then he went out from there and came to
his own country and his disciples
followed him and when the Sabbath had
come he that is Jesus began to teach in
the synagogue many hearing him were
astonished now it's interesting
initially their response is very similar
what you're going to see about Jesus in
just a minute Jesus is Marvel's they're
astonished saying but look at their
reaction it's astonishment that goes
this way where did this man get these
things and what wisdom is this which is
given to him that such Mighty works are
performed by his hands so they go from
astonishment to criticism
and then to questioning him asking these
questions verse 3 says is this not the
carpenter the son of Mary and brother of
James Joseph Judas and Simon Simon and
are not his sisters here with us and
they were offended so he goes from being
astonished
to questioning
and then they're offended at him
I'll follow with this just a second use
I'm really trying to make a point here
verse 4 but Jesus said to them a prophet
is not without honor except in his own
country and among his own relatives and
in his own household obviously in your
own house you know you're just the other
stinky guy okay verse 5. now he could do
no Mighty work there now this is not
this may not be this has been made so
much about especially among Pentecostals
it just simply means this he can't
perform a miracle if you don't bring
them to him
and so if you don't believe you don't
bring them you don't come to listen so
it isn't a case of not having the power
he just couldn't do it because he didn't
he could do no Mighty work there except
that he laid his hands on a few sick
people and held them so it wasn't a case
of a lack of power as a case of lack of
people coming to it so but here's what I
want you to see this is verse two they
were astonished I don't know if I'll put
those up there maybe I did
no I didn't okay we'll come back to it a
minute
maybe I did
no I didn't what happened there
okay stay with me
I live in the
caveman days
okay there they are sorry they were up
there so what I want you to see is this
is their reaction they live a life
that's affected by what's going on
around them
a critic's life is not live the way a
disciplined Christian's life has lived
it's lived differently
they are astonished at things and if you
pay attention to our culture right now
you will pick up on this happening they
are shocked
and then they start making questions as
if their questions alone
proves that whatever you've done or
think is wrong
just because you ask a question doesn't
mean you've proved anything they're
offended
and then it says in in a very real way
they're very disrespectful to him
because they don't give him the honor he
deserved as the Son of God or or even as
a prophet
so he doesn't even get the prophet's
honor but verse 5 clearly indicates that
they were therefore not used
they were not going to engage him that's
why there was no Miracles done wasn't a
lack of power it's because they wouldn't
engage him
here's some truths to add to that
and when you know this or not you need
to know this especially if you teach a
Bible class if you're an elder here if
you're a deacon here and you're leading
a Ministry if you teach a Bible class
you need to know a couple of things
about critics
critics can't take it
they can dish it out but they cannot
take it
that's one of the reasons they attack
you
is because you will have stepped on some
bunion that they have
and they go after you
you've offended them how dare you who do
you think you are to talk to them like
that
if that feeling ever comes over you
recognize you're actually playing like a
Critic
Stay With Me
so critics can't take criticism
they can give it
but they can't take it
and critics are crowd followers and
culture followers they don't find the
path
from the scriptures
they follow the path of the herd
don't follow the herd
and critics get offended and when
critics get offended if you don't jump
they quit
now pay attention to this because
critics live lives that are affected by
all that's going on
we don't live that way
critics set against the Christ lived a
life that was affected next was
there we go thank you
the Christ lived a life unaffected
look at how he behaves in this just
three little thoughts that we're going
to look at here but let's start in verse
six
and he marveled so they were astonished
he Marvels because of their unbelief so
when a Critic comes after you usually
you're going to Marvel at how they're
behaving
Marvel at their unbelief then he went
about the villages in a circuit wait why
didn't he quit
when he quit go home
you know what you're supposed to do when
you're criticized
just quit and go home I'm not going to
take this if somebody's going to say
something ugly about my Bible class I'm
going to go home I'm never going to
teach again
and somebody said something about my
Ministry I ain't going to do it again
I'm never going to go to that church
again because somebody hurt my feelings
up there
okay
well that's not what he did what he
actually did is he did more
so he went from marveling at their
unbelief instead of giving up at it he
increased the velocity and increased the
volume he went about the villages in a
circuit now listen what this what it
means a circuit
instead of just he poured on the cold
you pick up what he did
he didn't back off
he cranked it up
but wait he did more verse 7 and he
called The Twelve to himself and began
to send them out two by two and gave
them power over unclean spirits and he
commanded them to take nothing for the
journey except for staff no bag no bread
no copper in their money belts but to
wear sandals and not to put on two
tunics he's bracing them
not only is he putting them out there
we're going to go from me going by
myself to now all of you going out there
more than that I'm telling you you need
to prepare yourself this is not going to
be easy and he said to them in whatever
place you enter a house stay there until
you depart from that place and whoever
will not receive you wait how is that
going to happen everybody's going to
receive the Apostles of Jesus I mean
they're just going to be loved it's
going to be wonderful everybody loves
the Apostles of Jesus because they would
never be a problem to anybody whoever
will not receive you nor hear you when
you depart from there shake off the what
an ugly thing to do and what in the
world would he teach his disciples to do
such an ugly thing
you ever seen anybody do that at your
house walk out your house ago don't want
any of your dirt on me
that almost sounds like an ugly thing
doesn't it
yeah when you depart from there and
shake off the dust under your feet as a
testimony against them assuredly I say
to you it will be more tolerable for
Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of
judgment than for that City that's quite
a statement in it verse 12 so they went
out and preached that people should
repent
wait a minute shouldn't they just preach
that Jesus is here
now they needed to change
verse 13 and they cast out many demons
well there's plenty out there and an
only with all many who were sick and
heal them
here's the things
it did move I see now what it did I put
I had to put it up there because it
wouldn't fit now I remember what it did
how about that
I'm getting old folks can't remember
what it did the other day
here's the thing you need to see
he didn't get depressed
he just lit a fire under him
he did more he went from what he was
doing to doing more of what he was doing
and then he expanded he sent more people
out
so the Christ
sent to the detractors and he lived a
life
unaffected and by that this is what I
mean look look at this simple concept
here
I don't think he's moving there we go
it's a really simple concept and that is
that the critics live a life that's
affected by everything going on around
them and but the Christ he just kept
doing what he was doing if any if it
affected him at all he just did more of
it so I I will tell you this
some of you will never be involved
you're only going to be observers I
believe you go to heaven like that I do
I believe the grace of God covers you
but I don't think that's what you're
called to do
I think you're called to engage but by
engaging you're going to have some
problems
and you're gonna if you're not careful
you'll end up like the critics
and you'll be one that's affected and
you'll think that your job is to
critique everything rather than engaging
we are called First Corinthians 11 and
verse 1 Paul says it imitate me just as
I also imitate Christ we're to imitate
Christ we are to live a life that's
unaffected so when the harder path comes
we just keep doing what we were doing
before
we just live the tougher way
and I know that's not fancy
it's not even popular today
but the message tonight is persist
persevere
live a life unaffected
do the right thing
and don't let anything not a critical
church not a Critic in the world not a
Critic out here in the news I mean some
of y'all watching the news and let it
determine how you're going to feel that
day don't let it affect you
it has nothing to do just keep doing the
right thing if you're going to let it
affect you at all you just increase the
volume and do more of it
just just be more of what Christ calls
you to be
there is a
a poem
and speaks to this to me and that is the
road not taken by Robert Frost do they
teach poetry in school now literature do
they teach literature and poetry in
school
they don't do they not teach that
anymore they used to be required is that
not required anymore do you get poetry
in literature in school
you do get it okay yeah he'll heal he's
got it okay so Robert Frost
poetry is great it says things that in a
way that you don't can't get it any
other way Robert fost The Road Not Taken
listen to these words because it's
actually quite good I mean he did a good
job of this two roads diverge in a
yellow wood
and sorry I could not travel both
and be one Traveler
long I stood and looked down one as far
as I could to where it bent in the
undergrowth I stood there and I really
wanted to go both rays
but you can't go both ways
then took the other as just as fair I
mean it looked just as pretty and having
for perhaps the better claim
because oh it look maybe even better
because it was grassy
and wanted wear and obviously not as
many people went down that road those
for that the passing there had warned
them really about the same it wasn't
that much difference
and both that morning
equally lay in leaves
no step had trodden black oh I kept the
first for another day
yet knowing how way leads on the way
I doubted if I should ever come back
young people
you only get one shot
the the path is going to be one or the
other
you really only get one shot I'm not
saying you can't go down One path and
not change but that's rare
you get one shot you get one pathway
look at the last thing it says
I shall be telling this with a sign
somewhere ages and ages hence
two roads diverged in a wood and I
I took the one last travel by
and that has made all the difference
now if you look around you young people
that's what all these older folks are
trying to do
take the One Less Traveled by
it's not easy but you know what you got
to persist uh there was a man in a
siberian prison camp his name was souls
and neatson you may have heard about him
even read about him
he was kind of against his government
and so he was cast into one of these
gulags
and even about given up he'd been in
there long enough
he's in there a long time years
one day I mean they just gave them the
most horrendous work to do and just
nearly kill you if you survived it was
amazing
even given hard work to do that day but
it wasn't all that much different than
any other day but you know when it's
grind and y'all may know this about work
work can just grind at you but this work
was so hard because it's prison camp
and it just grinded on him
so he got depressed
he was in despair
now if you tended to give up and stop
working you could have your guard pick
up your shovel and bludgeon you
or shoot you right there
it's not uncommon
but that day
he just gave up
I'm done
he laid his shovel down
and he walked away he thought well shoot
me any moment
I don't care
I'm done
so he walked quite a ways
until he saw like a log over there
and he thought any moment they'll shoot
me
or they'll come over and take the shovel
and kill me but I'm just done
and he sat down on the log
and then all of a sudden someone started
walking out behind him and he just
thought okay here comes the bullet
here comes the shovel
that said no it was one of his fellow
prisoners
prisoner came up
sat down beside him didn't say a word
not one word
picked up a stick
took that stick
and Drew on the ground
and got up
and walked away
without ever saying a word
chosen eats and said and it changed my
life
all he did
was through the sign of the cross
on the ground
and suddenly
I thought I've been consumed with myself
and lost track
my life needs to be about the cross
not about how I feel about everything
else
Christ's
and even solzhenitzen
changes things because they don't change
if you don't change you do the right
thing you do the right thing today you
do the right thing tomorrow you do the
right thing tonight you do the right
thing Monday you do the right thing
Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday you
do the right thing on your birthday you
do the right thing on a holiday you do
the right thing when your boss
criticizes you you do the right thing
when your friend criticizes you do the
right thing when you get in a fight with
your mate you do the right thing you
know just do the right thing and keep
being persistently right it's not the
easy thing to do but it is what Jesus
did Jesus just did the right thing he
persisted he lived a life unaffected and
that's your challenge that's my
challenge so if you're here tonight and
you've been letting the world affect you
we'd like to encourage you to come back
to the cross
pick it up again and serve the Lord if
you've never given your life to the Lord
this is a perfect opportunity you can
repent of your sins confess the name of
Christ be baptized it take us a few
minutes but we can work it out won't you
come if you need to why don't we stand
the one we sing
