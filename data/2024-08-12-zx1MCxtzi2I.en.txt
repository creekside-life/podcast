Paul David trip set this chapter off
like this the foolishness inside your
children is more dangerous to them than
the Temptation outside of them only
God's Grace has the power to rescue
fools and I know that goes against the
grain today uh but all of our children
have foolishness in their heart that
includes your children and by the way
children that includes you but by the
way all you adults that includes you as
well CU you were
children Rex uh you better not teach
that or say that about my precious
little Johnny I'm sorry your little
Johnny has a lot of foolishness in them
well my child is not foolish and saying
that could hurt their little
hearts well I don't think so because
their little heart's foolish and uh they
need to know the truth
Proverbs 2015 again foolishness is bound
up in the heart of a child that's a
truth it isn't up for a debate it is
true has your little Sweet Child ever
caused you
grief has your sweet little child ever
caused you sadness has your sweet little
child ever stepped all over your heart
has your sweet little child ever caused
bitterness
well if you were a little bit honest
just for a moment probably all those
feelings have been in because there's
foolishness bound up in heart of a job
proverbs 10 and verse one says this a
foolish son is the grief of his
mother Proverbs
15:5 a foolish person despises his
father's
instruction and then Proverbs 17
21 the father of a fool has no
joy Proverbs 17:25 a foolish son is a
grief to his father and bitterness to
her Who Bore him Proverbs 19 and verse
13 a foolish son is the ruin of his
father now the problem with all
that is that means every family has
struggled with this
you know you know you might not think
that you were foolish when you were
little but I remember when I was about
five and I believed I could
fly and my mom made my brother who was
mad as I went H build me some wings out
of boards and then made me jump off of
as high a place as he could get me on
foolishness is bound up in the heart of
a child by the way I did not fly but I
was sure I was going to
all of our children are full of
foolishness as we were and
are we still plenty of foolishness to go
around with us
adults and so 1 Corinthians 13:1 says
when I was a
child I spoke as a child I understood as
a child I thought as a child but when I
became a man I put away childish things
and so children understand foolishness
for it is in their heart that's the
reason he says when I was a child I
understood as a child they understand
foolishness that's the reason
foolishness is bound up in the heart of
the child then it says that basically
verse 11 when I was a child I spoke as a
child so children speak
foolishness for it's in their heart
Proverbs 12:23 the heart of fools Pro
proclaims foolishness Matthew 12:34 of
the abundance of the heart the mouth
speaks so I assume that since
foolishness is bound up in the the heart
of a child foolish things come out of CH
children's mouths and by the way
according to what we read in Matthew
7:16 through 18 talking about fruit and
Luke 16:45 the words are the fruit of
your heart so foolish words comes out of
you it's a sign of foolishness being in
your heart and children think foolish
things because it's bound up in their
heart it says when I was a child I
thought as a child we all did Proverbs
23:7 says as he thinks in his heart so
is he Proverbs 1:7 says fools desire
wisdom and instruction I mean despise I
didn't say I said desire it's despise
wisdom instruction Proverbs 1:22 says
fools hate knowledge that's the reason
kids don't really appreciate school
don't really want to be at school don't
really want to be taught Proverbs 12:15
the way of a fool is right in his own
eyes I already know enough I'm smart
enough I'm already smarter than my
parents Proverbs 13:19 is an Abomination
to fools to depart from Evil I'm having
fun I don't want to quit Proverbs 148
the F Folly of fools is deceit so they
lie about stuff you say oh my kids would
never lie I guarantee every one of your
kids have lied to you about
something Proverbs 14:9 fools mock at
sin they make fun of it oh that's not so
bad it is proverbs 14:24
the foolishness of fools is folly so the
best thing you can see is kids like to
play and be silly often that's just the
truth and you say I don't like he's
saying this it's going to maybe hurt
some of our kids' feelings they got to
get over it because it's true but the
truth is that children then leave
foolishness that's in their hearts
because it says when I became a man I
put away childish things some of that
foolishness has to go away not all of it
but some of it has to go away because
you have to make it in this world and
even if you're not a follower of Christ
some of it has to go away you can't keep
functioning on the level of a child
Proverbs 9:6 says forsake foolishness
and live if you want to live in this
world you can't keep doing some of the
things that you would do as a child
that's just all there is to it and your
child's Foolish Heart problem is caused
by something that you can't talk out of
them they need Jesus they need need
God's word they need God's commands they
need God's wise teaching that's the
reason Deuteronomy 6 veres 5 and 6 says
you shall love the Lord your God with
all your heart and these words which I
command you today shall be in your heart
the word has to be in your heart if you
want to push some of that foolishness
out and you say I'm not foolish you are
foolish and so am I I have a problem
with foolishness now oh said well I've
prayed for wisdom that means you think
you got all wisdom that there is oh no
you don't no you don't there's still
foolish you could still pray for for
wisdom I don't care who you are you can
still pray for wisdom it'd be good for
you Deuteronomy 8:5 says you shall know
in your heart that as a man chastens his
son so the Lord your God chastens you
but that's something growing up you've
got to learn you get to be about 25
years old somewhere in that neighborhood
maybe 30 and all of a sudden you realize
maybe your parents weren't as dumb as
you thought they were in fact with years
going on you start thinking you know I
think maybe Mom and Dad actually did
know something and maybe they were right
maybe maybe those spankings were
actually good for me maybe when they
told me no that they were actually doing
me a favor and I didn't realize it at
the time I just thought they were trying
to wreck my life Proverbs
4:23 keep your heart with all diligence
for out of it Springs the issues of life
keep means to watch to guard to keep
like military situation you protect it
you have to protect your heart that's a
process and you get better at it maybe a
little bit better at it as you get older
trip goes on to suggest some basic
advice for how were to parent a fool how
do you parent talks about Glory the only
solution to your child's addiction to
his own glory is to introduce him to a
greater glory in the Lord the world is
full of his glory which helps us help
them notice but you got to point it out
look at the sunset look at this
beautiful plant look at this animal
wisdom a fool needs wisdom so look for
wisdom moments the wisdom of a world
filled with people who live uh the fruit
of the spirit is obvious and so be a
Salesman for the wisdom of God's better
ways point out those Christians at
church and say look how they've done
look at that how good they're to go
they need story the story of the person
and the work of Jesus needs to be
repeated let them hear you teach it and
sing it and tell how it changed your
story so you need to be preaching Jesus
well they know that story preach it over
again tell me the old old story write on
my heart every word do it over and over
and over again you can't talk too much
about Jesus in your home you can't
praise him too much you can't talk too
much about God speak of him every way
and tell how it's affected you and what
you were before and what you are now
welcome tell them how God always invites
Us in to believe his story to turn from
all of our foolishness to confess him in
our foolish ways to bury that foolish
person in a watery grave to rise with
Christ in us and be forgiven Grace it
takes Grace to be God's tool and not
Satan's fool full of anger is the way
the world will leave you and foolish to
be mad about everything if you're a
hotthead young fella you need to get
over it before it kills you because it
can there are three areas as parents
dealing with the foolish principle but
work to present as God's tool over and
over and over from many angles we're
going to look at it three great truths
the foolish principle makes us realize
we struggle with so I'm just going to
show you real quickly three
areas that our young people struggle
with that it is your responsibility
parents to help them in this struggle
these are the three places their
foolishness will make them struggle with
receiving it but if you can get them to
receive this they're already well on
their way to maturity spiritual maturity
number
one a child's Foolish Heart will
struggle to receive reive the message of
the
Cross so I bring my kids to
church doesn't mean they're getting
it didn't mean they're getting it 1
Corinthians 1:18 for the message of the
Cross is foolishness to those who are
perishing but to us who are being saved
is power of God there's a difference
between saying I know the story and you
sing the songs and really believing that
Jesus died on the cross and that he
saves our souls by
that a lot of our young people will
struggle with that if not every single
one of
them they may still be struggling with
it and they will deny that they're
struggling with it some of you are
struggling with it some of you are not
certain you believe
it so yeah it's a struggle so it's your
job to get get that message inculcated
into their mind get them to fully
understand it how Jesus death on the
cross saves our soul and maybe you don't
understand it if you don't understand it
we'll be happy to study with you and
help you so that you can help your
children but ultimately if you don't
understand how his death on the cross
was essential then it's going to be hard
for you to explain it so that's number
one number
two a child's Foolish Heart will
struggle to receive the things of the
spirit
listen to 1 Corinthians chapter 2:14 but
the natural man does not receive the
things of the spirit of God when you're
not really spiritually minded you don't
receive it for they are foolishness to
him nor can he know them because they're
spiritually discerned quite
honestly don't even want to hear
spiritual
talk if you're really in the flesh young
people you don't even want to hear it I
know because I've been there didn't even
want to hear it don't even want to hear
another sermon don't ever don't even
want to hear somebody tell me something
spiritual don't even want to hear it and
certainly don't think you know something
I don't know spiritually speaking that's
a struggle that is a real struggle and
getting beyond that where they begin to
realize there is a spirit world that
there is a holy spirit getting beyond
that where they begin to realize that
and receive it and then want the Holy
Spirit that's a struggle and a lot of
times kids here's the thing so we have a
bunch of kids that'll grow up and then
they'll go away to college okay what's
going to happen some of them go to
Christian college and you think that'll
save them that won't save
them that won't do
it right now it's when they get
saved when you convince them of these
things you won't have to about if you
convince
them you say well what do you mean I'm
telling you they don't leave and leave
the church they were never
us and we don't want to hear that been
in many of our kids that never bought
into what we believe we just thought
they did and foolishness was bound up in
their heart and we thought they were in
it like Flynn with us and they were not
they just went alone because Mom and
Daddy were there
they were been made ago it never was
their passion the things of the spirit
was never their passion number
three a child's Foolish Heart will
struggle to receive the wisdom of the
Lord you see if you're really
smart you don't need to get wisdom
you're already smart so many of our kids
today have got
Google they know everything
I got Google what I need you
for and they don't realize how foolish
that
is number one just because it's on the
internet doesn't mean it's
true
otherwise I'm a French
model if anybody remembers that far back
y'all remember that
commercial no it's just not true so the
wisdom of the
Lord is something you got to tap into
and you got to pray about you got to ask
for you got to pray over your children
and ask God to give them wisdom but
listen to what it says for the wisdom of
this world is foolishness with God for
it is written it catches the wise in
their own craftiness so to God what
everybody thinks is so smart is foolish
talk Google it's foolishness Facebook
foolishness Tik Tock foolishness
99.99% of all that's on social media
foolishness most of you should get off
of
it most of you can't handle it and you
say things you shouldn't say and you
listen to too much of it you shouldn't
be listening to anyway because it's
foolishness it's just people talking and
people are crazy
but then they think the wisdom of God is
foolishness and they think the gospel is
foolishness so it's the the world sees
the message of the Cross as foolishness
they see the things of the spirit as
foolish they think the wisdom of God is
foolishness because hey I got a cell
phone and I can get on Google if I've
got a question I'll look that up what I
need to go to church
for you may you may not believe what I'm
saying but I'm telling you this is so
close to being spot on to every one of
us here it's not even
funny uh how much suffering and tragedy
could we avoid if we could quit having
so many foolish
thoughts if our heart wasn't so
foolish remember I talked to you this
morning the crowd that came this morning
about John Moore M
Ohr so he wrote that song and I poem
Find Us Faithful somewhere in between
1988 and 1989
uh but he wrote it the reason I said
that and I think it's important for you
to hear the rest of the story he wrote
it after several years now listen to me
years of marital
unfaithfulness and deceit I'm not
talking about he messed up one
time he was living in it and the people
around him who were supposedly
Christians you know that kind of
Christian knew what he was doing
multiple Christian friends tried to
convince him to confess
it and he wouldn't but he finally
somebody convinced him to completely and
brutally straightforward confess it to
his wife now I want to tell you
something I have run into Christians
Christians faithful Christian before I
tell the rest of the story I have run
into faithful Christians who said to me
if they were having an affair
and they quit
it they would not tell their
mate why would you hurt
them
wrong if you're going to repent you got
to
confess
wrong and I know bound to be somebody in
here that did just what I
said quit it and they never found out
in order to make life right you got to
be
brutal because the other person deserves
the
truth he describes his wife Luan and how
this went this was
brutal he describes his wife luanne's
forgiveness is nothing short of
miraculous analgous to what he reflects
upon is true true for all those confess
and Trust God's leading that freedom is
reward unless you have that you never
get that you don't get that freedom
feeling you never get
it in the wake of this realization he
composed Find Us Faithful now you
understand that Ser that poem at the end
find is
faithful he wrote that after he realized
he had to do this and he confessed to
his wife it's probably because he
already knew his children kind of knew
what was going on he knew his children
needed to know he was turning over and
going to become a different man
and it's
difficult his voice before this was in
thousands of commercials you don't
realize this but you've heard
commercials with John Moore's voice on
it he's been in versions of the Bible
you didn't know that cuz he they keep
that usually silent he's been in
versions of the Bible you probably get
he used to tour with the Gaither Vocal
Band if you know who they are and he was
backup singer for many so-called gospel
singing groups he lived in the Ukraine
you ever heard of the Ukraine he lived
in Ukraine with his wife and with his
family working with hospitals and
orphanages with Lan and their six
kids but he had to come
clean now Steve Green uh about the time
this was all happening and after he
finished this find his faithful he had
done several songs with John Moore and
he did Steve Green did a thing called
the mission and John Moore wrote this
particular one that I want to share with
you now when right as he's coming out of
his unfaithfulness
okay and and the reason I'm bringing
this up is
because at some point
you got to get rid of that foolishness
in your heart and quit justifying your
sin here it goes you may recognize the
beginning of
this oh be careful little eyes what you
see oh be careful little eyes what you
see for the father up above is looking
down in love oh be careful little eyes
what you said did you know he wrote that
no no he didn't write that but it's part
of the song wa second then he goes on
what
appears to be a harmless
glance can turn to
romance and homes are
divided feelings that should never have
been awakened
within tearing the heart into two listen
I beg of you guard your heart
guard your heart don't trade it for
Treasure don't give it
away guard your heart guard your heart
as a payment for pleasure it is a high
price to pay for a soul that remains
sincere with a conscience
clear guard your heart
heart the human heart is easily swayed
oh John knows this the human heart is
easily swayed and often Betrayed at the
hand of emotion you dare not leave the
outcome to chance you must choose in
advance right now listen to me young
people don't you ever commit adultery
don't you ever become unfaithful to your
mate they may run around on you they may
run off on don't you do it don't you do
it you dare not leave the outcome to
chance make a decision right now you
dare not leave the outcome to chance you
must choose in advance like right now or
live with the agony such needless
tragedy guard your heart why because
it's foolish guard your heart why
because I've got a fool in
there don't trade it for Treasure don't
give it away guard your heart you're the
only one that can guard your heart as a
payment for pleasure it is a high price
to pay for the soul that remains
sincere for the conscience
clear guard your
heart Paul David trip put it this way
the foolishness inside your children is
more dangerous to them than the
Temptation outside of them you see you
don't have an affair because some body
tricks you into
it you don't have an affair
accidentally you don't do foolishness
accidentally it's in your heart
already it's already
there back up the foolishness inside
your children is more dangerous to them
than the Temptation outside of them only
God's grace has the power to rescue
fools that's why we must teach these
things we talked about tonight they have
to understand let me call you away from
being a fool and living in
foolishness we all start out as totally
foolish in heart it's not something some
of us have the problem with but we can
be
changed we can stop the foolishness so
we can come to the message of the cross
and embrace it we can come to the things
of the spirit and understand it and we
can come to the wisdom of the Lord and
be
wise and the place to begin is to hear
believe repent confess be baptized of
course
but you got to make a
decision and your mama and your daddy
can't make it for you young
people and parents listen to me you
can't fix this
you can only lead them to the
water they have to drink
