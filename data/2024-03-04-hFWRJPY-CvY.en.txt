if I wrote a
book I guess you call that and titled it
disappointment and I filled it with
300 pages but nothing was written on any
of the pages if you purchase that book
would the theme of disappointment be
yours disappointment is when you expect
something sometimes and you it doesn't
happen uh there's been a lot of history
of perfect
leaders disappointing
us we have seen that many many times
people we thought were going to be
perfect we were following maybe but they
disappointed us how many times have we
say picked presidents or Governors or
judges or even County Sheriffs Church
Elders uh preachers and were
disappointed by it and I'm I must say at
this point I'm sorry if I'm a
disappointment to
you I I me I mean that I'm a
disappointment often to me Fallen
Shepherds and Scattered sheep is um a
book that was written by elf leard
Smith um in
1988 he talked about many situations
like like that within
Ministry I've seen some ministers
accused of
murder
adultery
fraud
plagiarism
embezzling
homosexuality among them are names you
would know Jim Baker Jimmy swager Matt
Chandler Mark Driscoll Bill
hble TD Jakes of recent has been accused
Jimmy Swagger
uh and then of course there's Carl Lind
there's others also that been accused of
things that are not in those Realms of
moral failures but of false teaching
among them recently Andy Stanley Joel
ostein Alistair begs those are names you
may know may not
know but what's interesting is there
have been a lot of history of so-called
perfect leaders that were're less than
perfect
H what's interesting to me is how good
Saul looked on
paper Saul looked really good on paper
have you ever noticed it have you ever
studied it here are 12 reasons he looked
like the perfect King the perfect not a
good King a great king let's walk he
thre them without I'm not going to go
into great detail there're too many he
was handsome who doesn't want somebody
up here that looks so good
right that was a joke but anyway he says
in verse two of 1st Samuel 9 and he had
a choice and handsome son whose name was
Saul and they even said there's not
anybody more handsome than him now y'all
can say you don't care about such things
as that but we don't really
one of the reasons we're not too happy
with either of the two running for pres
is they're both ugly and
so first that's the
truth you you say you don't feel that
way you women you you pay attention to
what men look like by the way we pay
attention to what women look like too
just just let you know that fact that's
the first thing I noticed about somebody
when people walk up I I don't notice
your color I notice whether you're a man
or a woman that's the first thing I
notice
that's and I pay attention if it's a
woman and then if it's a man I just
ignore him all right 1 Samuel 9: 16 says
tomorrow about this time I will send you
a man from the land of Benjamin and you
shall anoint him Commander Over My
People Israel and he's going to do a
great job that's that was the Lord's
word to he's like a commander he was
humble uh 1st Samuel 9:21 and Samuel
answered and said am I not a benjamite
of the small as to the tribes of Israel
my family the least of all I'm not the
guy he was anointed verse uh one of 1st
Samuel 10 the Lord has anointed you
Commander over his inheritance he poured
the all on him he was the one God chose
God not just Saul Saul being appointed
by Samuel he was the one God
chose in verse 11 of 1st Samuel 10 he
appeared to be inspired of the Lord it
says uh when all who knew him formerly
saw that he indeed prophesied among the
prophets they say is he a prophet now
and in fact he was inspired in verse 24
of 1 Samuel 10 he was chosen to the Lord
says do you see him whom the Lord has
chosen that there is no one like you
among among the people of course that's
referring partly to his height because
he was taller than all the men and by
the way all you ladies notice when some
guy is taller too you can say you don't
as a man of great height I've noticed
that you pay attention to it and it's
natural to do it like the height like
the tall in 1 Samuel 11 and verse 6 it
says then the spirit of God Came Upon
Saul when he heard this news and his
anger was greatly aroused so he was a
man of zeal he heard things and that
were bad news and he was going to take
care of it for Israel he was a merciful
man because it says in 1st Samuel 11
they they were going to deal with the
people who are against him becoming King
and in verse 13 Saul said not a man
shall be put to death this day for today
the Lord has accomplished salvation to
Israel we're not going to do that we're
going to be merciful to those people who
hate me and then he was a sincere Man 1
Samuel 13 we just read it verse 8 says
then he waited seven days according to
the time set by Samuel Samuel you set
this up you're going to offer the
sacrifice in seven days and then we're
going to gather the people we're going
to go out to battle Samuel did not show
at gilgal and the people were scattered
from him and he's like I got to do
something in fact down in verse 12 it
says the Philistines will now come down
on me a Gil gallon and I have not made
supplication to the Lord therefore I
felt compelled and offered burnt
offerings he was an impartial guy I show
you how impartial he was in 1 Samuel 14
and: 44 it says Saul answered and said
God do so and more also for you shall
surely die Jonathan my son I'm going to
kill my own son because he did not keep
the oath that I made to all of you and
he was not supposed to eat during that
battle and he had some honey you
remember that battle he was going to
kill his own son that's how sincere he
was he was courageous in 1 Sam 14:48
says he gathered an army and attacked
amalekites and delivered Israel from the
hands of those who plundered them he is
not afraid to go into battle he is
courageous and he was likable in 1st
Samuel 15 and verse1 15 it says and Saul
said they talking about the people
remember they have attacked AAG and his
people they have brought them from the
malachit for the people spared the
people spared the best of the sheep and
The Oxen to sacrifice to the Lord he
just did what the people wanted done he
says he's
likable now that wasn't the will of God
that's not my point he was likable look
at all the
qualities looks like you're perfect
candidate doesn't it looks like the guy
you would vote for looks like the guy
you would want leading your country look
at
that you can be honest for a moment it
looks good doesn't it
yet Saul is
rejected and
replaced in his second
year just getting into his second year
of 40 years he's told you're not the man
your kids will not Reign after you this
is
it there's a lot to learn from all of
this but what seems to be the three
predominant messages are not cohesive
but we're going to go through them okay
they're not really cohesive they're not
really about the same thing but I want
us to walk through them I want you to
focus and think and listen closely
because there's a lot for us in this
other than
that
okay number one Saul's Disobedience was
rejected and replaced it says in 1st
Samuel 16 now the Lord said to SA
how long will you mourn for Saul I said
solom and Samuel how long will you mourn
for Saul seeing I have rejected him from
reigning over Israel fill your horn with
oil and go I'm sending you to Jesse the
bethlehemite for I have provided myself
a king among his sons and as you know
that was
David those
rejecting the orders to take Canaan do
you remember that back
numbers those rejecting the orders to
take Canaan
land were
rejected and they were replaced with the
Next
Generation you remember
that hosea's
wife rejected her husband but she
returned and was faithful so a later
generation would return that was the
message it says say so in Hosea 3 and: 5
afterward after this rejection of God
afterward the children of Israel shall
return and seek the Lord and they that
is the next Generation shall fear the
lord and his goodness in the latter
days listen
closely if we are a disobedient
church we members of this church will be
rejected and a future obedient church
will replace us it's true for
me as your
preacher
disobedient God doesn't have a problem
rejecting me and replacing me Saul's
path to being rejected and replaced
shows us how it was his
Disobedience that was
rejected and replac with an obedient
one that's a lesson we need to
learn number
two Saul's appearance was
rejected and replaced now that's the
message you don't get very clearly
often but he looked apart right it says
in verse 7 of 1st Samuel 16 but the Lord
said to Samuel do not look at his now
he's he's in the house of Jesse looking
at his voice by the way he had to hide
what he was doing there because if Saul
had found out he' come and kill Samuel
and he' kill the house of Jesse probably
but the Lord said to Samuel do not look
at his appearance or at the height of
his stature because I have refused him
he's talking about one of the brothers
of David for the Lord does not see as
man sees for man looks at the outward
appearance but the Lord looks at the
heart
there was a face painted lady called
Jezebel in 2 Kings 9:30 she doled
herself up for when ju came back from
the battle and she was rejected while
she was thrown out of the window by uh
some Unix and she fell so far down that
killed her and then the dogs came and
ate her and all that was left were her
feet in her hands she was
rejected here's the thing is that
that face
painting that making beautiful can be
replaced with something
bloody like
Jesus What was seen is beautiful is now
rejected and ugly nobody thinks what
Jezebel looked
like really was beautiful in fact you
can face paint so much ladies that it
scares us and replaced with what seen as
ugly at first but now is seen as
beautiful Revelation 9:13 let me get to
it Revelation 9:13 he that is Jesus
Christ was clothed with the robe dipped
in Blood and his name is called the word
of God what was once thought to be ugly
a cross what was once thought to be ugly
was this blood dripping off of his robe
that he surrounded himself with and be
beauti F to
us if we and here's the message stay
with
me if we are a
beautiful
worldly face painted church that
everybody of the world thinks is
gorgeous we might well be
rejected and yet a
future
ugly bloody looking cross bearing cross
centered Church would replace
us you see
the if you're not godly if you're not
Christlike me
included you can be
rejected and you can be
replaced and so many will
be Saul's path to being rejected and
replaced shows us how it was his
appearance that ended up was
rejected and replaced with a
David wasn't much to him and looks
interesting isn't it how that can
happen number next or last
really Saul's presence was departed and
replaced now we're talking about his
Spirit you remember he had the spirit of
uh a prophet remember the Spirit came on
him he was changed he became a different
man he had the spirit of God he
prophesied he was inspired of
God verse 14 of 1 Samuel 16 but the
spirit of the Lord departed from Saul
that can't happen well it
did departed from Saul I'm not saying
Saul was lost that's not the point of
this but the spirit of the Lord departed
from Saul
and a distressing spirit from the Lord
troubled
him
what those who have lost the
presence the presence of the Lord the
presence of the
spirit have not always known it they
didn't even know it had
happened judges
16:20 Samson's case in point he didn't
know the spirit had departed from him
others see when the presence departs
though they see you you may not know if
the spirit has departed from you but
others know I'm not saying you're lost
I'm just saying that the spirit of God
is Not ruling in your life and people
can see it on you they can see it on
your face they can see it on your
behavior they can see on what you do
that spirit of God is Not ruling your
life they can see it you may not think
they can but they can see it and when
the spirit departs there's a CH change
in spirit and the spirit that comes is a
troubling Spirit Jude 1 verse 19 uh this
person causes divisions why not having
the spirit you ever seen anybody that's
divisive at church anybody causing
trouble in the church anybody that's
just wants to be in the middle of a
fight every time there's a fight wants
to pull off their shoes and hit you in
the head with one of
them don't look at me funny you've seen
it causing division having not the
spirit but they don't know that I'm not
claiming their loss I'm just telling you
straight up they're not what they were
Luke 11: 26 and the last day of them is
worse than the
beginning it would almost been better
for them not to have had the spirit than
to have the spirit and then lose it is't
that right so if we back now our lesson
if we are seen as a great and growing
church but the spirit depart
and we're without the
spirit and I'll tell you that I believe
a future
church I don't know when if that were to
ever happen would replace our
distressing spirit and a better
Spirit than us or me would show up I
believe that's what God does Saul's path
to being rejected and replaced shows how
it was the spirit presence that departed
and was replaced with the distressing
spirit now let me see if I can draw this
to some kind of conclusion that makes
some sense to you if you're not
following where I'm going with all this
the
replacement is often better than the
original the house of Eli was the priest
family and they were
rejected and replaced with the house of
zadok 1 Samuel 2:30 says I say your
house would walk before me
forever it's What God Says to Eli far be
it from me though those who despise me
shall be lightly esteemed it won't work
that way in 1 Chronicles 16:39 the house
of zadok took the
priesthood that's why they're called
zadok sees or
Sadducees
Saul looked like the perfect
King and then Jonathan would have been
the next in line but he is replaced by
little boy
David their greatest
King 1st Samuel 15:28 says Samuel said
the Lord has torn the Kingdom from you
and given it to a neighbor of yours who
is better than
you that's quite a statement is't
it so the replacement is often better
than the
original Moses was a military leader in
Egypt and he led the people out and he
led them for 40 years but he was
replaced by Joshua who actually
conquered
Canaan Elijah did eight
Miracles but he was replaced by Elisha
who did 16
Miracles Judah stole from the apostles
but he was replaced by a man named
methas Acts chapter
one John did no Miracles but he was a
great preacher of the Gospel but he was
replaced by someone called Jesus and
John was right when he said in John 3
and verse 30 he must increase but I must
decrease Israel was God's
Nation but it was replaced by the
abrahamic kingdom which you and I are a
part of now you know the replacement is
often better than the
original My Time draws
now let's pray God gives you a far far
better preacher than I've been my time
is coming now I'm trying to prepare you
for that that's coming so look forward
and you're going to have a hard time
finding one better looking
but especially I don't know if you find
one
taller the replacement is often better
than the
original now that's not the lesson I'm
teaching today stick with me just a
second because this is really the lesson
I'm teaching today we are the original
Sinners replaced at The Cross by one far
far
better some are replaced others in an
instant of Courage just an instant of
Courage Los Alamos back in May of 1946
they were conducting experiments for the
atomic
bomb they had
u235 uh in a chain reaction the guy
leading this particular study was trying
to find the loads uh the exact ratio of
what would draw a critical reaction and
they had two pieces of u230 well u235
that they were using and what he was
keeping the two hemispheres apart with
was a screwdriver this sounds like
really high Tex St was
1945 his name was lwis slotton was a
young man and it separated they're doing
the measurements calculating so they can
figure out how much of a load they need
to make the bomb go off right and how
big the bomb will be when they do that
but his screwdriver slipped slipped out
from between them and therefore there
was no way to separate them and they
came together
instantly when they came together a blue
light hit the room flash of light that
blinded nearly everybody in the room he
knew instantly what it was in a moment
of Courage he reached down grabbed the
two halves and slung them
apart that quick this see how powerful
this stuff is folks that
quick he did the calculations when he's
laying out in the ambulance which was
called immediately he's laying on the
cot being taken away he speaking to the
seven other men who are in the room with
him he says you seven you will
survive you'll come through it all right
but I haven't the faintest chance to
survive nine days later he died in agony
but in a moment he did exactly the right
thing there are those who will give
their lives for others and they'll
replace others and in a moment I have to
say I kind of like what he did
right being willing to take their
place some have replaced others in an
hour of love you may remember the
history of England you'll notice in the
17th century Oliver cruml was a lord
protectorate of England you may not know
what that is if you haven't studied a
lot of English History but it was his
job to deal with criminals among other
things and he sented one criminal to be
shot for his
crimes
his execution was to take place at the
evening at the ringing of the curfew
Bell soon as the bell would ring they
would kill this young man was time for
the Bell to ring the bell didn't ring
wait a little bit longer the Bell didn't
rain and so Oliver carel says go find
out what's going on with the Bell they
didn't kill him yet they go to the bell
and find his fiance she had fixed
herself to the clanger of the bell and
she was blooded and beaten because they
had jerked it and jerked it and she let
her body
take the
pain she wept as she showed her bruises
and bleeding hands to
cromin crl said your lovers shall live
because of your
sacrifice curfew Bell shall not not ring
tonight our
replacement is often better than the
original our replacement before the
foundation of the world
before
before the world
was I'll
go I'll
go I'll give my
life I'll replace them that you have
reject and I'll go to that
cross the replacement is definitely
better than the original
amen he's taking your place Saul learned
it the hard way Les appreciate what's
been done for us through Christ I don't
know if we can but if there are
moments in our worship there are moments
in the middle of a song or in the middle
of the prayer
are in the middle of communion there are
moments when we actually
worship
