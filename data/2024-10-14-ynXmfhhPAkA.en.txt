well that was an interesting
week um morning everyone if you're new
to us today we welcome you we are Creek
Side uh I'm just glad to see you all uh
I'm just glad to
see that we're
alive um that was a tough
week and I've seen sadness I've seen Joy
I've seen houses unscathed and I've seen
houses torn apart and damaged and we've
had people and members here that have
had damage to their
property uh I know there were seven
births at the Tampa Hospital during the
storm so we've seen life we've seen
death uh my father-in-law and I we uh
waited through the floods there trying
to help and we saw animals dead and
floating and trying to help and we've
seen horrible things and we've seen
amazing things and
I don't know how to explain
it and I know at times like these we
look to to leaders or or maybe spiritual
leaders and for an
answer I I don't know I have no idea the
truth is I have no clue and I love
reading the scriptures and I love trying
to understand what God's doing and the
more I read the more I realize I have no
idea and I'm humbled by that
and at the same time there's a peace
there we've had people really suffering
we uh yesterday I want to first thank
you uh to those who came out and helped
yesterday we were helping the community
uh things escalated out of I don't even
know how to explain it but we were
sending meals into the flooded areas uh
there are people who lost their homes
that are outside that uh we've invited
them in we've had people that are are
camping all around us right now that
haven't had showers that don't have
clean clothes that have literally lost
their houses and so we want to try and
help them as Creekside but I want to
thank those who did come up and did help
out thank you guys I know it got crazy
but thank you thank you thank you I
don't want to mention you by name
because there's a special reward in
heaven for you and if I say your name I
take it away and I don't want to do that
to
you but thank
you so 2019 I decided to come for a a in
this
country and I didn't intend on staying I
did not want to
stay I didn't intend to be
here but then a lovely lady caught my
eye and I like to say she she asked me
does this napkin smell like chloroform
to you and then I woke up and I was
married
right but it kind of felt like
that I didn't want to stay in America I
know some of you thought I was just
trying to get a green card no I know
America's great I love it but it's not
that amazing I'm I'm not desperate to be
here but I find myself here with a a
wonderful
wife um who is so good that I was
willing to give up my country my culture
my everything because she's worth it and
now we have a
child and now I'm in the middle of a
hurricane and I'm thinking to myself
what in the world do we do here because
I grew up in a country where we didn't
have to deal with this kind of stuff so
now I'm trying to navigate how do I
explain this to my friends and family
who are texting me like crazy from
around the world like dude what's going
on and I'm like we're boarding up
Windows I didn't even know how to do
that but I'm going to figure it out and
so i'vegot to go to my next door
neighbor I'm like Kevin I love the guy
he's he's crazy but I'm like Kevin you
got to help me he yep we got you and and
thank the Lord for people like
Dwight who burst into my office about
four or five weeks before the storm bit
of an exaggeration but he says to me
well there's a storm coming like how do
you know that Dwight the Cockroaches are
coming inside I'm like of course you
would notice that you know Dwight's
sitting there like one 2 3 4 well
storm's
coming and so we're getting ready and
and Dwight knows and so I have to lean
on people who know about the storm
because I have no clue what to do and I
have this this young family and this
this one wonderful little
boy and I'm like how do I protect them
how do I as the man of the house make a
plan to protect these these these people
that I
love and so I'm going around asking you
know I need help I need help and I'm
trying to explain to my parents and I'm
trying to tell my mother I'm trying to
balance her worries and her fears
because she doesn't understand but she's
got every solution Under the Sun for me
you know you know what it is I know what
to do yeah you're on the other side of
the planet
so the storm came on Wednesday
night and we lost power at 6m like most
of you
did and uh and I'm not going to lie I
might not have looked like I was scared
but I was scared I don't I'm not used to
this and at 6 p.m. when the wind started
to come
up and I had made this plan that you I'm
going to put my family in the middle of
the house in the the walk-in
closet right so I've taken everything
out I've put mattresses in there cuz in
my mind I'm like look at them away from
the
windows and uh yeah I'm a little bit
crazy I know even my wife is laughing at
me but at 9:00 we both were like uh it's
time to go into the closet so I've come
out of the closet lately
but so I got them in
there and you know Vic and Callum are
relaxing they're sleeping the dog's in
there too can't forget Bailey and I keep
going outside to look and you got your I
know I'm sure you all did it with your
flashlights and you're looking and I'm
looking at the tree like oh no what's
going to happen like I'm going to do
something about it you know I don't know
what I'm doing I'm confused I'm I'm I'm
a little bit what do I do and then I go
run to the front door and I'm like let's
check this tree and if it comes down
it's not like I'm going to jump in the
way right but I'm so worked up and now I
see a coming through now it's going to
be
flooding oh no now how do I deal with
this one so I try and venture out onto
my driveway to go see our retention Pond
and it's getting up there and it's too
windy I'm like what am I doing this is
dangerous and I'm back inside and I'm
worried just like you guys
were and I finally get to lie in the the
on the mattress in the wardrobe next to
my wife and child and
dog and
uh I got to sleep at a about
12:00 and I had convinced myself that
the storm was about to go we're almost
through and I'm sending text to my
mother hey don't worry we're almost
there we're almost there it's okay and I
convinced myself that somehow we were
going to be in the eye of the storm cuz
you know I was I wasn't getting good
celf
service and so I had this
hope and I fell asleep at 12:00 and I
woke up and it felt like I had slept for
hours and the wind had died down I'm
like oh thank you Lord we're through and
then the wind came again I was like oh I
no and I looked at my clock and it had
been 3
minutes you guys know what I'm talking
about it felt like an eternity I'm sure
you felt it as
well where my mind went while I was
lying on that mattress staring out the
cupboard
door what did Noah
experience this is where I want to take
this
today you have a
man who's found favor in God's
eyes and God is determined and it uses
the word determined to wipe everything
else out but he's going to save Noah and
his
family and and he gets him on the ark
well firstly no is a man of faith and
obedience I mean come on he buil that
Arc to the exact measurement obedience
to God faith that something was coming
that God was going to save him amazing
faith that took him straight into a
storm did our faith take us into the
storm and Noah is on the ark and God
opens up the floodgates beneath and the
rain's come down for 40 days and I can
imagine the winds blowing and imagine
being in that Ark and the creaking of
the ship and the howling winds and the
rain hitting the the the ark and the
Animals
uneasy for 40 days how did he deal with
that I couldn't bear 3
minutes I'm there for three minutes
going oh my goodness Noah
how and so I'm wondering did did our
faith bring us into the
storm and then you carry on reading in
chapter
8 and it says you know once you Noah
built an altar to God and he offered his
best that he had to God after the
storm his first thing he did was focused
on
God and if you read just the verse
before he says he got off the ark the
very next verse is and he he built an
altar to God the first thing he did was
turn his eyes to God
did we do
that when the storm passed did we say
God thank you so much for delivering us
and thanks to Noah for what he did
because we can trace our lineage all the
way back to Shem ham and Jaffer those
are Noah's sons so we have Noah G DNA
inside of us I guess we're there and for
Noah to do what he did and this Covenant
was made with God that the ground would
not be cursed anymore we benefited from
that
storm how crazy is that the storm that
engulfed the
world somehow we find a gift out of
that so I get out of the the closet and
I I go and check again hey tree what are
we doing hey tree what are we doing and
I look at the flood that potentially
could come to the house and I manag to
calm myself down again get back to the
walk-in closet and I lie down again and
it must be about 12:30 now and I start
to think what about
Jonah oh
Jonah what a rebellious individual God
says Jonah I need you to go to Nineveh I
need you to go to the enemy of your
people and go and tell them the good
news and and and tell them that you know
they need to repent and that they'll be
saved and Jonah's like no ways that's
like me saying to Americans hey go to
your
enemy and uh and and and make things
right and so off you go to Washington no
I'm kidding I'm kidding I'm
kidding you go to your worst enemy right
I'm going to have men in suits at my
door
um but who wants to do that and so Noah
in his Rebellion now finds himself in a
storm so much so that the sailors who
were with him were terrified these
hardened Sailors what
terrified hat how big the storm
is so I wonder is it our
Rebellion that's led us into the
storm I'm confused at this point is it
my faith is it our rebellion and I'm
really worried about that
one has America rebelled against
God and I'm not talking about just the
hurricane that's come through but we're
in some political social economic storm
right now now we all know
it is it because of our
Rebellion
H or have we been
faithful but what I do know is in
Chapter 2 of uh
Jonah comes to his
senses he comes to his senses and he
repents there's a repentance In
Jonah uh verse 7 in chapter 2 when my
life was faint fainting away I
remembered the Lord and my prayer came
to you into your Holy
Temple when I was fainting
away those who pay regard to Vain Idols
forsake their hope of steadfast
love but I with a voice of Thanksgiving
will sacrifice to
you what I have vowed I will repay
salvation belongs to the Lord
amen I wonder if we've rebelled I wonder
if we need to
repent as a
nation you know often I
see we shy away from from issues that
are deemed political CU oh we don't want
to be political but they're biblical
moral issues and we as a church haven't
really stood up and said anything we've
shied away and I wonder if our Rebellion
or if our our our our turning a Blind
Eye Has led us into the storm maybe we
need to repent but then my brain goes a
little bit further maybe it's not just
America maybe maybe Florida is the one
that's caused the
problem or maybe it's the people of
verico well you know what maybe
everything we're experiencing right now
is because of Creek Side Church of
Christ let's take it further maybe it's
me
because in these stories I see Jonah an
individual bring Calamity on people
around him because of his
Rebellion maybe it's I'm the one who
needs to
repent and make right with
God and I don't just mean repentance I
mean get on your in fact don't even get
on your knees get on your face put a
cover of your head because we're not
worthy to be in front of God repent to
him
my brain then went to um Psalm 107 as we
were uh talking about this one Psalm 107
is interesting the whole chapter is very
very
interesting and uh it really talks about
how God gathers people from the north
the South the East and the west and and
and through the the different paragraphs
some wanded in the desert Wast finding
no way for a city to dwell in uh the
next paragraph some sat in darkness and
in the shadow of death prisoners in
Affliction and in irons some were fools
through their sinful ways and because of
their iniquities they suffered
Affliction and the one we read some went
down in the to the Sea and ships doing
business on the Great
Waters um all these paragraphs lead to
people recognizing that God is the
almighty power in these storms of their
life and it leads to them in Repentance
to God and not only that I find a common
theme
let them thank the Lord for his
steadfast love next paragraph verse 15
let them thank the Lord for their
steadfast love next one 21 let them
thank the Lord for their steadfast love
again the 32 uh sorry uh 31 let them
thank the Lord for their stead for his
steadfast
love and the chapter finishes with them
saying uh with the writer talking about
how God can turn the rivers into a
desert a fruitful land into a salty
waste because of the evil of its
inhabitants well that might be
us but then he also goes into another
paragraph that says when they are
diminished and brought low through
oppression evil and sorrow he pours
contempt on
Princes maybe the storm that we're
facing is God restoring us because of
our leadership or maybe it's because of
the evil inhabitants I'm not sure but
what I do know is at the there whoever
is wise let him attend to these things
let them consider the steadfast love of
the
Lord and I'm lying in the bed there and
I'm thinking now about Jesus Matthew
8 when his disciples followed him onto
the boat we all know the
story and the storms raged and the
waters rose up the waters were going to
swallow the ship and they were
terrified and he's
asleep Lord save
us and Jesus says oh ye of little
faith and then Jesus turns to the storm
that is terrifying everyone and I think
about the hurricane that we just went
through and he rebukes it and it
stops
whoa how many of us wanted to do that on
Wednesday and
Thursday stop
imagine if it had
worked but for us we'd be praying to God
please please stop this for Jesus he
just rebukes
it now if I saw a man do that I'd be
paying attention
yes so I see in this story not
necessarily us turning Focus completely
God but but something bigger our
position in this whole thing humble
ourselves
to realize I cannot do that what God
just did
wow that's
amazing so my focus turns back to God
God you are
everything and the final story I guess
it must have been like 1 or 2:00 in the
morning now my brain's still racing and
the winds are getting stronger and I'm
like
okay I went to
job and I'm thinking about job and I
know there wasn't a physical storm but
there was
a mental
spiritual storm that that job went
through he loses his family he loses his
possessions he loses his health how do
you explain that
one why would God let that
happen I don't know I don't understand
if I understood the complexities of
God well we wouldn't have to be here
right
I'm in awe of
him but what I do know about job is that
there's a restoration at the end God
restores job and funny enough after he
prays for his friends after he prays for
restoration for his friends for
forgiveness for his
friends there's a restoration for job
and I
wonder are we holding on to things that
we could let
go that we could evade these storms that
we could start restoring maybe it's time
to to forgive maybe it's time to pray
for others maybe it's time to focus on
other people rather than ourselves and
maybe God will restore us that
way I don't
know but through all these stories I see
a common theme God is there if you want
to talk about probabilities it's 100% at
the
time and his steadfast love is
there and that's what I Look to and and
I know one day we will be in heaven
together and I I I'm willing to bet my
soul on this that we will be there and
we will say oh wow what a wonderful God
the way you did it oh that's why that
needed to happen and we'll Rejoice with
him we'll have joy we'll have peace
we'll have
happiness you ever seen the movie
Collateral Beauty some of you may
have out of suffering and this
turmoil there are these gifts of
collateral
Beauty where we get to see the human
Spirit rise up in ways we don't often
see and uh if you pay attention you'll
see some amazing things
church yesterday we had the the
privilege of seeing some of those things
we
uh we had people coming out of nowhere
to give food we had a family I don't
even know their name who showed up with
a truck and a Trailer Load I thought it
was a business delivering Goods it was
just a family who wanted to help
thousands of bucks that came from
them wow I would not have seen that if
we hadn't been through a
storm I saw people
canoeing
uh they were stuck in their homes they
got people there they're trying to help
they canoed up the river they walked up
to the church cuz they heard we were
here helping
out and uh yeah people are crying and
and people are
struggling but there's a place of Refuge
there's people trying to help we see
these wonderful beautiful things coming
out of this and I just I pray that we
keep looking for those things and not
focus on the bad and not focus on the
sadness let's focus on god let's focus
on repenting to him let's focus on
helping each other let's focus on on
forgiving one another let's focus on uh
sharing Christ with these people we got
to share Christ with so many people
yesterday it was
awesome one day we'll be with him we'll
understand but for now we
endure we thank him for bringing us
through
this and
uh church if you need Christ if one of
you needs him
if you want to be part of that
celebration now is the time the
invitation is you come forward we will
baptize we have a baptism
ready come forward as we stand as we
sing
