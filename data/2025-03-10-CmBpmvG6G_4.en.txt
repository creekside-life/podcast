there have been over 14,000 that watched
the lesson nine weeks ago on um how to
handle my money number
one uh in that we studied take a
monetary
inventory track meticulously your
expenses and try monthly budgeting I
mention that because that's what the
lesson's about today is
budgeting and then uh only a week ago
and a thousand people have watched that
so there must be some interest out there
on this subject more than just us and U
the lesson was again about how to handle
my money and in that we studied that we
should build up unnecessary savings with
a little bit of discernment that we
should pay off unnecessary debts with
great
determination and we should cut down
unnecessary spending with personal
discipline again we're on how to handle
my money and I want to talk to you just
a moment about a term you probably never
heard it's called tun
Olam
tun Al maybe you say it with me ton Al
try it again tun Al that's
Hebrew it's Jewish Hebrew Rabbi selo
kirken corn in his book secrets of
Jewish wealth revealed talks about this
so you'll understand why I call your
attention to and we'll bring you back to
tun
Al to be religious Jews he wrote we are
not supposed to isolate oursel on a
Mountaintop and meditate nor are we to
take vows of poverty rather we are
supposed to get out into the world
interact with it and Elevate the mundane
one of the great differences that set
Jews apart from other cultural groups is
that we see our wealth as a means to
partner with God as a way to bring God's
kingdom into this Earth a concept that
we call tun
Alam which means perfecting the world we
perfect the World by using our god-given
wealth to further God's realm on this
planet so what you see is that the
Jewish people pursuit of wealth is often
paired with the pursuit of charitable
works not only for selfish purposes thus
many Jews see wealth as a resource
because the term and what they pursue in
tun Alam which means
repairing the world now Christians tend
to seem to not understand the concept of
ton
alone churches often teach about money
and it swings from one extreme to the
other you will hear churches talk about
the doctrine of
scarcity and having a mindset of
scarcity that's one extreme The Other
Extreme in other words what I mean by
that is true Christians should be
poor The Other Extreme is the doctrine
of Prosperity Gospel that true
Christians should be
rich and you've heard those two extremes
to tun Al is not about either of those
so too often the Bible is used as a
hammer it's not used to
learn it's often used to
justify myself and to force on you my
ways so good preachers or at least what
we think are good preachers in the
church find scriptures to try to teach
you to give 10 20 30% of all that you
have bad preacher like
me find scripture to try to teach you to
give only maybe
10% and only of your
increase you don't hear that a lot in
the
church none of it if you're not if
you're in terrible debt you shouldn't
put a penny in the plate if you owe
people up to your eyeballs and can't
even make it to the end of the month you
should be paying them you owe it you
made a promise you need to keep keep it
until your debts are paid and you need
to start doing that lest the anger of
God fall upon you because you hold money
and the Cry of the worker out there will
cry up to the lord of the Sabbath and
you will be in trouble read the book of
James A Little
Closer Savers like to find their
scriptures to force or justify us all
being slightly
greedy Spenders like to find scripture
and force are justify them being
wasteful and being able to spend what
they want wherever they
want if you listen closely I'm not on
either of those
sides some Christians believe it's sin
to save and even IND damnable to be
wealthy Matthew chap
6: 19-
21 it reads like this do not lay up for
yourselves treasure me es on Earth where
moth and rust destroy and where thieves
break in and steal but lay up for
yourselves Treasures in Heaven where
neither moth nor rust destroys and where
thieves do not break in and steal for
where your treasure is there your heart
will be also there it is that's the
problem right
there you think you can have a treasure
on it
Earth really that's really not very good
theology the Rich Young Ruler in Matthew
chapter 19: 16- 21 says this Jesus said
to him if you want to be perfect
remember he's a rich young ruler of a
synagogue I don't know if you understand
the concept he was not the rabbi they
had a ruler of
synagogues okay they pretty much ran
things still that way to this day some
Churches have that inappropriately but
vers 21 Jesus said to him if you want to
be perfect go sell what you have and
give to the poor and you will have
treasure in heaven and come follow me
yes that man needed that and God knew he
needed that he it certainly though
doesn't have any application to me or at
least that's what the proud
say but it does you see just in case you
think the Rich Young Ruler was the only
one that was ever taught to sell all and
that that was just to him you need to
read your Bible a little closer have you
read
Luke 12: 33 and
34 who has said to you my
brethren and to me my
brethren let me read it
sell what you have and give on s let's
give to poor people provide yourself
money bags which do not grow old a
treasure in the heavens that does not
fail where no Thief approaches nor moth
destroys for where your treasure is
there your heart will be
also okay is that to all of us no it
couldn't be we couldn't do that well let
me explain to you I read Acts chapter 2
and verse 45 did you read that verse did
you read acts 4 and: 37 I read that
verse did you read Acts chapter 5 and
verse one I read that verse I read
Philippians chapter 3 and verse 8 did
you read those verses that's how the
early church interpreted it and they
went and sold their
stuff and gave it
away read your Bible
closer Luke 12: 16-2 I'll just I'll just
read verse 21 here's the difference so
that you can feel better about the pile
of money you might be sitting
on verse
21 lay up
Treasures a person who lays up treasure
and is not rich toward God if you're
rich toward God having a treasure is not
a problem you understand that
if it's a problem to you to give you
should probably give it all you say well
I don't believe anybody's ever done it
we've sold everything we've had twice
and I know Mel she be sold everything he
had four times don't tell me people
don't do
that so you do do it and you can do it
you just don't want to do it and I get
that because at some point you got to
figure out whether or not you're rich
toward God or not if you're not rich
toward God like the Rich Young ruler was
not it was time to sell
off get there now some Christians
believe it's a sin to not be rich now
that's that's the other end of the
spectrum some don't believe I mean if
you're not rich uh if you're rich toward
God so some Christians believe it's a
sin to not be rich if you're rich toward
God so for example let me give you on
that level um you ever heard of
Abraham the father of the faithful right
you know he's filthy rich right Filthy
Rich put you in the shadow there nobody
in this room that's even close to how
rich he was in his day you got 400 men
you can put on a on a horses to go out
to battle and you pay for them every day
and you feed them every day and that's
just part of what he
had uh he's got money all right you ever
heard of Joseph second most powerful man
in the world at the time
yeah Rich as he could
be Psalm 112 let's go back there Psalm
112 we read a moment ago Psalm 112 veres
1-3 praise the Lord blessed is the man
who fears the Lord who Delights greatly
in his commandments so we're talking
about someone Rich toward God verse two
his descendants will be Mighty on the
earth his children turn out pretty good
the generation the upright will be
blessed that's right that means not only
his children but his children children's
and children's children's children verse
three wealth and riches will be in his
house and his righteousness endures
forever so we who are supposedly Rich
toward God we are rich toward God when
when we are God's
treasure Deuteronomy 7:6 you are a holy
people to the Lord your God and the Lord
your God has ch chosen you to be a
people for himself a special treasure
above all the peoples of the face of the
Earth do you understand that's what you
are to God you are his special
treasure do you know that he looks at
you like a box of gold in heaven you are
his treasure and he finds his pleasure
in
you we're rich toward God when we are
God's treasure but we're also Rich
toward God when God is
our treasure see what's your number one
treasure is it your money or is it
God see that's when you begin to
know in Matthew 6 and verse 33 Jesus put
it very succinctly when he said seek
first the kingdom of God and his
righteousness and all these
things be added to you if you need it
you'll get it so you go down the line
Psalm
11962 what is it we should pursue what
is our treasure to us it's God's word
Isaiah 33:6 it should be reverenced
toward God and Matthew
12:35 he is our treasure it says in
Matthew 13: 44-45 and Matthew 13:52 we
sold all to have that treasure that
perfect Pearl in 2 Corinthians chapter 4
and verse 7 we we treasure his gospel
his gospel is the treasure within my
heart James 5: 1-6 we pay our debts 1
Timothy 6: 5-9 and: 17-19 we if we make
it to have any money we try to help
others otherwise the money means too
much to
us so as we try to be rich toward
God which will allow you to have money
and it not be
putrid we seek his kingdom
first so we need to learn to do that so
that we'll be rich and Rich toward God
we have to learn to budget
wisely using the Jewish principle of ton
Al repairing the world around me it's my
duty to do that so I look at three
principles quickly
here let me get to them get to the first
one did a lot of talking there didn't do
a lot of clicking number one wisely
budget with reserving money for
purchases now I'm going to tell you as a
young person no one ever talked to me
about
budgeting I knew nothing about
it got in a lot of
messes maybe some of you weren't taught
maybe your family didn't go by budget
budgeting is the wise thing to do if you
do not have a written budget go make
one Proverbs 10:5 he who gathered
in summer is a wise son so you gather
you get more than you need for the day
that's right he who gathers in summer is
a wise son he who sleeps in the Harvest
is a son who causes shame kids proverbs
10 verse5 he who gathers in the summer
is a wise man so wisely budgeting with
reserving money because you need to
reserve money for purchases you're not
going to live in this world without
being able to buy stuff you got if let's
say you raise cows you're going to have
to buy
wheat you got to buy other stuff you
you're G to have to buy eggs which cost
three children now
so nobody can afford
eggs I just love eggs we're we're eating
very few eggs now Proverbs
15:6 In The House of the righteous there
is much treasure but in the revenue of
the wicked is trouble so the righteous
are supposed to have much treasure so
I'm thinking that requires that I
actually reserve some of it for future
purchases that I'm going to have to
make so if we pay attention it is wise
to budget it is wise to budget reserving
money for purchases like sinking funds
for a house maybe that's amazing if you
could do that a car more than likely
some furniture or even just clothing at
Christmas time you ever budget for
Christmas you ever budget for your
vacation you ever budget for the things
you will want to make a purchase of
that's what it's talking about reserving
that money for those
purchases young people learn the concept
now you need to budget don't just spend
it all number
two wisely budget with risking money for
profits you can't make a profit in this
world without risk
somebody says well I don't believe you
ought to risk you got in your car and
came here this morning didn't
you are you telling me that's not a risk
especially on this road right out
here I can tell you about car wreck with
my car why don't we R of town proverbs
10 verse4 young people listen to me the
ones that are making notes for brother
Bob he who has a slack hand becomes poor
but the hand of the diligent makes rich
so what that means is you got to do
something if you're going to be better
off you got to work at it but to work at
it if you're going to take five talents
and turn them into 10 talents you took a
risk you can't do that in a bank and a
savings account it takes risk risk of
meeting people risk of trying to go into
a venture with them risk of whether or
not you could trust them risk of going
to a new job risk of trying something
else that you've never tried to sell
before it takes risk and the idea that
there's no risk that's the reason when
somebody says well I don't believe in
gambling because it involves risk I'm
like you got in your car I'm not for
advocating gambling don't get me wrong
I'm just saying there's no such thing as
any sort of making money without a
little risk there's risk on everything
you's risk on everything Proverbs 21:5
the plans of the diligent you have to
think about it though try to lower your
risk so you make good plans the plans of
the diligent lead surely to plenty so
you try to plan very carefully go to a
money planner talk to them they'll give
you good advice but those of everyone
who is Hasty surely to Poverty when you
hear John and you say oh that's a great
idea I'm going all in and you haven't
done your homework you haven't checked
up that's like investing in the stock
market when you haven't done any of the
reading of the papers about that company
you're just investing in that's Fool's
money so it is wise to budget and if you
going to budget wisely it involves
risking money for profits in investments
in stocks in business ventures and going
to a new job of giving up the old job
that's not paying enough to pay all your
bills it's time to go get another
job think on it Brethren the truth will
become clear to you number
three wisely
budget with reassuring money for
protection so after I've said that
that's you got to reserve some for
purchasing you got to risk some for
profits you need to have some money
that's reassuring to you for protection
you need to protect yourself the idea
that you don't need to protect yourself
you just need to trust God is Not wise
in any sense why would the Lord tell you
to put on the whole armor of
God if you didn't need to protect
yourself God's in to protect it he's got
them in Nehemiah he's they're using a
trial over here and a sword over here
while they're
work you need to protect yourself in
this world and anybody tells you oh you
just need to trust God and not worry
about it that's crazy there's nothing in
the Bible tells you to do that kind of
behavior there's nothing Proverbs 10:15
young people listen look at this one
Proverbs 10:15 uh Bob want to know the
rich man's wealth is in his Strong City
what's a strong City that's one with
walls around it the destruction of the
poor is their Pro poverty so a rich man
he's basically got walls built around
him do you remember how the devil
accused God because he had built a hedge
around job had a wall around himself
with the poor the destruction of the
poor is their poverty they've got
nothing to defend
themselves so we're not supposed to be
like that we're not supposed to just
expose oursel to any kind of disaster
that's just not correct
Proverbs 18 verses
1011 the name of the Lord is a strong
tower so one of the ways you protect
yourself okay is you're here you're
running to the Lord and just being
associated with the Lord has made you
safer you understand that right listen
now so the name of the Lord is a strong
tower the righteous run to it and are
safe the rich man's wealth is in his
Strong City and like high walls
in his own esteem so yeah you can depend
on your high walls and not run to the
Lord and that's a Fool's errand so the
idea that you can protect yourself
totally financially without going to the
Lord is also a Fool's errand you won't
get there he won't allow it listen to me
carefully you got to have both you got
to go for both and so it is wise to
budget it is wiser to budget really with
reassuring money for protection listen
to me gentlemen your wife will love you
if you got money in the bank he she will
love you if you've gone out of your way
to protect yourself protect your
position protect it so that there's
something to go back to listen to me how
do you do that there's a lot of ways you
can do it you can do it with insurance
insurance a great thing you could be
Insurance poor but insurance is a great
thing and it really does help when it
comes to health when it comes to keeping
your home if it catches on fire or
hurricane blows it away if they don't
claim it was because it was washed away
even though it was blown away and then
they won't pay you anything I'm telling
you there are some crooked Insurance out
there and then cars I mean paying for a
car and appliances all of those things
having Insurance on cars appliances
that's smart if you're in a Rec it's
actually against the law right to drive
your car around without insurance on
it so that's because it's so smart well
there's other security how else can you
be secure you could buy a
gun that's a security you can have a
safe in your house that's the security
you can put alarms in your house that's
the security those things are not
foolish those are wise things to do for
hurricanes you could have a generator
just don't put it in your living room
and turn it on you could have a
generator for a hurricane you can have
emergency supplies it's not a bad thing
I don't know if you need to be like
these Preppers and just have all kinds
of emergency priz and machine guns in
your back closet I'm just saying you
could PR prepare a little bit amen a
little bit's not a bad idea I'm just
listen to me carefully I'm not trying to
hurt you I'm trying to help you so here
here look this is what we studied over
the last few weeks pay attention this is
what we've looked at we've looked at
firstly take a monetary inventory be
meticulous and monthly budget okay that
was first lesson second lesson build up
some unnecessary savings uh pay off some
of your debts and then cut back on your
spending that was last week this week
look at it closely if you're wise you're
going to budget like we' already Tau now
how do you budget you need to reserve
some money for your purchases you need
to risk some money for your profits and
you need to have a little reassuring
money that goes to just protecting you
you need to spend some money that way
it won't fit everything but it'll help a
little bit does it really matter brother
duton if if I learn these principles I
tell you what I would have love for
somebody that set me down about 50 years
ago and taught me any of
this cuz I got none of
it I got none of
it does it really matter if I learn I
think it does
matter or or is this just another sermon
another way to get money out of y'all uh
this ain't about your giving
pay close attention this is not about
your giving it's about you doing what's
best for you okay and taking care of you
and we want you to be okay that's our
job to Shepherd you to protect you to
feed you to help you to be the best you
you can be I want to be the best me I
can be I want to be it for you I want to
be it for my wife I want to be it for my
children I want to be it for everybody I
want to be the best me I can be and I'm
not there I want to get there
so uh Financial tell of two s sisters
I'm not going to read this I I thought
about reading it but it takes like five
minutes to read it so I'll just tell it
and it'll take 10
uh so there's a family that uh business
family but they were good family they
good Christian family and and they had
two daughters one name these are not
their real names Melissa and one was
named Jane and and both of them were
taught that they needed to be careful
with their money they were taught to
budget they were taught to uh give 10%
of all that they ever make they were
taught to at least keep 10% of all they
ever make in a savings and someh outow
and that's how they should handle their
money and they need to be careful and
they needed to work hard and if you
don't work hard you won't make good
money and you won't be able to do well
you've got to work you got to excel
you've got to improve that's what they
were
taught well Melissa came along and she
was taught all this and she believed all
all this and so Melissa uh immediately
got a job early when she's young
babysitting some of you ladies have done
this so everything she made in
Babysitting she gave a tithe she gave
10% right of everything she ever got and
then she took a tenth of everything she
got and she put it back into savings and
then later she got a job and at that job
she did the same thing she she she gave
a tent to the Lord she kept a tent with
the rest of it the 80% the rest of it
boy she ripped through it she burned it
up she had fun as a teenager she went
out with all of her friends she went to
the park she went to the game places she
had fun she had a great time so when she
but because she saved like she did when
she got to the 12th grade and she was
graduating high school she had managed
even doing all that she had Save
$33,000 which probably means she'd given
at least $3,000 to the Lord right that's
what a great thing 18-year-old doing
that well Jan Jan who's raised the exact
same home exact same way T exactly the
same thing went and did exactly the same
thing just about as her older sister
Melissa so what she did is when she she
started babysitting at a pretty young
age and as she babysit she say I mean
she gave 10% the Lord but she saved
70% cuz she's living with her mom and
dad and then she got a regular job and
she gave 10% the Lord and she saved
70% and then with the 20% leftover she
enjoyed
that when she got to the end of the 12th
grade when she
graduated she had
$116,000 just a kid
not too bad not too shabby right for a
Kat now the person telling the story is
not
Jan the person telling the story is
Melissa and Melissa said writing about
this she said Jan continuing to be very
very good with her money but I've had to
learn to do better now that sounds so
good 10% to the Lord
10% to keep and blow the
rest most of us don't even do that
good and yet she realizes that she had
so she said I had to learn some smart
money
skills and I had to learn through some
Financial
hardships and so now she writes a little
blog if you want to check it out it's
called sweet Frugal life and he shares
how you can
budget and yet enjoy life so maybe we
don't have to spend
70% you get that just
listen maybe we need to be better at
budgeting and better at deciding what we
spend our money
on as your
preacher I want you to be rich toward
God first and
foremost seek first his kingdom and his
righteousness and I would also have you
to be
wise and to budget and to be
prosperous that you be ready to give to
help others that you would develop this
simple
Spirit to
Al I want to do all I can to fix this
world Amen
