Deja Vu god-shaped
ho spoke about this last
week so I want to reiterate a little
bit Alexander Pope he says we've Struck
from the hand the balance and the rod
we've
and become the god of God we read that
Jeremiah and Ecclesiastes tells us that
our hearts are wicked that we are trying
to fill some some void in us some hole
that we cannot truly
describe and in vain we
search and we fill it with
filth what a Wretched Man I
am what a wretched Wretched Man I am who
will save me from this body of
death thanks be to God who delivers us
through Jesus Christ Our Lord and so we
learned this last week we learned that
that filling this Gap or this hole
whatever this might be and we're going
to explore this a little bit more today
because it's a hole and so we must dig
right
yeah we learn to fill this with
Jesus someone who's so reliable we see I
gave you four points but there are many
points I could have talked about the
Four Points we we discussed was Jesus
being sinless he had amazing ethical
teachings he lived how he spoke and how
he taught and then he rose from the dead
and and showed us an eternal
pathway so I want to explore this a
little bit more today church this this
whole idea this this this Gap this
feeling Hebrews chap 10:9 if you want to
read with me at I know we just read a
verse there thank you Luke but I want to
expand on that Hebrews 10: 9-14 then he
said here I am I have come to do your
will he sets aside the first to
establish the
second by that we uh by that will we
have been
Sanctified through the offering of the
body of Jesus Christ once for all and
every priest stands ministering daily
and offering repeatedly the same
sacrifices with which can never take
away sins but this
man after he had offered one sacrifice
for sins forever sat down at the right
hand of
God from that time waiting till his
enemies are made his foot stol for by
one offering he has perfected forever
those who are being
Sanctified
great what does sanctifying mean I'm a
basic guy what does sanctified mean so I
dig into that word this week
Sanctified I'm going to try and
pronounce it I might not do it justice
hago
hago is the strongs in in 37 but the
definition is to make holy consecrate
sanctify to separate from Prof the the
profane things and dedicate to God to
purify to be being made
holy I love
that but what does holy
mean take a moment to think about that
word holy how would you describe that to
someone maybe in your mind you're
thinking well it's uh morally
good
okay how do you describe the Holiness of
God
have you ever thought about that how how
do you teach that to
someone and so once again I find myself
staring at the word not knowing how to
describe this to you not knowing how to
share this with
you so I read Exodus chapter
3 and I'm sure we've all know the story
of The Burning Bush Moses is confronted
with his burning bush we all know that
story it's Keegan okay okay he's
confronted with this holy Bush uh this
this um this Burning Bush and as he gets
closer and closer to it what does God
say stop do not come any closer for
where you are standing is Holy
Ground take off your
sandals that's
weird now I want to say to you the
ground's not
holy God has made the ground
holy this idea of God's
presence emanating Holiness around him
has made the ground
holy and this isn't a foreign idea to
Moses he's brought up as an Egyptian and
from what I could find the Egyptians
would take their shoes off when the
priests would go into the temple because
it's a confession or a profession that
they are
um this personal defilement they're
conscious of their unworthiness
to stand before the the undefiled the
unspotted
Holiness so Moses
response by taking his shoes off
right but also by hiding his
face a sign that he understood he was in
the presence of the glory of the Divine
majesty and was conscious of his own
sinfulness and
unworthiness in fact Moses was so aware
of God's holiness that he was afraid to
look at him so I've got this idea like
this
right what I see in in in Exodus is this
intensity of God's holiness that whoa
this is this is this is
burning somewhat
dangerous for us to enter into the
Holiness of God is
dangerous not because God Holiness is
bad but because it's
good and ultimately good absolutely pure
and what would Purity and goodness do to
a filthy Wretched Man like me we just
burn it up would burn me up so for me to
step into the presence of the almighty
his
Holiness is
immense so I I try to explore this de a
little bit more Leviticus 1 I find this
fascinating it says the Lord Called
Moses and spoke to him from the tent of
meeting numbers 1 ver1 the Lord spoke to
Moses
in the tent of
meeting
interesting between those two verses we
have
Leviticus a book that gives
steps and and uh laws on how we are
impure and how we are to take steps to
purify
ourselves now I find this interesting
now stay with me on this this is kind of
a an interesting
idea but in the Book of Leviticus we're
called to be ritually Pure
Clean we separate ourselves from Death
uh things like if we touch diseased skin
or a dead body or bodily fluids we were
considered
impure and for us to be in the presence
of God we would be
destroyed so how do we how do we make
that
right we have these steps on how to
become ritually ritually or ceremonially
pure and why is that interesting to
me I kind of see it like
this imagine Moses saying to God God we
want you to live with us come come live
with us come abide with us and I can
just imagine God going you don't know
what you're asking for yet
buddy my Holiness my presence will will
take you out because of who you've
become so if we're going to do this this
is how it needs to happen and so we have
the the temp the Tabernacle the most
holy of holies we all know the most holy
of holies where God
abides for us to go into the holy of
holies we need to be made Pure or
clean and so priests would do this and
only a certain person could go and do
this in fact they would tie a rope
around that person because if you
entered in and weren't in obedience to
God that'd have to drag you out
most holy of holies right so we've got
this idea that God's
holiness emanates from his Temple that
his people around him need to be
ceremonially cleaned constantly but this
idea that if I if I touched a dead body
I now become
impure keep that
imagery I've heard it likened to getting
closer to the Sun if we got closer to
the Sun if we get closer to God's
holiness we're just going to burn
up so I read in Isaiah chapter 6 woe to
uh actually let me read from verse
one in the year that King Isaiah died I
saw the Lord sitting on a throne high
and lifted up and the train of his robe
filled the temple above it stood
seraphim each one had six wings
with two he covered his face with two he
covered his feet and with two he
flew and one cried to another and said
holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the
whole earth is full of his
glory and the post sorry and the post of
the door was shaken by the voice of him
who cried out and the house was filled
with smoke so I
said woe to me now now Isaiah's reaction
isn't oh wow check it out it's it's
pretty bright it's cool his reaction is
whoa holy God whoo to
me for I am undone I am
ruined for I am a man of unclean lips
and I live among a people of unclean
lips and my eyes have seen the king the
Lord
Almighty then one of the seraphim flew
to me and a live coal in uh with a live
coal in his hand which he had taken with
tongs from the altar with it he touched
my mouth and said see this this has
touched your lips your guilt is taken
away and your sin is attone
for this idea that God's holiness I want
to emphasize this it's
intense it's powerful
there's a there's there's a lot of ways
to describe it but but there's a power
to it that I cannot grasp but I look at
these guys and I look at Moses like
whoa and Isaiah
whoa I am not worthy of
this so This coal comes down and touches
his
lips
interesting and he's he's made clear
he's uh your guilt is taken away and
your sin is atoned
for 800 years
later this has huge implications for us
800 years later we have Jesus going from
town to town and one day he's walking in
Matthew 9:20 and suddenly a woman who
had a flow of blood for 12 years came
from behind and touched the Hem of His
Garment for she said to herself if only
I may touch His Garment I shall be made
well
but Jesus turned around and when he saw
her he said be of good cheer daughter
your faith has made you well and the
woman was made well from that
hour what I read in Leviticus is that if
Jesus had touched a woman like this he
would be made
impure
unclean but we have this prophecy this
vision from Isaiah that's something's
changed and 800 years later a woman
touches His Garment and the opposite
happens she is made
clear wow that has huge implications for
us
church we are morally and spiritually
impure so what I see in Leviticus is a
physical representation of how messed up
we are and continue to be and so we are
morally and spiritually impure under the
law our Wicked Hearts have been found
wanting oh what a Wretched Man I am who
will save me from this body of death
thanks be to God through Jesus Christ
Our Lord as we read in Hebrews we have
now been Sanctified we have now been
made holy do you see the impli ations
here
church I can now boldly go Before the
Throne of
God I have been made
holy no longer do I have to be like
oh I Rejoice I am confident I can be
bold I have been given
everything so what we find with this
god-shaped
ho is that we try and fill it with this
filth and dirt and the mess of the
world and we truly when we truly humble
ourselves when we when we have God
sitting in the holy of holies in the
temple in that place where we so long
desire for something bigger than
ourselves we are filled with God's
holiness
and by that I am made
whole god-shaped whole w l
e we are made whole church because of
what Jesus has done for
us I put it to you that the Holiness of
God is in you there's something
immensely powerful living in
you do not take that for granted
I find it funny that our bodies are
described in Corinthians as the as a
temple for the Holy
Spirit like I say uh perhaps that
god-shaped
hole is where God belongs
right we feel the holy of holies crying
out for
us our souls long for more our souls
long for an everlasting relationship
with our loving
father it's almost as if he's put put
eternity on our
hearts so we find peace when our
god-shaped hole is filled with
god-shaped Holiness and we are made
god-shaped
whole and I had an interesting chat with
Shan last week and he brought the idea
to me
that there's still this longingness that
we
have and the term he used is God's word
longing because now that I know what
truly fills my soul what makes me whole
again I want more I want more and more
and more give me more Lord manifold
wisdom Ephesians talks about I want more
and
more and so you ask me Keegan why you so
enthusiastic why do you have joy and a
skipping your step because we have it
all we are made complete
I love
that this is a short lesson today Church
here's the
invitation I believe and you might
disagree with me but I believe that we
are a foreshadowing of what's to
come Ezekiel chapter
47 Ezekiel sees a river flowing from the
temple of
God and as he goes down it gets bigger
and deeper and bigger and deeper and and
it's sustaining life around the banks
things are growing it's sustaining the
fish life and the animals and all of
us and this vision is
huge and remember in John chapter 4
Jesus brings the living
water to the woman at the
well church I put it to you you've drunk
of the Living Water there is a River of
Life flowing out of me you know that
song
yeah a foreshadowing of what's to come
Ezekiel 47 there's a river flowing out
making things new renewing
everything I put it to you that maybe we
want to share that maybe we want to
point to others to show them sorry we
want to point to
Jesus to show others how to have this
living
water in Revelation chap 22 there's the
restoration of Eden where God makes
everything come back
together we start off in Eden and it
seems like in revelation 22 we end in
Eden guess what I find in that
chapter a river flowing from the Throne
of God sustaining
everything his
Holiness emanating out this idea that
that God's presence sustains us
eternally we are filled with that
now we have that
now we are foreshadowing what's to come
we are we have his living water let's
share it with others
church so if you have Christ be excited
about the transformation that you have
been through share your story
about what Christ has done for you share
it with
others if you haven't accepted Jesus as
your
savior I wish I could tell
you that it's going to be okay but I
would be lying if I told you that I
don't believe that because like we've
seen there needs to be a transformation
in order for us to be in the presence of
God and Jesus says he's the way the life
the truth and that no man comes to God
to the father but through Jesus Christ I
don't think he's lying because there is
no other way like we've seen we need to
be changed we need to die to the law
like Paul
says and now we are married to
Christ and what does he do in that
marriage sanctifies us
don't be found unclean when you meet
your
creator make a change
today and see what the father can do for
you I'll leave you this this question
there is no other
way what are you waiting for let's stand
and sing
