Charles
Wesley who was U not a Methodist there
were no such thing as methodists then
but he was a preacher and a hyw writer
and he wrote a song that most of you
know Soldiers of Christ arise and I'm
going to go back to the original uh not
that's in Our Song Book because there's
a uh a stanza that's left out I want to
read the original I'll try to give you
the changes that have been made it says
Soldiers of Christ arise and put your
armor on strong in the strength which
God supplies through
his eternal son we our version is his
beloved Son strong in The Lord of hosts
and in his mighty power who in the
strength of Jesus trust is more than
conqueror stand then in his great might
with all of his strength endued and take
to our arm you for the fight we say but
take to arm you for the fight the
panoply of God pan refers to the uh
literally to the Armament of God the
covering leave no unguarded place no
weakness of the Soul take every virtue
every Grace and fortify the whole that
having all things done and all your
conflicts passed you may orome through
Christ alone and stand in tire at last
and then the the final verse that's not
in our books from strength to strength
go on Wrestle and fight and pray tread
all the powers of Darkness down and win
the well-thought
day I believe we are truly truly in a
war and it is not about taking prisoners
it's about winning the ultimate
battle but between the forces of Good
and Evil I think we need to recognize
how serious that is uh This Song speaks
of many Bible ways that we Face our
spiritual battles I've given you a list
there look at some of the things
protecting your heart controlling your
thought life those are critical
recognize who your true enemy is we'll
deal with a little bit of that in a
moment resist the devil he'll flee from
you fill up those empty Spots Don't
Leave a space that's mentioned in that
song invite the Holy Spirit into that
empty space because as you know uh the
devil will try to fill it avoid spaces
where there are
snares Jun go PL young people don't go
places uh that you would have a hard
time explaining to your parents why you
went there uh just don't
go that applies to adults as well by the
way can contend with the Devil Without
slandering the devil it's not your place
to talk evil of the devil quote what the
scriptures say say no more leave it
alone repent and do more good works ask
others to pray for you that's always
good especially Elders if you have
serious issues use scriptures as your
defense that's what Jesus did and seek
to grow every day in spiritual maturity
there those are just some but those are
some of the ones that are actually kind
of mentioned in that
song um but I need to say this right
here right now because we don't tend to
talk this way what I'm fixing to say and
um you need to brace
yourself you need to brace yourself you
saints of God for we do not win all the
battles the scripture is very clear on
this well well I'm a Child of God we're
going to win we do not win all the
battles Daniel 7:21 puts it this way it
says the horn was making war against the
Saints and prevailing against
them you hear
that Revelation 13:7 says this it was
granted to him to make war with the
Saints and to overcome them
so you need to be careful if you start
thinking well I'm on God's side I don't
have anything to worry
about uh I I couldn't die in this
situation uh yeah you
could persecution killed
Christians uh people have abandoned
their faith things can go so upside down
in your heart and in your life that you
can say
I want no more of it if you're not
careful and walk
away so War seems all
bad but there is a good
fight and a good
Warfare we're told in 1 Timothy 1:18
wage the good
Warfare 1 Timothy 6:12 fight the good
fight of faith and lay hold on eternal
life say Timothy 2 and ver3 endure
hardship as a good soldier Jesus Christ
now most
War I'm basically aren't you basically
against War I I I look at what's going
on in Israel and all of that and I'm
just like man I just want to pull the
plug and say stop right where you are
don't do anymore I want to look at
Ukraine and say just stop it just stop
where you are uh give them the land they
got and leave them alone quit killing
people people
um but nobody cares what I think about
that the good
fight is not attacking you listen now
I'm going right here this is the
important little truth the good fight is
not attacking or
provoking but standing for the
faith okay that's a different
attitude 2 Timothy 4:7 said I fought the
good fight and he Saidi have kept the
faith that means I defended it I guarded
the faith that would be his and those
around him that's a different so we're
not going out to fight
people if that's been your approach
that's an inappropriate
approach we
defend and keep uh Jude 1 ver3 contend
earnestly for the faith that means you
defend
the faith the faith you have the faith
others have around you Colossians 4: 6
let your speech always be with Grace
season with salt that you may know how
you ought to answer each one that's a
situation where people say how can you
dare call yourself how can you believe
how can you think when they say things
like that yes answer but don't
attack you don't call them names
right second Timothy 2:24 a servant of
the Lord must not
quarrel but be gentle to all able to
teach patient if you get angry in a
Bible study you're baptizing
nobody nobody's coming to
that we aren't about trying to win the
argument
to put somebody in their place I put
them in their place no no no no no
no 1 Corinthians 10:32 give no offense
either to the Jews or the Greeks or the
Church of God you we are not to be
people who offend
everybody like I did this morning 1
Peter
3 verses 15 and 16 sanctify the Lord God
in your heart and always always be ready
to give a
defense to everyone who ask you a reason
for the hope that is in you with
meekness and fear when they defame you
and revile your Good Conduct so you just
maintain that Good Conduct be a defender
of your faith but not an attacker of in
the Public Square it is not your place
to be an attacker we don't need attack
dogs for the
kingdom a
proclaimer but not an attack do there
are three basic qualities that jump out
in our text that I want us to walk our
through because I really think we need
to understand uh we're in the spiritual
battles and it gives three little truths
that I think will be a blessing if we
see them um number one to face our
spiritual battles we need
perspective
perspective I want you to see this
perspective the biggest thing that jumps
out at me when we walk through this
there's two things that jump out at me
when we read Ephesians
61-12 finally my brethren be strong in
the Lord in the power of His might we
are to be on God's
side
okay we must be on God's side and that
means if we're on God's side we are
against something
you can't be on a side and not be
against something it says verse 11 but
put on the whole armor of God that you
may be able to stand listen to how many
times this word comes up against the Ws
of the devil for we do not wrestle
against flesh and blood but against
principalities against Powers against
the rulers of Darkness of this age
against spiritual host of wickedness in
the Heavenly places that's perspective
we are on the Lord's Side that means we
are against much of the forces of this
world and the spiritual forces that are
behind them so if you think well I'm
really I'm this political thing be
careful be
careful because they're not always God's
people even you voting for them don't
think they're necessarily God's
people that's a mistake Luke 14:31 or
what king going to make war against
another king does not sit down first and
consider whether he's able with 10,000
to meet him who comes against him with
20,000 you need to think about how
you're going to talk to people how you
going to deal with them we're on God's
side you need perspective
this is not about beating them down but
it is about being on God's side have
that perspective I'm on God's side that
means I'm against most of what's in this
world I'm not really far it not much
around me am I
far you say well that that makes you
against just about everything
yep now you're beginning to get it you
mean you're against just about just
about because it's all just about wrong
perspective is essential it began 62
years ago when a guy named art a Jewish
kid from Queens enrolled in Columbia
University during his freshman year
orientation art met a student from
Buffalo Nam Sandy and they immediately
bonded over their shared passion for
literature and
music art and Sandy became roommates and
best
friends and they as idealistic as as
they were they promised to to always be
there for each other and they said they
meant it soon after starting College
Sandy was struck by a tragedy though his
vision became blurred had to go to the
doctors the doctors diagnosed he had
temporary
conjunctivitis but then the problem got
worse apparently that wasn't what it was
finally after seeing a specialist Sandy
received the news that he had severe
glaucoma
and it was already destroying his optic
nerves that young man had such a bright
future ahead of
him he was going to become completely
blind Sandy was
devastated as you might imagine in a
young age like that he went into deep
depression he gave up his dream of
becoming a lawyer he moved back to his
hometown and buffalo where he worried
about being a burden to already his
financial ually struggling
family he was consumed with shame and
fear so Sandy cut off contact with all
of his old friends from college
everybody he cut off from everybody
refusing to answer their letters or to
answer a phone call or return a phone
call then suddenly to Sandy shock his
buddy art showed up at the front
door he was not going to allow his best
friend to give up on life and hide away
so he bought a ticket and flew Buffalo
unannounced an art convinced Sandy to to
give College another go and he promised
him he said you know I promised you we'd
be we'd have each other's back through
thick and thin I'll be right by your
side to make sure that you don't
fail literally and
figuratively so Ark kept his promise
Faithfully escorting Sandy around the
campus and effectively serving as his
eyes it was important to art that even
though Sandy had been plunged into a
world of
Darkness that he should never feel alone
so actually Ark start started calling
himself
Darkness to demonstrate his uh concern
for his friend he'd say things like
darkness is going to read to you
now and art organized his life around
helping Sandy One Day art was guiding
Sandy through
Central
Station Grand Central Station when
suddenly he said you know I left
something give me a moment and he left
his friend standing there with thousands
of people
around and Sandy stumbled and he waited
petrified started bumping into people he
fell cut a gash in his
shin after a couple of hours that seemed
like hell to him and Terror Sandy fin
finally got on the right subway
train After exiting the station at 116th
Street Sandy bumped into someone who
quickly apologized for bumping into him
but Sandy immediately recognized the
voice it was Art's
voice turned out to be his friend who'd
been with him the whole way standing
near him the whole time trying to help
him to learn that he could be
independent
Sandy later said that moment was the
spark that caused me to live a
completely different life without fear
without doubt for that I am tremendously
grateful to my friend so Sandy went on
he graduated from Colombia and then
earned a graduate degrees at Harvard and
Oxford he was no slouch he married his
high school sweetheart and became an
extremely successful entrepreneur and
philanthropist but while at Oxford Sandy
got a call from art and this time it was
Art who needed help he had formed a kind
of a rock duo with his high school
friend Paul and they desperately needed
about $400 to record their first album
and Sandy and his wife Sue had literally
$44 in their bank account that's all
they had without hesitation
Cindy wrote Art a check for
$400 art and Paul's first album was not
a success but one of the songs you might
remember The Sound of Silence became a
number one hit a year later the opening
line echoed the way Sandy always greeted
art Simon and garun went on to become
one of the most beloved musical acts and
history as you well know Arc Garfunkle
said that when he became friends with
Sandy quote my real life
emerged I became a better guy in my own
eyes and began to see who I
was somebody who gives to a
friend Sandy describes himself as the
luckiest man in the
world and hello dark darkness my old
friend I've come to talk with you again
makes more sense now doesn't
it if you ever hear it you should listen
to Disturbed
version of The Sound of
Silence my point is is that perspective
changes everything I
think
sometimes you think you need eyes to
gain perspective but I think sometimes
perspective just helps you see the
people around you really
matter and what really
matters and what's really
serious and what's really not look
around you right now this really
matters this is really
serious it matters to face our spiritual
battles though we don't just need to
have perspective we need some
preparation it says in verses 13-1 17
therefore take up the whole armor of God
that you may be able to stand in the
evil day and by the way there are evil
days out there and having done all to
stand stand therefore having gir your
waist with Truth Listen to How many
times having repeats have you noticed
that having done all to stand stand
therefore having gir so this means you
should have already have done this you
should already prepare for that you
don't get out there and do this this is
what you do here before you go there
having done all to stand stand there
having G your was having put on the
breastplate and having Shaw your feet
with the preparation of the gospel of
peace above all taking the shield of
Faith with which you will be able to
quench all the fiery darts of the wicked
one and take the helmet of salvation the
sword of the spirit which is the word of
God we prepare
here this is what when we get ready for
there that out there is not for you it's
against
you this is where you prepare for that
Joel 3:9 says Proclaim this among the
Nations prepare for
war wake up the Mighty
Men let all the men of War draw near and
let them come
up prepare for war that's what you're
doing right now it's War out there
it's trying to tear everything you
believe down it means to do you in
preparation is essential I think we
should know that we live S com Socom
right here right we ought to know as
many military people and some of you are
in the military but as many military
people as we have known we ought to know
you got to prepare let me give you a few
examples Army basic combat trending BCT
lasts 10 weeks Marine Corps recruit
training is 13 weeks Navy basic training
is 7 weeks Air Force basic military
training is 8 and 1/2 Weeks coast guard
recruit training is 8 weeks basic
Airborne our course BAC in Fort Benning
Georgia is three weeks ground week Tower
week and jump week of five parachute
jumps each one at night with combat
equipment or at least one excuse me
including one at night with combat
equipment ranger training is 8 weeks
course and is 61 days 61 days Army
Special Forces is 45 days Air Force
Special Operation command the command
control uh career field is 35 weeks
medical Sergeant course is 14 weeks SEAL
training includes Navy recruit training
10 we Booth Camp Naval special Warfare
preparation course which is five weeks
Naval special Warfare orientation is two
weeks and buds IT training is six
months now if those men are out there to
fight a war that by the way isn't as
important as the one you're
fighting you should expect to have some
preparation
time maybe even be
here number
last to face our spiritual battles we
need
perseverance want you to pay attention
to some of the terminology
here Ephesians 6:18 praying
always with
all prayer there's different kinds of
prayer you know that right a lot of
different kinds of
prayer praying always with all prayer
and supplication in the spirit being
watchful to the end with all
perseverance and supplication for all
the saints and for me Paul says throws
himself in there that utterance may be
given to me that I may open my mouth
boldly to make known The Mystery of the
gospel for which I am an ambassador in
Chains perseverance perseverance you're
going to be in Chains perseverance that
in it I may speak boldly as I ought to
speak I really ought to speak that way 1
Corinthians 9:7 says who ever goes to
war at his own expense so God will be
with you and he will help you
persevere but you got to finish
I of like making personal references but
um I'm trying to
finish trying to
finish I'm 67 now I was baptized when I
was
10 I like
to make it to
70 might not live that long you don't
know it do you at this point my life I'm
in the in the zone I'm in the
zone your card can be pulled
anytime right and some of you young
people it can be pulled anytime for you
too by the way but but everybody knows
it could be pulled for me everybody
knows but persevering now is the most
critical time for me I I want to
finish don't you want to I want to hit
the tape as hard as I can
perseverance is essential it's it's
based on a promise that God will be with
us and a hope for better
things a man approached a little league
baseball team going on a little boy in
The Dugout he said uh son what's the
score he says it's 18 to nothing we're
behind he said boy I bet you're a little
bit discouraged right now he says why we
haven't even been to bat yet
don't give
up don't give in as a man sentenced to
death he got a reprieve for one year
promised by the king he had promised the
king to teach the king's horse to fly in
one
year on condition if he didn't succeeded
by the end of the year he would be put
to death his best friend said to him
what in the world were you thinking
why would you do such a thing as that he
says well within the year the king could
die or I may die or the horse may die or
in a year who knows maybe I'll teach the
horse to
fly just don't give
up don't give
in so what we need to face spiritual
battles is we need a little
perspective who we're fighting for and
what we're fighting against and it has
little or nothing to do with
politics it's far more serious has
little or nothing to do with Ukraine or
Israel but it's far more
serious we need
preparation that's why we come here
that's why we pray on our knees at night
that's why we prepare that's why we read
our Bibles that's why we sing songs
that's why we rub shoulders with others
who are in the battle with
us and we
need perseverance at some point we got
to realize how serious our spiritual
battles are I'm afraid that's a
difficult thing I think we have a
problem with that I I think I have a
problem with that I think it's easy to
kind of become laxidasical about it kind
of relax ah it's okay you know Lord's
going to save us any said by grace
the Devil comes at us you know that
right the devil's looking for
you because once you are baptized he
knows
you he knows you he knows your name he
knows where you live it isn't just God
that knows you the devil knows you John
10:10 he comes to steal to kill and to
destroy he is not your
friend he has no desire for you to
succeed at
anything unless you're going to work on
his side 1 Peter 5 and ver8 be
sober be vigilant because your adversary
the devil walks about like a roaring
lion seeking whom he may devour now I
spent a little time in Africa learned a
little bit about a lions in Africa
especially the male
lion lions seeking prey are silent they
don't Roar there's quiet as a
mouse so why would the devil be a
roaring
line a roaring line is Seeking a battle
with another lion what that means is the
devil's a little scared of
you and he's trying to build up enough
courage to tack on to a lion he knows
he's dealing with the lion like the lion
of the tribe of Judah a roaring lion is
one seeking to gain
territory of another lion he's seeking
the female lions from another lion he
wants to take more
territory so a roaring lion is one
seeking to devour another lion another
big male
lion a roaring line is not one seeking
easy prey because if he Roars next to a
gazelle it's
gone he Roars next to a sick one it's
going to run
there is a severe battle going on if you
ever watch television and you ever see
two male lions fight you will begin to
realize what I'm talking about this is
violent you think that this thing is
peaceful and safe and it's all nice and
woo woo woo and all kissy face with the
devil no my friend the Devil comes to
steal to kill and destroy look at what
two male lines do to each other
male lions only live between 8 to 11
years almost never live older than that
because the females live about 16 years
but the male lines don't live long
because of these battles they're so
severe that means that our time is short
you say well I don't like the sound of
this it's not going to last long
anyway I was 30 yesterday
I was just yesterday I asked Deb to go
to the movies with
me it's just yesterday we were in the
hospital in Alexander City looking at
Heath it's just
yesterday this is a short
battle but it can be
violent maybe you've heard of band
Brothers I'm not talking about Saturday
by the way B Brothers starts back
Saturday
Okay private Albert BL has talking to
Captain Ronald
Spears BL says Lieutenant
sir now they're in a foxo or at least BL
is Lieutenant sir when I landed on D-Day
I found myself in a ditch all by myself
I fell asleep I think it was air
sickness pills they gave us
when I woke up I really didn't try to
find my
unit to
fight I just uh I just kind of stayed
put spear said what's your name
Trooper he said I'm BL sir Albert BL
spear said you know why you hid in that
ditch
BL blle says I I was
scared spear says we're all
scared you HD in that ditch because you
think there's still
hope but
BL the only hope you have is to accept
the fact that you're already
dead that's a message to us all
you're already
dead if that's not true you had no
business being
baptized and if you don't realize how
serious that is you had no business
being
baptized you're already dead quit
worrying about all this other stuff
you're already dead get in the spiritual
warfare see have some perspective make
some
preparation but then then persevere to
the end you're already dead and your
life is hid with Christ and God and when
Christ who is our life shall appear then
you shall appear with him in glory
that's our goal if you haven't made that
your goal there a good opportunity to
make it your goal right now by coming
while we stand while we sing
