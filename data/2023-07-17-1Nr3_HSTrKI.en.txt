2 Timothy 3:1 says but know this that in
the last days perilous times will
come pretty much where we are for men
will be lovers of themselves lovers of
money boasters proud blasphemers
disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy
unloving
unforgiving slanderers without
self-control brutal despisers of good
traitors headstrong hay lovers of
pleasure rather than lovers of God
having a form of godliness but denying
its power and from such people turn
away the idea behind this lesson comes
actually from actually was reading
sermon by uh CH
Spurgeon and the points that I making
tonight are his points so it's not
original at all I thought his points
were valid and needed to be said
again
oxymorons you like
oxymorons there are a lot of them it's
basically if you're if you don't know
what an oxymoron is you probably do but
it's a phrase that has contradictory
terms embedded in the in the phrase for
example here here are a few deafening
silence awfully
good Open
Secret freezer
burn Silent
Scream clearly
misunderstood
Bittersweet Civil
War uh
definite posit possibility
exact
estimate extinct
life grow
smaller only
choice random
order one you were familiar with I'm
sure jumbo
shrimp old
news original
copy plastic
silverware true
fiction virtual
reality and working
vacation those are called
oxymorons uh Claire Clara Barton with
red cross said something similar so some
sentences are like
oxymorons I distinctly remember
forgetting
that Dolly Parton said you'd be
surprised how much it costs to look this
cheap
Isaac Singer a novelist said we must
believe in free will we have no
choice Mark Twain said it usually takes
more than three weeks to prepare a good
impromptu spe
speech Samuel Goldwin film producer you
probably remember him said a verbal
contract isn't worth the paper it's
written
on those contain oxymorons when you have
two different
ideas and because of that I was thinking
about that when I heard the term I was
thinking about the word gay pride that
to me seems to be like an
oxymoron now in case you think that they
have a pride problem and the rest of us
are fine we all have a pride
problem we we all are too proud and
won't admit our
sin you and I are not indispensable to
the kingdom of
God uh not one person in this building
is too
humble you're not too
humble even if you're the humblest
person in this
room you're not too humble in fact I
don't recall anybody being called too
humble in in the Bible do you remember
that in Paul's time the term humble was
repudiated it was thought to be terrible
Pride was thought to be the thing you
should have sounds familiar doesn't
it the very opposite of Love is pride
and arrogance and it has to brag 1
Corinthians 13 verse four says love does
not
brag and is not
arrogant love does not
brag and is not arrogant so in other
words basically pride is the opposite of
Love pride is most often known by what
it says about
itself Pride feels the need to brag and
boast of what it
thinks who it is what it
does I don't know uh many of you watched
the thing with Johnny Depp and Amber
herd any y'all see any of that stuff
back when it was happening all right so
what caught my attention beyond the
weirdness of all of that was a YouTuber
named Emily
dbaker now Emily D Baker covered that
whole thing with Johnny Depp and Amber
herd now Emily de Baker I got started
watching her as a result so now I'm kind
of watch her
stuff uh maybe you remember that Alex
Murdoch trial all that some of y'all
follow that the murder of his wife and
son so maybe some of you follow that
well who Emily debaker is and this is
where telling this whole story is she
was for 17 years she was a uh La Deputy
district
attorney uh where she prosecuted
criminals various uh
problems one time she had these two
criminals that were
arrested and they had pulled off uh uh
several um H uh crimes where they had
stolen the lot and one of them thought
he was a
genius and he was basically The
Mastermind so he thought he was so much
smarter than Emily who was
Prosecuting that he just could talk
circles around
her so what Emily did was Emily baker
said he she started bragging on the
other guy the guy that wasn't as smart
and wasn't supposedly a genius and
started bragging on him and kept T he
had had the the brilliant guy on the
stand and kept asking him questions so
your friend he came up with all this
right yes and it's all him right and he
figured out how to do this and he
figured out how to do that and he did
this and he did that and she kept piling
on all the things she'd figured out
finally in the middle of all that he
says that man couldn't have done all
that I did all
that and she said okay thank you and she
sat
down he was just convicted by his own
words by his own
pride pride goes before destruction and
a hoty spirit before a fall Pride will
take us all down if we're not
careful and I guarantee you there's been
a point in which you've been embarrassed
because of your
pride and if you haven't that really
says even more about you because you're
never
embarrassed and that's bad so what we
want to do is look at four little truths
okay and all of these uh not original of
me but I thought it was such a brilliant
concept first of all pride is baseless
we're going to look at four four things
tonight pride is
baseless no
one and not one good
thing is ever said about pride in the
Bible you look for
it we believe that there's a good Pride
the Bible
doesn't you hear
me not
once it's never used as a
positive
ever and look at all the scriptures
where it says bad things about
it okay no we don't have
time take a snapshot of it take it home
with you uh there is nothing to be proud
of is the
point now think about that just for a
second you and I have
nothing to be proud of related to
us Proverbs 13:10 says by Pride listen
to the statement by pride comes nothing
but Strife that pretty well Nails it
shut doesn't it the only thing that
Pride gives you is
trouble so Pride goes before a fall and
it teaches us that we should avoid Pride
because it's absolutely baseless you
have no reason to have it so if you're
proud of something you've done get over
it calm down and realize you're saved by
grace number
two not only is pride baseless pride is
graceless not one person has ever been
saved by
pride no one goes to heaven because he
had pride in
himself that's never stated you might
have said it you may think it's that
because you've listened to our culture
but it's not in the Bible that way and I
know I'm probably making some of you who
are into all this self-confidence kind
of material that's out there feel rather
offended Grace is only for the
humble he doesn't extend grace to the
proud that's not stated
ever grace is for the
humble but habc 2 and verse4 says this
behold the proud his soul is not upright
in him but the just this is the key
passage in the New Testament but the
just shall live by faith that's the
that's the passage Paul uses to prove
we're saved by grace through faith the
just shall live by faith what does he
mean live in that text he takes it to
mean eternal life if you're going to
live eternally you live eternally by
faith but look at what's in the
beginning of this verse Behold The Proud
his soul is not
upright so nothing in us and this this
is a hard one to
accept nothing in US deserves to be
forgiven nothing in US deserves to be
saved
that was one of the hardest
lessons that I ever
learned and I was insane at the time and
I was when I was having my emotional
problems in South
Africa I realized that there was nothing
in
me apart from
him that was worthy of anything and that
was a hard if you've never come to a
realization of that
about yourself you should but it's a
hard one when you're as proud as I was
at that
moment so Pride before a fall teaches us
to avoid Pride because pride is
graceless so it's
baseless it's
graceless number next I think this is
three I get confused in these big
numbers pride is
shapeless pride is shapeless what do I
mean by that not one kind of pride is
the exception to
it in other words we want to think that
there's an exceptional kind of
Pride we want
to but you can't find it listen I've
looked for it you go look I've looked
for it I wanted to find
it pride comes in every shape there is
social logical Pride
there is ecclesiastical Pride people who
are just proud of
church there is psychological Pride
proud of your psyche your abilities in
your brain there's political Pride y'all
ever heard of that people who look down
on the other party polit we've never
heard of that in church have we
political Pride there's cultural Pride
you don't believe that travel around the
world a little bit you'll find right
away that every culture thinks their
culture is the way it should be or
they'd be
different there is generational Pride
have you not felt it young people that
old people talk down to
you have you not felt it old people that
young people talk down to
you there's national pride America is
the greatest
you know the worst place to do that is
on a mission trip please don't do that
don't go on a mission trip and talk
about how you think America it's natural
to love your country but please shut up
about it in another
country when we were living in South
Africa I hated to see an American coming
it was an embarrassment to me they
wouldn't shut up oh we've got that in
America oh we do that oh we got that
better in
America do you not know that uh
everybody loves their
country it doesn't mean what you think
it means there's racial Pride there a
racial Pride that thinks your race is
the coolest and every other race is the
worst and I don't care what color you
are that hits
everybody there is moral Pride I've been
moral therefore I am great cuz I am a
moral
person there's physical Pride I can beat
you
up or I can lift 75 lbs more than you
can there is mental Pride oh I'm sharp
I'm the smartest cookie in the room my
IQ is 145
plus
okay there's intellectual Pride because
you were able to take really good
tests there's educational Pride I have
17 degrees behind my name
there's narciss uh I can't even say this
narcissistic Pride where
is you have to love me I'm just too
goodlook now guys don't generally say
that although they
do but a woman or two has been known to
think they're beautiful I've had women
tell me oh I know I'm beautiful I'm like
okie
dokie there's sexual Pride
thinking your sex is better than someone
else's male or female there's entirely
too much of that going on in our society
that we're having arguments about what's
better a man or a woman that's
ridiculous
conversations God made one he made the
other one how do you take pride in
something God
did it's homosexual Pride which kind of
made referen to before there's Financial
Pride I make more than you do okay or I
make less than you do okay neither one
makes you better than anybody else by
the way there's influential Pride oh I
know the governor okay so I know a lot
of crooks too so there's religious Pride
so our church is going to heaven and
your church
isn't and then there's secular Pride
so there's all kinds of
shapes but what I'm trying to get to is
no matter what shape you put it in
you're not saved by Pride you're saved
by grace John 2 1 John 2:16 says for all
that is in the world the lust of the
flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride
of life is not of the father but is of
the world this Pride business is not
from
God it's from the devil but we want to
think it's a wonderful
thing Pride before a fall now I know
some of you out there you already
figured out 15 ways that there's a way
that I miss interpreting the
word that's your pride thinking
there but you may be right because
that's my pride thinking
that who struggles with pride
I'm looking at them and you are too the
people who struggle with pride and if
you don't think you struggle with pride
you struggle with it more than anybody
else in the
room Pride before a fall teaches us to
avoid Pride because pride is shapeless
it affects all kinds of stuff it's not
over here in this one little box and not
over here it's in this problem but it's
not in that no it's not the way Pride
works it fits into any box you're in
in and you can look down on folks from
anywhere when you're looking up at
them number next last
one pride is defenseless so it is
baseless it is graceless it is shapeless
and it's defenseless not one person can
avoid the damage that it
causes Pride causes damage it first
causes damage to you but then it causes
damage to the people around you they
used to say that pride is that weird
sickness that makes everybody else
sick many so-called great
leaders some of the greatest we've read
about have been struck down because
their pride you ever heard of a guy
named
Moses Numbers chapter 21 through1 13
what kept Moses out of celan oh he's
just old and he died died well he did
die but that ain't the reason he didn't
go to Canan land he didn't go to Canan
land because he was proud and he lost
his temper and he spoke in advisedly to
the people of God and called him a bunch
of rebels like he had no problems but
they had
trouble well that's never true you've
never seen a speaker up here that didn't
have
trouble what about when you're a king
Well Kings don't have this kind of
problem King nebuchad Nebuchadnezzar
literally the most powerful man in the
world at the time Daniel 4:
28-29 because he walked around saw all
the things he had made and he became so
chuffed with himself he said by my own
hand I've created all these things and
in that same hour he struck and he spent
several months out in the field with his
hair looking like feathers eating grass
like a cow he lost his marbles for a
while because he was full of Pride 2
Chronicles 166 uh 2616 King Isaiah great
king king Isaiah was a good king of
Israel he really was there are many good
things I could say about you about King
oiah but he got full of himself at some
point and when he got full of himself he
decided that he was such a good man he
could go into the Temple of the Lord
himself and he could offer incense just
like the priest did and while he was
doing it the priest came in and says
this is not for you King you're a good
man but this is not for you you need to
get out of here and he fussed with
them and he was struck with Leprosy and
he was a leper the rest of his
life in Acts 12: 23 King
Herod made a
speech and he's wearing according to
history he's wearing a kind of a gold uh
kind of outfit they were was gold all
waved into the material so his outfit
glowed in the Sun so he made this speech
trying to make friends with some people
he'd made mad and they said oh behold
the voice of a God and he didn't
repudiate it he accepted it and he was
struck immediately with worms and about
3 days later he died in a horrible way
now most recently these are not the only
people have had real serious problems
with pride we all have problem with
pride not all of us have that serious of
a problem but these people had serious
problems but there were others you might
have heard a guy named musolini people
hung him Hitler he killed himself uh
Nikolai chesu his people killed him and
Drug him through the streets in
Wikipedia there's
349 heads of government and heads of
state that have been assassinated and
executed by their people because the PE
the people realized they've elevated
themsel too far
full of thems see you can fall through
Pride that's the reason Proverbs 16:18
that was read a while ago simply says
Pride goes before destruction and a Hy
spirit before a
fall on the day of
judgment how many proud people do you
think there will
be how many proud people do you think
there will be that says I will not kneel
don't talk down to me
God I know more than you
do you will
kneel and you will be the humblest
you've ever
been there's not been a night when you
were alone and you were crying that you
will ever be as humble as you'll be that
moment
nothing can defend
you if you're depending on
Pride but
humility that might get you somewhere
that
day so Pride before fall teaches us to
avoid Pride because pride is defenseless
pride is baseless it's graceless it's
shapeless it's
defenseless how
often have our words betrayed
us I know we think we all think we're
humble have you not noticed
it I look in the mirror and I get more
humble every
day we portray ourselves as humble we
even use words to describe ourselves as
humble but our words prove that we're
proud and we're
haughty and we think ourselves Superior
to some people
in Luke 19:22 out of your own mouth I
will judge you I'm afraid that will
happen to us
all Matthew 12 and: 37 by your words
you'll be justified and by your words
you'll be
condemned let me give you an example of
that last thing up there you remember
the movie 1992 it's probably the best
movie in my opinion
that uh Tom Cruz ever made before this
Top Gun this last Top Gun A Few Good Men
in that movie uh Lieutenant Cathy is Tom
Cruz and Jack Nicholson great actor uh
is Colonel
Jessup and Colonel Jessup had ordered a
code red and I don't know if that's a
big thing or not a big thing it just it
was important in the movie because two
young men were being um basically put on
Tru for having done the code red code
red is when you
basically you know rough up one of the
guys because he's not keeping up or
whatever so Cathy asks Colonel Jess did
you order the code red and Jess said I
did my
job and Cathy said did you order the
code
red and finally he says you bet your
blankety blank blank I ordered the code
R what did that do to him immediately he
was
arrested it's just a
movie but it's the same
thing whenever you start thinking I can
get away I can do I have the right you
can't talk to
me that's when you get in
trouble that's the moment that's when it
happens to us all when we start thinking
you owe
me no they
don't
no
no maybe we don't know how to Humble
ourselves maybe we don't let me read a
couple of scriptures 1 Peter 55 and 6 be
submissive to one another and be clothed
with humility for God resists the proud
but gives grace to the humble therefore
humble yourselves under the mighty hand
of God that he may exalt you in due
time that's gives us little insight
James 4: 6-10 says this trying to figure
out what humility really is God resists
the
proud so all our proud Act gets resisted
there's push back on it God resists the
proud but gives grace to the humble
therefore submit to God that's the
reverse of
Pride you submit to
God draw near to
God and He will draw near to
you cleanse your hands you Sinners and
yeah he's talking to members of the
church cleanse your hands you sinners
purify your heart you double-minded
because I know you've been in two places
in your head so have I
lament
mourn weep what's there to lament mourn
and weep about oh now we know who's the
proud
one you
sinned when's the last time you lamented
it when's the last time you were in
tears about your
sin lament and mourn and
weep let your laughter Oh everything's
so funny right let your laughter be
turned to mourning and your joy to Gloom
why because verse 10 humble yourselves
in the sight of the Lord and He will
lift you up that's the only lifting up
you need is whatever he will give you
that's it so submit clothe yourself with
humility draw near to God cleanse your
hands purify your hearts lament mourn
weep those are things that reflect
humility we were fixed out an invitation
um here's the
deal there's no such thing as a person
coming forward in invitation
proudly
I'm not sure there is such a thing as
anybody worshiping God
proudly is
there so what good does it do you oh I
know well you got to believe in
yourself I've heard all of that I've
read all those books
too I'm just telling you the Bible
tonight you can believe whatever you
want and I'm sure you
will
you know when you hear something like
that kind of makes you realize that
somebody else is in control do
it don't come with
pride come in
humility you know there's there's two
principles I don't talk about this very
much this not really what my lesson is
about but I just thought I'd share this
right now there's the normative
principle
and there's the regulatory
principle okay the normative principle
says and it's a principle of of how to
understand the Bible the normative
principle basically says if it isn't
forbidden it's allowed you can do
whatever the Bible doesn't say you can't
do I mean I believe that principle but
it don't believe it applies to
everything but it do believe in the
principle I'll tell you where it applies
I think in a minute but then there's a
regulatory principle now regulatory
principle basically says this if it is n
authorized it's automatically forbidden
and you shouldn't do it so which one is
correct if it isn't forbidden it's
allowed or if it isn't authorized it's
forbidden which one is correct they're
both correct but they apply to two
different
things and if you don't recognize that
you probably pull
up
Pride so where does the normative
principle apply day-to-day to
life you go in the grocery store you
don't have to ask God whether or not you
should get milk or you should get ice
cream whatever it's up to you you make
up decisions on your own it's pretty
much how you live your life if it isn't
forbidden you can have it you can eat
ice cream and go to heaven there are
people who don't believe you can you can
eat meat and go to heaven there are
people that don't believe you can do
that too yeah there are a lot of things
you can do that other people frown on
because the Bible doesn't say one way or
the other because it's just your day
day-to-day activities but when we come
here to worship
God if it isn't
authorized it's
forbidden and if we don't treat it that
way then we approach God in a very
halfhazard arrogant way this is the
Divine being there's only one we must be
very careful how we approach him we must
be very humble in how we approach him
it's why we don't have instrumental
music that principle right there that's
it it is why we don't have women
speakers and preachers you may think we
should you believe in the normative
principle I however don't believe in
having belly dancers in
worship and anything else why because
well that's not forbidden
either the list is is without an end if
we use the normative principle for
worship but if you use the regulatory
principle and whatever isn't authorized
is
forbidden then guess what we have a
limited things that we can do about five
things and we do those five things and
that's
it you know what that's the humble
path which what you worship
humbly or arrogantly and insist on what
you
want how do you live humbly or
arrogantly and insist on what you want I
think the lesson and the sound above me
suggest we ought to approach God as
humbly as we can if you're not right
with God we give you an opportunity by
an invitation now to make that right
haven't really preached on that subject
but whatever your need let it be known
while we stand and while we sing
