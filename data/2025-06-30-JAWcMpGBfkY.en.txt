Now, the Lord
wants your home to be the home of the
blessed. I promise you that is his goal
for you. In fact, John 14:23 says, "If
anyone
loves me,
he will keep my word,
and my father will love him,
and we will come to him and make our
home
with him." There it is,
with him.
Luke 13:34 says, "How often I wanted to
gather your children together as a hen
gathers her brood under her wings." Have
you ever seen that? It's a pretty thing
to see. Little chicks underneath their
mom.
But you were not willing. It's not that
he doesn't want it. He wants to live in
your home. He wants to be the center of
your home.
And if that's true, that's the home of
the blessed.
I've heard a lot of lessons, gone to a
lot of conferences on marriage. I've
attended just about everything you can
find in the church of Christ on marriage
as far as some conference on it.
And it's been my conclusion that
marriage doesn't last for most of the
things they end up talking about. It's
not the reason. I've heard lessons on
sex. Marriage doesn't last because of
that. I've heard lessons on money.
Marriage doesn't last because of that.
I've heard lessons on communication.
Marriage doesn't last because of that.
I've heard lessons on compatibility.
Marriage doesn't last because of that.
The one thing I have found that marriage
lasts because of is this. if Jesus is in
your home. But that's not it. Jesus can
be in your home, but not fully in your
home because Jesus has to be first in
this home right here.
 It's got to be in
this home right here.
 It's got to be in
this home right here.
 It's got to be in
every home right here in the home. So
Jesus is in your home, but it's got to
be in your home and your home and your
home and your home and your home and
your everyone right here. The home must
be here. And if Jesus is in that home,
you're a blessed home. And marriages
make it and families make it when that
is the case. Felix Melson,
German composer, pianist,
organist, conductor of the romantic
period
was uh he composed something. If you
don't know who he is, Mendelson uh
you've probably heard this before.
Da dum dum dum. Right, it's not one of
the dumbest tunes, but it is one you've
probably heard before,
and it's a wedding march. That's
Mendlesson.
Um, one day, uh, he heard of this great
organ in a particular town and he went
to see it. He really wanted to play it.
He went up in the loft and he was a he
asked the guy who oversaw it if he'd be
allowed to play and the old organist
didn't want him to, you know, he's very
protective. He didn't know who he was.
Very protective of his equipment. Didn't
want it tore up or something and he's
jealous over it. So, he first refused
and then finally afterward he prevailed
on it, kept asking and seemed to know
what he was doing. So he led him and and
then he played and the regular organist
was like, "Oh wow."
And to think I almost didn't let you
play. What is your what is your name?
And he told him Mendlesson. He said, "Oh
my, I almost didn't let the greatest
organist in the country or even the
world potentially not play on this piece
of equipment."
What's parallel to that is I think
Christians often refuse to let God have
his way in our life.
It's it's a sad idea that
the greatest help and helper you could
ever have to make your life work
and you would refuse it. There could be
such great music coming out of you.
But no, you want to protect it so that
you can have it your way. And you're
afraid of what he would do if he took
control.
What if he took control? What would
happen to my life? Would I have freedom?
Would I be able to do the things I want
to do? And the answer to that is no.
No.
and take it from someone who lost his
mind but found him.
It's best to let him run things.
In a home of the blessed, there is great
respect for the Lord.
My son, do not dismiss my law. It says
in Proverbs 3 and several things I want
to quote from Proverbs 3. My son, do not
forget my law, but let your heart keep
my commands.
Don't dei dismiss his law.
Don't be like that man that won't let
him play.
My son, do not despise my chastening.
Proverbs 3:11, "My son, do not despise
the chastening of the Lord, nor detest
his correction. It's the best thing that
can happen to you when you're being
chasened by the Lord.
What?
My son, do not disregard my wisdom.
Proverbs 3 verse 21. My son, let them
not depart from your eyes. Keep sound
wisdom and discretion. What I'm
suggesting to you is in the home of the
blessed, there is such great respect for
the Lord
that we gladly say you play.
In the home of the blessed, not only is
there great respect for the Lord, but
there are great promises from the Lord
that are absolutely trusted.
The Lord counsels the home of the
upright.
He counsels the home of the upright.
Proverbs 3:32,
same chapter. For the perverse perverse
person, excuse me, is an abomination to
the Lord. But his secret counsel is with
the upright. That's right. The Lord
tells you specially secret truths that
help you through.
The Lord blesses the home of the just.
Verse 33, Proverbs 3. Still the curse of
the Lord is on the house of the wicked,
but he blesses the home of the just. The
just are people who try to do the fair
and right thing.
The Lord graces the home of the humble.
Still, Proverbs 3 and verse 34, surely
he scorns the scornful, but he gives
grace to the humble. There's humility
because of the awareness, the great
promises of the Lord in the home who
trust God. So the home of the blessed
is great and it has great endurance. I
want to look at four situations from the
text that we're looking at today of how
that the situations aren't necessarily
any different from our situations and
anybody you find out on the street. What
happens in our homes often happens out
there as far as the tough things that
come our way. There's not a lot of
difference. You don't see a lot of
difference between dying and dying.
You don't see a lot of difference
between sick and sick. You don't see a
lot of difference between money and no
money. You don't see a lot of difference
between their households and our
households when it comes to physical
things. However, there is a thing that
happens in our households that doesn't
happen out there. It's called endurance.
And I'll look at four ways that that's
true. And it's because the home of the
blessed is built on the word of Jesus
Christ and Jesus himself.
Number one,
the home of the blessed will endure the
reigns.
That's what it says in our text. Let me
read it again for you. Therefore,
whoever hears these sayings of mine and
does them. So, it's not just somebody
who hears but obeys. I will liken him to
a wise man who built his house on the
rock. That rock is Jesus, by the way.
And the rain descended,
but it didn't fall. It was founded on
not a rock, but the rock.
And then we read, what does this mean?
The rains came. The rains could make
even a home of faith
delirious and tremble. Folks, listen to
Ezra 10:9. All the people sat in the
open square of the house of God,
trembling
because of this matter and because of
the heavy rain. I want to use that as an
illustration.
There's going to be rainy days in your
home
and you're going to tremble.
And you young people who think, "Oh,
life is a breeze." That our my parents
have had it easy. Let me tell you
something. They've had trembling days.
The rain has come and it has been heavy.
What is that rain? Well, it's many
things, but into every life a rainy day
must come. And into that rain is
sadness. There's hardship. There's
difficulties. The home of the blessed
has rain.
But it endures it.
So the home of the blessed will endure
the rain. The delirium that comes from
will it ever stop?
Will it ever leave us alone? Will it
ever go away? Will I ever have relief?
Maybe not. But we will endure.
Our relationship will endure. our family
will endure. How do I know that's true?
How do you know that's true? Because I
know her and I know me and I know him.
Amen.
 I know what will happen. I don't
Amen.
 I know what will happen. I don't
Amen.
 I know what will happen. I don't
have any doubt about it. It is because
of him, not me.
It is because of him. Number two, the
home of the blessed will endure the
floods. Floods will come. Look at what
he says. Therefore, whoever hears these
sayings of mine and does them, I will
liken him to a wise man who built his
house on the rock again. And the rain
descended, and the floods came. It's not
just rain. It's not just rain. Floods
are coming.
And it did not fall, for it was founded
on the rock. What are these floods that
can carry even your home away almost?
There floods of defeat from who?
From your enemy.
Isaiah 59:1 19. When the enemy comes in
like a flood, the spirit of the Lord
will lift up a standard against him.
Just like you, we've seen the flood of
the enemy. What's the flood of the
enemy? Not one enemy, not two enemies,
not three enemies, not four enemies,
another enemy, another enemy, another
enemy. Oh, another enemy. Another enemy.
Another enemy. Another enemy. Another
enemy. Another one. Another one. Another
one. When is it going to stop? There's
another enemy coming. There's another
one. Another one. We've seen days like
that, too. Just like you. You think
you're the only one that's seen a day
where you didn't know when the enemy is
going to stop? I'm telling you, the
devil wants to destroy. He wants to take
you apart. He wants you to not have any
faith at all. He wants you to just drop
it and walk away. That's what he wants.
And he will send another enemy and
another enemy. The home of the blessed
endures the floods of the enemies of
your faith. And I assure you, there are
many. And there's not one kind. There
are millions of kinds of those enemies.
And the home of the devil, the floods of
the defeats. That's right. Are you
saying you've been defeated? I've been
defeated so many times I don't even know
how to get up some mornings. We've all
been defeated. I wake up defeated
and then I remember serve. Amen. You
remember who you serve. Put your pants
on and get back out there and do it
again. Amen. The flood's the enemy's
come at the home of the faithful endures
because he knows who beats the enemy. I
don't beat the enemy. I can't beat the
enemy. I can just endure. He has already
won the war. It's already over. I'm just
watching action. Amen. Just watching
action. Hanging on.
Number three,
the home of the blessed will endure the
winds.
Listen to what it says.
Therefore, whoever hears these sayings
of mine and does them, I will lock in
him to a wise man who built his house
upon the rock. Bet you've heard that
verse already this morning. Verse 25.
And the rain descended, the floods came,
and the winds blew.
It didn't fall
or was founded on the rock. We've seen
the winds. Haven't you seen the winds?
What are the winds? Winds are changed of
crazy ideas.
I mean, there's every crazy thought you
can come up with are in the world today.
You want to hear something crazy, just
listen five minutes to the news. You
want to hear something else crazy,
listen five minutes to your neighbor
talk. You want to hear something else
crazy? Just watch what's going on in
your neighborhood. There's nothing but
crazy out there. One, and by the way, it
ain't just crazy. It's changing crazy.
It's crazy today, but it'll be crazier
tomorrow. There's something different
and crazy tomorrow. Some crazy idea. And
they're It's always You don't know what
you're doing. You don't know what you
believe. You don't They're always trying
to tell us we don't know what in the
world we believe. That everything we
believe is wrong. It's all out there.
They're all telling us all the time. And
every day they change the story to try
to convince you even more.
But we know what we believe. Amen. We
believe in a risen Lord Jesus Christ.
Amen. That's what we believe. And we
believe his words are true. And if you
follow his words, your life will be
okay. You don't, you're going to be
messed up. I know because I've been on
the other side of that equation. And it
was nothing but mess on the other side
of that equation.
But listen to what it says. These winds
could sway even the home of the
faithful. because they throw so much
deception against you, so many lies.
Ephesians 4:14, no longer be children
tossed to and fro and carried about by
every wind of doctrine. The wind changes
every You don't know where it's coming
from, don't know where it's going, but
I'm telling you, it's coming at you.
There's wind all around. The home of the
blessed endures these winds of doctrines
and lies and chains and things that your
family will tell you and others that are
so-called your friends will tell you,
"Oh, I'd never put up with that from a
man or I'd never put up for that from a
woman." You don't listen to a word of
you. Listen to the word of God and
follow him. That's it. So, the home of
the blessed will endure
the winds of deception.
Lastly,
the home of the blessed will endure the
beatings.
Oh, there's beatings.
Therefore, whoever hears these sayings
of mine and does them, I will liken him
to a wise man who built his house upon a
rock. And the rains descended, the
floods came, and the winds blew, and
beat
beat on that house.
It didn't fall.
Was founded upon the rock.
We've seen times of beating. I've been
beaten so many. Haven't you been beaten?
I mean, just beaten. Beat down.
Beaten. Some people act like, "Oh, well,
yeah, you never had it. We You don't
know what we've had." That's what you
think. I mean, you you don't know how
hard it's been for me, Brother Rex.
Yeah. None of us know exactly what the
other one's doing, but if you think
anybody's getting out of these beatings,
you're crazy. We've all been beaten.
We've all been beaten down.
The beatings could coers even a home of
the faith to be in despair. Listen to 2
Corinthians 4 and verse 8. I love the
words of Paul here.
Impressed on every side
but not crushed.
Perplexed
but not in despair.
The home of the blessed endures beatings
and crushings
and harm.
But every home of faith must endure the
beatings, the attacks, the opponents.
Every home must endure the rains, the
sadness. Every home of the faithful must
endure the overwhelming floods of
enemies. Every home of the blessed must
endure the winds of change, of people
being told false teachings everywhere
you are. The home of the blessed endures
the beatings.
Stephen and Margene Green,
this is too old for good portion of you,
back in 1986,
saying this. It speaks to this point
about
a household of faith.
Here we are at the start committing to
each other.
This is a couple, by the way. This is
husband and wife, Steen, Steve and
Margene. Here we are at the start
committing to each other by his word and
from our hearts.
We will be a family and a house that
will be a home and with faith we'll
build it strong. will build build a
household of faith that together we can
make and when the strong winds blow it
won't fall down as one in him will grow
and the whole world will know that we
are a household of faith now to be a
family we've got to love each other at
any cost unselfishly
and our home must be a place that fully
abounds with grace, a reflection of his
faith. We'll build a household of faith
that together we can make. And when the
strong winds blow, it won't fall down.
As one in him will grow and the whole
world will know we
are a household of faith.
the incredible power
of growing up in a household of faith.
It isn't just for you. It is so that
your children will see how to be
the incredible power of receiving a
parents blessing in a blessed home. You
don't just do it for you, you do it for
them and the next generation. Ted
Krueger in some of you have read some of
these Chicken Soup for the Soul. He
wrote this story and I just need to
include it here. It's not long. Said, "I
have many memories about my father and
about growing up with him in an
apartment complex in the elevated track
train tracks." Y'all know about elevated
train tracks like in Chicago.
For years, we listened to the roar of
the train as it passed by. Late at
night, my father waited alone for the
train that took him to a factory where
he worked the night shift.
On this particular night,
I waited with him in the dark to say
goodbye.
His face was grim.
His youngest son had been drafted.
I would be sworn in at 6 the next
morning while he was at the factory.
My father didn't want them to take his
child was only 8, 19 years old to fight
a war in Europe. Tells you how old this
is.
He placed his hands on my shoulders and
said,
"You be careful
and if you need anything,
write to me
and I'll see you get it."
Suddenly, he heard the roar of the
approaching train coming in.
He held me tightly in his arms and he
gently kissed me on the cheek.
With tearfilled eyes, he murmured,
"I love you, my son."
Then the train arrived.
The doors closed him inside and he
disappeared into the night and I left
for boot camp.
One month later
at age 46,
my father died.
I am now 76 years old. As I sit here and
write this, I once heard Pete Hamill,
the New York reporter, say that memories
are man's greatest inheritance. And I
have to agree.
I've lived through four invasions in
World War II.
I've had a life full of all kinds of
experiences.
But the only memory that lingers in the
night my dad said,
"I love you, my son."
That's what I remember.
The home of the blessed
even here on earth is epitomized in the
song by James Row. We sing it here. Home
of the soul,
beautiful home,
there we shall rest,
never to roam,
free from all care,
happy and bright.
Jesus is there
and he is the light.
You see, there's several homes of the
soul. One where you're raised, one where
moms and dads work it out.
There's one in heaven.
There's another one. It's right here.
But if Jesus is not in your heart, you
don't know what I'm talking about.
If you're not trying to follow his word,
you don't know what I'm talking about.
You've got no idea how important this is
if you don't have it.
Once you have it,
you will never let it go.
Wouldn't you like to have it
if you would set your heart
toward him,
surrender your heart to Jesus literally
and decide to obey his word, repenting
of your sins, confessing his name, you
could be baptized even today and start
that walk on. Then that would be the
household of faith. And then it would
broaden to your family. And that would
be the household of faith. And it would
broaden to this church. And this would
be the household of faith. And then it
would broaden to the household of faith
above. Want that to be for you? Won't
you come if you need to while we stand
and while we
