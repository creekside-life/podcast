all right if you all have a Bible I hope
you all have a Bible let's turn to the
Book of Ruth Ruth chapter 1 verse one
and we're going to I'm going to do a lot
of reading today and uh there's some
parts where I want to stop and we want
to talk about it but
uh we'll bring it all together at the
end and how this represents Christ so
Ruth chapter 1 verse
one in the days when the judges
ruled there was a famine in the land and
a man from Bethlehem in Judah together
with his his wife and two sons went to
live for a while in the country of Moab
WR that very first sentence there in the
days when the judges ruled let let me
paint the picture for us here if you go
to the page just before that the page
where it says judges 21 and it says
verse
25 in those
days Israel had no king
everyone did as he saw
fit I don't think I have to expand too
much on that we can look into the world
today when people do whatever they feel
that they want to do it turns into
absolute chaos right so this is
sometimes described as some of the
darkest days of the
Israelites so I'm going to read that
again in the days when the judges ruled
there was a famine in the land so you've
got this chaos already ensuing
and now we have a
famine right this is a struggle and a
man from Bethlehem in Judah together
with his wife and two sons went to live
for a while in the country of Moab some
of your versions might say so
John right which means they they
intended to go they but come
back
right but here's the
issue the seven books before this from
Genesis up to judges we see the story of
how God promised this land to these
people and so he's brought them into
this land only for ELC and his family to
leave kind of the opposite of what God
wanted right so you got to go uh up past
Jericho cross the Jordan just north of
the Dead Sea uh make a right head down
to Moab and get out of town
right back into the Wilder
away from
God doesn't seem
right but there's a famine he's
struggling and what I find funny is he
comes from be Bethlehem the Hebrew word
bleem bit meaning house meaning bread
the House of
Bread Jesus claims to be the bread of
life where was he born the House of
Bread kind of cool right but so they
leave they leave Bethlehem and they head
into Moab
verse two the man's name was
ELC his wife's name
Naomi and the names of his two sons were
Malon and kilon they were ephrathites
from Bethlehem Judah and they went to
mohab and lived there now elch Naomi's
husband died and she was left with her
two
sons and they married moabit woman one
named Ora and the other Ruth and after
they had lived there about 10 years
years both melon and kilan also died and
Naomi was left without her two sons and
her
husband now I know you all came thinking
this is going to be a wonderful
Christmas sermon but here has tragedy
and suffering to begin with and we'll
see how this this changes we'll see how
God uses this um because it's really
it's really cool but
uh her two sons their two sons married
moabit woman they're not Israelite women
they're stepping outside of the
Israelite tribe and God was God was
known for saying we're not doing that
that's not what we should be doing right
so not only have they left they've now
married moabit
woman elch has died and their two sons
have died and now you have
Naomi left with no sons and two
daughter-in-laws verse 6 when she heard
in Moab that the Lord had come to the
aid of his
people by providing food for them Naomi
and her daughters-in-law prepared to
return home from there with her two
daughters-in-law she left the place
where she had been living and set out on
the road that would take them back to
the land of Judah then Naomi said to her
two daughters-in-law go back each of you
to your mother's home may the Lord show
kindness to you as you have shown to the
to your dead and to me and may the Lord
grant that each of you will find rest in
the home of another husband I love that
she she has that word rest um in fact
there's a Hebrew word the uh menuka
which uh is rest and security and she
she she assimilates that to marriage
right to find that
rest but what I'm I'm I'm Amazed by
Naomi she's lost her husband and her two
sons and she's in a land she doesn't
really really
know I would be
miserable if I lost my wife and my my
future child and and I'm in a place
where I don't really know right and
we've all been through suffering like
this before we've all we've all suffered
that we we question what are you doing
God like where are we going with
this and so so often sometimes people
decide to turn away from God there's
this there's this point point where I
believe suffering
uh it makes you an honest
Christian you either walk away from God
or you lean into
him and and here we see
Naomi who's been through a horrible
horrible
time and her
response hey let's go back to where God
is let's lean in to where God is I love
this attitude because so often the
mindset that we have is why me why God
why would you do this to me I've been a
good
person I obey you I come to church I do
all this stuff and why
me and it's so easy for us to to turn
away from God and Naomi leans into
him that action let's
go and you see the love she has for her
daughters-in-law uh as we read on uh
verse 8 then Naomi said to her
daughters-in-law go back each of you to
your mother's home may the Lord show
kindness to you as you have shown to the
dead and to me and may the Lord grant
each of you uh sorry may the Lord grant
that each of you will find rest in the
home of another husband then she kissed
them they and they wept aloud and said
and said to her we will go back with you
to your people but Naomi said return
home my daughters why would you come
with me am I going to have uh any more
sons who could come who could become
your husband return home my daughters I
am too old to have another husband even
if I thought there was still hope for me
even if I had a husband tonight and then
gave birth to Sons would you wait until
they grew up kind of feel like there's
some sarcasm there would you remain
unmarried for them no my daughters it is
more bitter for me than for you you
because the Lord's hand has gone out
against me so you see this love that
Naomi has for her
daughter-in-laws go be with your people
go go find a go find a place go go find
a a happy life again because the Lord's
hand has gone out against me and at this
they wept again then Ora kissed her
mother-in-law goodbye but Ruth clung to
her look said Naomi your sister-in-law
is going back to her people and her Gods
go back with her but Ruth replied don't
urge me to leave you or to turn back
from you where you go I will go and
where you stay I will stay your people
will be my people and your God my God
where you die I will die and there I
will be buried may the Lord deal with me
be it ever so
severely if anything but death separates
you from me you and me
when when Naomi realized that Ruth was
determined to go with her she stopped
urging
her Ruth's name means friend
companion and at this moment a young a
young
woman who could easily have left her
mother-in-law who's been urged by her
mother-in-law to go she could have
gone but there's a loyalty that we see
in
ruthia that's un like uh it's unlike
many other stories I read where she's
willing to give up her people and her
God to go with
Naomi a woman who has just gone through
terrible suffering but hang on if your
God is so awesome and so powerful why
did you just lose your husband why did
you just lose your two
sons what kind of God is that
instead Ruth sees it from a different
perspective wow this is what's happened
to you and you're still going back to
God you see I think in times of our
struggle in times of our
suffering when we stand up and lean into
God when we when we turn back to God
people see
that and we're
proclaiming how amazing God
is because through our struggles we
still go back to
God and so Ruth sees this there's a
testimony from
Naomi by her
actions and Ruth sees this and realizes
how powerful this is to the point where
she says your people will be my people
and your God will be my God and may
God punish me basically if anything
other than death separates us
wow that's the testimony of
Naomi and the response by
Ruth so the two verse 19 so the two
women went on until they came to
Bethlehem and when they arrived in
Bethlehem the whole town was stirred
because of them and the woman exclaimed
can this be Naomi don't call me Naomi
cuz Naomi means pleasantness don't call
me Pleasant she told them call
Mara because the almighty has made my
life very
bter I went away full but the Lord has
brought me back
empty why call me Naomi the Lord has
Afflicted me the almighty has brought
Misfortune upon me have we ever spoken
like this
before what I love about
Naomi is that she's not bter towards
God right she knows that her life has
been made
better and she doesn't understand why or
maybe she thinks it's because they left
or maybe she thinks it's because her
son's married more by a
woman or maybe she messed up and we all
go down this path of well what have I
done maybe it's me maybe it's something
I did maybe it's something I didn't do
I'm being punished I'm being punished oh
my goodness
this is my
fault but we're going to see how this
story plays out because right now
Naomi has no idea what's
coming so Naomi returned to uh sorry
verse 22 so Naomi returned from
Moab accompanied by Ruth and Moab by
Tess her
daughter-in-law arriving in bethem as
The Barley Harvest was beginning in
chapter 2:s one now Naomi had a relative
on her husband's side when uh from the
clan of elac a man of standing whose
name was Boaz and Ruth the moates said
to Naomi let me go to the fields and
pick up the leftover grain behind anyone
in whose eyes I find favor and Naomi
said to her go ahead my daughter so she
went out and began to glean in the
fields behind the Harvesters as it
turned out she found herself working in
the field belonging to Boaz who was from
the clan of
ALC right do we think this was a happy
coincidence or do we start to see the
hand of God working
here because I'm I'm going to I'm going
to jump ahead a little bit you read the
book of Ruth and you don't really see
the writers saying well God did this and
God did that God is pretty much
Anonymous here and yet when we step back
we see God
working and so you've got
Boaz a relative on her husband's side
she doesn't know Boaz she's been in Moab
and she's arrived and now she's gone to
glean in the fields now gleaning in the
fields meant that uh she would go and
pick up behind those who were working
this is kind of like a social program
it's it's very clever God in Leviticus
says that you know when you glean the
fields kind of leave the corners out so
the people who are struggling can come
and get some food and it's not just a
handout it's they've got to come and
work for their food but at least there's
something for them it's pretty cool
social program I think so she's gone to
glean in the fields and it turns out
she's in boaz's
field coincidence right or God's way
remaining
Anonymous in verse four just then Boaz
arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the
Harvesters I love this I love this Boaz
morning everyone the Lord be with
you
and how do how do his workers reply to
him uh the Lord bless you they called
back I dare you next time you're at work
walk in and say good morning everyone
the Lord bless you the Lord may the Lord
be with
you yeah how many of us are are brave
enough to do
that and maybe your co-workers will be
like man Lord bless
you I love this man because that's how
he starts his day that's how he greets
people
right so the Lord be with verse 5 Boaz
asked the foreman of his Harvesters
whose young woman is that he's noticing
her the foreman replied she is the
moates who came back from Moab with
Naomi and she said please let me glean
and gather among the Sheep behind the
Harvesters and she went into the field
and has work steadily from morning till
now except for a short rest in the
shelter this tells me something about
Ruth her willingness to
work she's had a rough time but hey we
need to get up and we need to keep
going the suffering is terrible but we
got to get up and we got to keep going
and she's gone and she's worked hard but
more
so in Leviticus this this law that that
people could come and glean from the
fields was a
law but with Ruth she still gone and
asked if she can glean in the fields now
she could have just gone and done it but
the fact that her her personality or her
character takes her to the Workman and
says hey do you mind if I could glean in
your Fields tells me something about
Ruth
right so uh
verse where we verse eight so bo uh so
Bois said to Ruth my daughter listen to
me don't go and glean in another field
and don't go away from here
uh stay here with my servant girls watch
the field where the men are harvesting
and follow along after the girls I have
told these men not to touch you and
whenever you are thirsty go and get a
drink from the water jars the men have
filled at this she bowed with her face
uh as she bowed down with her face to
the ground and she exclaimed why have I
found such favor in your eyes that you
notice a notice me a foreigner
Boaz is providing protection
here some
rest and
refreshment verse 11 Boaz replied I have
been told all about what you have done
for your mother-in-law since the death
of your of your husband how you left
your father and mother and your Homeland
and came to live with a people you did
not know before and may the Lord pay you
for what you have done may you be richly
rewarded by the Lord the god of Israel
under whose wings you have come to take
refuge may I continue to find favor in
your eyes my Lord she said you have
given me Comfort and have spoken kindly
to your servant though I do not have the
standing of one of your servant girls at
Meal Time Boaz said to her come over
here have some bread and dip it in the
wine
vinegar okay so up to to this point we
see this interaction of Bo is getting to
know her he notices uh uh Ruth's work
ethic her pleasantness her um her
character and he's found out more
details about her and slowly we see this
growing and maybe just maybe this is a
point of a little bit of
romance come in and eat with
us gentlemen if you want to show romance
to a young woman take her on a dinner
take her out to dinner
right buy her the food she wants and
when she says she doesn't want chips but
she knows she's going to eat your chips
buy your chips and let her eat your
chips show a bit a little bit of
romance verse 14 have some bread and dip
it in the wine vinegar and when she sat
down with the harvested Harvesters he
offered her some roasted grain she ate
all she wanted and had some left over
and as as she got up to glean Boaz
orders gave orders to his men even if
she gathers among the sheaves don't
embarrass her rather pull out some
stalks from uh for her from the bundles
and leave them for her to pick up and
don't rebuke
her see what bz is doing here not to
dishonor
Ruth but to allow us some
dignity you know let her work for it but
help her out I love that verse 17 so
Ruth gleaned in the field until evening
then she threshed The Barley she had
gathered and it amounted to about an an
F uh which is about 22 L from my
understanding that's 11 2 L Coke bottles
everybody so she carried it back to town
and her mother-in-law saw how much she
had gathered Ruth also brought out and
gave her what she had left over after
she had eaten enough her Mother-in-law
asked her where did you glean today
where did you work blessed be the man
who took notice of you and then Ruth
told her mother-in-law about the one at
whose place she had been working the
name of the man I worked with today is
Boaz she said the Lord bless him Naomi
said to her daughter-in-law he has not
stopped showing his kindness to the
living and the dead she added that man
is our close relative he is one of our
Kingsmen
redeemers then Ruth and the Moab test
said he even said to me stay with my
workers until they finish harvesting all
my grain Naomi said to Ruth her
daughter-in-law it will be good for you
my daughter to go with his girls because
in someone else's field you might be
harmed so Ruth stayed close to the
servant girls of Boaz to glean until the
barley and the wheat Harvest were
finished and she lived with her
mother-in-law now the word
goel
uh represents a special family
representative a
Chieftain uh in in some ways this is a
Kingsman Redeemer a Kingsman Redeemer
had had a few responsibilities according
to levitical law uh one of which the
Kings man Redeemer was a generally was a
family member he uh he had the duty of
buying family members out of slavery and
we find that in in Leviticus 25 he had
the duty of buying back the land that
had been
forfeited so he's got this duty to to go
around and to make things right for the
people for his family
um he one of his responsibilities if
someone died was to
marry the that person and to continue
that name right so it seems a bit weird
to us that you go and marry your
sister-in-law to to keep the name going
or or a family member to keep the the
name
going but this is what was what was done
it we're going to see how this shows us
what Christ has done for us just we're
almost there so chapter 3 verse one one
day Naomi her mother-in-law said to her
my daughter should I not try to find a
home for you where you will be well
provided uh for is not Boaz with whose
servant girls you have been a Kingsman
of ours tonight he will be woning barley
on the threshing floor washing wash your
wash and perfume yourself
and put on your best clothes then go
down to the threshing floor but don't
let him know you are there until he has
finished eating and drinking when he
lies down note the place where he
is then go and uncover his feet and lie
down and he will tell you what to
do
so Naomi and Ruth are coming up with
this plan right our mother-in-laws are
scheming
right no okay so we see
Naomi is coming up with this plan and
she tells Ruth this is what you need to
go do and and Ruth's response is yes she
obeys her her mother-in-law right she
says I do whatever you say Ruth answered
so she went down to the threshing floor
and did everything her mother-in-law
told her to do and when Boaz had
finished eating and drinking and was in
good spirits he went over to lie down at
the far end of the gra the grain pile
now I would argue that this isn't
alcohol don't I wouldn't go down that
road I wouldn't say oh because he's in
good spirits that he was drinking no no
no the reason I say that is because when
they were when they were um harvesting
The Barley at this this point in time it
was often known that people would come
in and steal so you've got Boaz sleeping
the night on the threshing floor as
security and we do see this in in
scripture where the Philistines came
into the threshing floor and and and
stole stuff so you've got Boaz on high
alert he's uh he's he's now finished his
work and he's he's protecting the place
and he's he's laid down and Ruth
approached quietly uncovered his feet
and laid down in the middle of the night
something startled the man and he turned
and discovered a woman lying At His Feet
who are you he asked I am your servant
Ruth she said spread the corner of your
garment over me since you are a king's
Redeemer I'm going to stop here because
I've read a lot of uh different opinions
on this and a lot of people say well
this could have been a a sexual
thing it's not and you can say that and
I can show you in Ezekiel chapter 16:8
God covers Us with his cloak this and he
goes on to make this Covenant with us
this this covering is like a covenant
and so she's she's taking the the corner
cor of his feet and basically said you
know make this Covenant with me and he
realizes what she's
done in verse 9 it says I am your
servant Ruth she said spread your car
your the corner of your garment over me
since you are a kinsman redeemer the
Lord bless you my daughter he replied
this kindness is greater than which you
have uh which you have showed
earlier you have not run after the
younger men whether rich or poor and now
my daughter don't be afraid I will do
for you all you ask all my fellow
townsmen know that you are a woman of
noble character although it is true that
I am near of kin there is a Kingsman
Redeemer nearer than I stay here for the
night and in the morning if he wants to
redeem good let him redeem but if he is
not willing as surely as the Lord lives
I will do it lie here until
morning so she lay at his feet until
morning but got up before anyone could
be recognized
and he said don't let it be known that a
woman came to the threshing floor he
also said bring me the shaw you are
wearing and hold it out when she did so
he poured into it six measures of barley
and put it on her then he went back to
to
town when Ruth came to her mother-in-law
Naomi uh sorry when Ruth came to her
mother-in-law Naomi asked how did it go
my daughter then she told her everything
Boaz had done for her and added he gave
me these these six measures of barley
saying don't go back to your
mother-in-law empty-handed then noomi
said wait my daughter until you find out
what happens for the man will not rest
until the matter is settled today we see
here Boaz boaz's loyalty to do the right
thing to say hey there is someone closer
than I let's go and make this right
let's do the right thing we see
Integrity uh we see a man of of noble
character and not only that the word
that he uses to describe Ruth is uh hay
strength moral strength good quality
Integrity Valiant Valor
virtue it's almost like he he describes
her as a hero these words are used
throughout the Bible Valiant
Valor so we see two people with amazing
character so now we wait now we see what
BOS is going to do chapter 4 meanwhile
Boaz went up to the town gate and sat
there now the Town Gate was like the
courthouse you go up there because no
one had mobile phones so you went there
to catch the guy as he's coming back in
and you'd have a bunch of witnesses
around there and so when the king's been
redemer he had mentioned came along Boaz
said come over here my friend and sit
down so he went over and sat down Boz
took 10 of the Elders of the town and
said sit here and they did so then he
said to the kingsman Redeemer Naomi who
has come back from Moab is selling the
piece of land that belonged to our
brother ELC I thought I should bring the
matter to your attention and suggested
you buy it in the presence of these
seated here and in the presence of the
Elders of my people if you will uh if
you will redeem it do so but if you will
not tell me so that I will know for no
one has the right to do it except you
and I am next in line now this this is
this is good news someone comes to me
and says hey Keegan there's a business
opportunity to buy some land I'm like ah
sounds like a good deal right
mhm you see what BS is doing
here he's doing the right thing but
there's a bit of wisdom in how he's
doing
it and so uh the man says I will redeem
it he said now I wonder if Naomi and
Ruth were listening in here
I wonder if their hearts sunk like oh no
no no please maybe Ruth really wanted
Boaz then Boaz very quick on his feet he
said on the day that you buy the land
from Naomi and from Ruth the mo by Tess
you acquire the Dead Man's Widow in
order to maintain the name of the Dead
with his
property at this the kingsman Redeemer
said then then I cannot redeem it
because I might endanger my own estate
you redeem it yourself I cannot do
it what there's a catch there's a catch
to buying this land no no no whoa whoa
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa you you do
it you redeem it for yourself I cannot
do it verse 7 now in earlier times in
israels for the Redemption and the
transfer of property to become final one
party took off his sandal and gave it to
the
other this was mentioned uh this was a
method of legalizing transactions in
Israel
yep you read that right they took off
his
sandal and they would give it to the
other guy so the next time well when the
time comes that I got to hand over the
mantle of the youth minister to someone
else I'm going to take off my shoe I'm
going to give it to the other guy
right but if you read uh in
Deuteronomy if the kingsman Redeemer
doesn't
redeem not only is he taking his sandal
off but the lady who this is about was
to spit in his
face it's kind of fun
right but this seems to be
more more of an honorable way of of what
what they were doing so all they do is
he takes his shoe off and he gives it to
to Boaz so the king's been Redeemer said
to Boaz buy it yourself and he removed
his sandal then Boaz announced to the
elders and all the people today you are
witnesses that I have brought from Naomi
all the property of el kilon and melon I
have also acquired Ruth the moabites
melon's Widow as my wife in order to
maintain the name of the Dead with this
property so that his name will not
disappear from among his family or from
the town records today you are witnesses
then the elders and all those at the
gates said we Are Witnesses and they
blessed them listen here may the Lord
make the woman who is coming into your
home like Rachel and Leah who together
built up the house of Israel may you
have standing uh in EPA and be famous in
Bethlehem though Through The Offspring
of the Lord gives you by this young
woman may your family be that of Perez
whom Tamar bore to
Judah so boes took Ruth and she became
his wife then he went to her and the
Lord enabled her to conceive and she
gave birth to a
son the woman said to Naomi praise be to
the Lord who this day has not left you
without a Kingsman Redeemer may he be
become famous throughout Israel he will
renew your life and sustain you in your
old age for your daughter-in-law who
loves you and who is better to you than
seven sons has given him birth then
Naomi took the child laid him in her lap
and cared for him the woman living there
said Naomi has a son and they named him
OED he was the father of Jesse the
father of
David
2,000 years
ago a young baby was
born and we all we're going to celebrate
that
tomorrow but it's not just about a baby
being
born it's about a Kingsman Redeemer
coming into the world the story that we
see points towards
Christ the idea that the kingsman
Redeemer was a family me remember we see
in Hebrews 2:11 Jesus is not ashamed to
call us brothers and sisters and Jesus
added Humanity to his eternal deity so
that he could become Kingsman our
Kingsman and save
us the kingsman redem had the duty of
buying family members out of
slavery Jesus redeemed Us From
Slavery the kingsman Redeemer had the
duty of buying back the land that's
forfeited well Jesus know not come
back and redeem the Earth that we sold
over to
Satan the Kings and Redeemer took his
bride took her
bride we are known as Jesus's
bride he's our Kingsman
Redeemer we see Boaz was not motivated
by self-interest but motivated by love
for Ruth I would argue that Jesus's
motivation for redeeming us is his great
love for us
Boaz a Kingsman Redeemer to Ruth had had
to have a plan to redeem Ruth unto
himself and some might have thought the
plan was
foolish because sometimes we look at the
cross of and and what happened there we
think what in the
world but Jesus had a plan to redeem
us and his plan worked and it's
glorious Boaz redeemed Ruth he provided
a glorious Destiny for
Ruth Jesus our Kingsman Redeemer
provides a glorious destination for
us so in conclusion three points that
came out of this this story
Naomi her heart the heart that we have
the emotional side of suffering and
tragedy when faced with this terrible
suffering Naomi didn't run from God she
leaned into to
God my lesson that I took from Naomi is
that we need to lean into God when times
are tough we need to be that example
that preaches to the world that even
when we're struggling God is our number
one Ruth the head the to to to logically
think things
through was faced with a decision to
stay on the path of suffering or to go
back to her people which seems
easier but she's persuaded by the
Loyalty of her
mother-in-law to God your God will be my
God and not only that she gets to
work she she shows kindness
respectfulness she's humble in nature
and she leans into
God Boaz I like to think of the hand as
a a practical matter Boaz lives his life
with honor and integrity I love this man
so much so that I said to Vick we should
call our new our son Boz but she's not
too happy about that one but I like it
he does what is right he's caring he's
kind he's respectful he's loving he
shows wisdom blessed be
God he greets people by saying the Lord
greet you or the Lord bless
you he leans in to
God the Curious Thing here is that God
is not really mention mention in this
book but these people show us that God
is working and weaving together this
amazing design that he has for us and
and and going back to Naomi she's in
that position where she doesn't know
what's coming she is dealing with
suffering right here and she doesn't
know what God's about to do and I guess
the Heavenly hosts are all looking down
going wow look at what God's
doing well we think is weakness God says
let me show
you so in this mundane life and we all
live mundane
lives God is
working he's doing something I don't
know what he's going to do I don't know
what's going to happen in five days time
we're going through a bit of suffering
right now Vic and I I don't know what's
going to happen in 5 days time maybe I
turn around and go yeah that was pretty
cool maybe I do that in a year's time or
maybe that doesn't happen in my lifetime
maybe I'm standing in heaven one day
going wow that was
cool it's amazing what God has
done so how do we lean into God here's
the lesson within the
lesson read our
Bibles I know we've read four chapters
today it took us about 30 30 minutes
sorry 35
minutes read our Bibles ladies and
gentlemen when we need perspective on
what we're going through
God gives us that perspective my
Christmas
wish is that we read our Bibles
more three to four chapters a day you'll
get through the whole Bible in a
year 30 minutes 30 minutes a day you'll
get through the whole Bible in a year I
promise you this will change your
life my final story the um when I was a
minister in Australia for a small
congregation I had no idea what I was
doing I did not go to school to study
theology I had no clue why God had put
me in this position it was a wild roller
coaster ride but here I am with this
congregation looking at me so what we
did we just started reading Bible it's
all we did for one year we read 22
books word for word like we just did
today and I saw people's lives change
there was a man who was so
Ultra Ultra difficult I love him speaks
like this but he had some some strong
opinions and one day he came to me and
he said Keegan I must tell you you've
changed the way I've been thinking about
things and I laughed and I said mate you
realize it's not me I haven't done
anything but all we did is just
read God changes Our Lives he'll help
you through suffering he'll redeem
you and that's all I want I just want to
be with God
Amen if you need Christ uh today is a
good day to do that if you need him
there are people here we can study with
you we can help you come forward if
you're going through a tough time and
need the prayers of the congregation
come forward uh bless you all and and
let's let's have a good week let's stand
and as we sing
thanks
