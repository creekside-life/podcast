morning come to
the portion of our worship service set
aside to take
communion I'm going to be reading from
the ninth
chapter of the book of
Nehemiah yeah uh I'll read verses
16-9 and then verses 26 and
27 this is recounting after
the people have been LED out of the
bondage of Egypt and how God has blessed
them and they stumble and so I thought
it was appropriate for this morning but
they and our fathers acted proudly
hardened their necks and did not heed
your Commandments they refused to obey
and they were not mindful of your
Wonders that you did among them but they
hardened their necks and in their
Rebellion they appointed a leader to
return to their bondage but you are God
ready to Pardon gracious and merciful
slow to anger abundant in in kindness
and did not forsake them even when they
made a molded calf for themselves and
said this is your god that brought you
out of Egypt and worked great
provocations yet in your manifold
mercies you did not forsake them in the
wilderness the pillar of the cloud did
not depart from them by day to lead them
on the road nor the pillar of Fire by
night to show them light and the way
that they should
go drop to verse
26 nevertheless they were disobedient
and rebelled against you cast your law
behind their backs and killed your
prophets who testified against them to
turn them to yourself and they worked
great provocations
therefore you delivered them into the
hands of their enemies who oppressed
them and in the time of their trouble
when they cried to you you heard from
heaven and according to your abundant
mercies you gave them deliverers who
saved them from the hand of their
enemies when we're called here this
morning to take
communion this is to focus us
on God providing us with an eternal
deliverer the days of bringing a
sacrifice to the altar to pay for the
sins over and over and over that was
imperfect because of us so to glorify
himself God sent his son to provide us
with a sacrifice that is good for all
eternity for all who will accept it so
when we
are when we lose lose our Focus don't
lose hope and that Focus being trying to
live a a Godly
life not sin not
stumble that's going to happen but don't
lose your hope even if you've lost your
focus when you come here understand that
that blood of Christ renews you again
today regardless of what happened this
past week and take that with you into
next week if you would pray with
me Father God we're so thankful for your
mercy and your love for us that you
sought to send your son to be our
sacrifice and to die upon that cross
father as we take this bread
representing the body of Christ as our
sacrifice may we do it with Humble
Hearts focused on your forgiveness and
mercies and father we pray these things
in the name of Jesus
amen
for
e
for
you would join me in prayer for the
fruit of the
vine father God we thank you for your
Eternal wisdom that we would need a
savior and that you would be willing to
provide him and father we thank you for
your Eternal
wisdom that we would need to be
focused reminded
continually of your love and the
sacrifice of your
son and father God finally we are
thankful for the power in the blood of
Christ that was shed to provide a flow
that will eternally and continually
ually cleanse us of our sins because we
are not perfect father but you are and
your
son obedient unto
death the perfect sacrifice for the sins
of the world father we thank you we ask
for forgiveness of our
sins we praise your holy
name and we pray all these things in the
name of your risen son and our Savior
Jesus Christ amen
for
e
for
good
morning at this time we continue our
worship by giving as the Lord has
prospered
us last week I read about how a lot of
people from around the world write
letters addressed to God and for some
reason many of those letters end up at a
post office in
Jerusalem since they don't really know
how to deliver those letters um they
just them for
fun in one letter A man asked God for
5,000 shekels that's about $11,000 for
us because things were really hard for
him
financially postal workers were so moved
by his situation that they decided to
send him the money
themselves they couldn't come up with
the entire 5,000 uh but it was close
they ended up sending him about 4,300
shekels so 700 less than what he asked
for
po after a month the same person wrote
to God
again this time he wrote thank you God
for the
contribution but the next time don't
send it through these postal workers
they're
thieves they stole 700
shekels
H are we really truly thankful for what
we have and do we recognize the
blessings in our lives but more more
importantly do we think more about the
giver than the
gifts in Luke 16: 13-1 15 the Bible
reads no servant can serve two masters
for either he will hate the one and love
the other or else he will be devoted to
one and despise the other you cannot
serve God in
wealth now the Pharisees who were lovers
of money were listening to all these
things and were SC laughing at him and
he said to them you are those who
justify yourselves in the sight of men
but God knows your hearts for that which
is highly esteemed among men is
detestable in the sight of
God what's more highly esteemed in this
world than
money we have to be so careful to guard
our hearts from falling in love with and
obsessing over
money because if we have a lot it's easy
to fall in love with the things that we
can do and the things that we can buy
and how it makes us
feel and if we don't have a lot it's
easy to only focus on the
hardships and in both cases we can fall
into the Trap of obsessing over just
wanting more if I could just have a
little bit
more so what's the
antidote how can we be sure that we're
not mocking the Lord like the Pharisees
that we're not highly esteeming that
which God
hates while the instructions that are
given to the rich apply to us all in 1
Timothy 6: 17-18 the Bible reads
instruct those who are rich in this
present world not to be conceited or to
set their Hope on the uncertainty of
riches but on God who richly supplies us
with all things to enjoy instruct them
to do good
to be rich in good works and to be
generous and ready to
share let's keep this in mind as we go
to our father in
prayer dear father in Heaven dear Lord
we honor you and praise you father Lord
we thank you for all that you are and
all that you do for every blessing that
you've sent our way father we thank
you Lord we pray that we will always
keep our hope in you that whether we
have a lot or a little father we will
always trust in you and father help us
to always give uh with a cheerful heart
Lord father we pray that the money
that's collected today will be used in a
way that will honor you and glorify you
father Lord we thank you for all that
you are and all that you do we love you
we thank you for loving us in Jesus name
we pray
amen
for
let's Stand Together As we sing this
song and please remain standing for the
scripture reading that will
follow
faith of our
fathers
living
still in spite of
D fire and
sword oh how our hearts beat high with
joy when
we that
glor
