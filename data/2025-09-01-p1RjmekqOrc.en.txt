First Kings, you might want to look at
this. This is New American Standard
Version. First Kings chapter 19 11
through13.
And I call your attention to verse 12 if
you just want to go straight there. But
I'm going to start in verse 11. Behold,
the Lord was passing by. You remember
this is when Elijah had fled from uh
Jezebel.
She wanted to kill him and had that
great moment up on the mountain. But now
he's in fear for his life
and he's wondering why the Lord's left
him such. He says, "Behold, the Lord was
passing by, and a great and strong wind
was rending the mountains and breaking
in pieces the rocks before the Lord, but
the Lord was not in the wind."
and after the wind and earthquake,
but the Lord was not in the earthquake.
Verse 12, and after the earthquake of
fire, but the Lord was not in the fire.
And after the fire, a sound of a gentle
blowing.
Yeah, that's different than the King
James.
Sound of a gentle blowing. That's
literally what it says. Verse 13.
When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his
face in his mantle and went out and
stood in the entrance of the cave.
Behold, a voice came to him and said,
"What are you doing here, Elijah?"
He was in the Harat,
a rough area in Saudi Arabia near Kyber
when he heard a gentle blowing,
gentle breeze. Oswald Chambers,
who lived until 1917,
is famous for having written My Utmost
for His Highest. Many of you have read
that or used it in your daily studies.
If you've never used it, I highly
recommend it. Oswald Chambers, My Most
for His Highest. It's probably the most
popular Christian book ever written.
More people have probably read it. It's
a daily devotional, but he didn't
publish it. His widow after he had
passed took his sermons and had it
developed in 1924.
And one of those writings which is on
quench not the spirit. First
Thessalonians 5:19 says this, "The voice
of the spirit is as gentle as a zephr."
Zephr is a breeze, just in case you
don't know. So the voice of the spirit
is as gentle as a breeze. so gentle that
unless you are living in perfect
communion with God, you never hear it.
The checks of the spirit come in the
most extraordinary gentle way. And if
you're not sensitive enough to detect
his voice, you will quench it and your
personal spiritual life will be
impaired. His texts are always come as a
still small voice. So small that no one
but the disciples noticed them.
Carl Bobberg
who died in 1940 lived in the 1800s
predominantly was a Swedish minister and
he wrote a song in Swedish if you will.
It was then translated into German
and then it was translated into Russian
and then a fellow named Stuart Hind who
was English who's a British missionary
in Russia
heard the song in Russian in 1923.
The Russian rendition was a little hard
to translate. So he was deeply moved by
it because he understood Russian and he
rewrote it and then re-ransated it back
into English.
It was then republished in 1949. You see
how many it's gone through now. And then
in 1957,
George Beverly Sheay
found it.
And at one of the Billy Graham ministry
things y'all probably seen on TV a few
times if you were growing up. He sang it
and nobody in America had ever heard it
before.
Here's some of the words. Maybe you'll
recognize it. When through the woods and
forest glades I wonder. I hear the birds
sing sweetly in the trees.
When I look down from lofty mountain
grandeur and hear the brook and feel the
gentle breeze,
then sings my soul. My savior God to
thee, how great thou art. How great thou
art. Then sings my soul, my savior God
to thee. How great thou art. How great
thou art. That's where it comes from all
over the place. But apparently people
all over the world had already caught
the concept of it. This gentle breeze
that I want to talk to you about
is ultimately the discussion point. The
antiian fathers talked a great deal
about it. So this is something that's
been discussed a lot. So you might be
thinking, well, what in the world is
this about? Well, it's something been
discussed quite a bit. It's the idea of
a manifestation of divine littleness.
like a fragrance that you just get a
whiff of.
It's conducive to the idea of calm
contemplation of God.
It's to illustrate the idea of the
divine impulse of the spirit being so
subtle it almost is unnoticed. It's a
pleasant air in a garden of Gethsemane
of peace and enhancing the setting. It
may it may be felt or it may be smelt.
It's a pleasant atmosphere
aiding a tranquil contemplation of God.
You know, nothing gets your attention
like a storm
or a violent wind. We've been through
hurricanes, right?
You've wondered what was going to happen
next
because it shook you.
A violent wind gets your attention. In
fact, almost everybody in a violent
enough wind, even if you don't believe
in God, starts praying to God. God can
get your attention with a violent wind.
What he can't get your attention with
seemingly is a calm, gentle breeze. You
see, that's not what the world's looking
for. They're looking for pizzazz.
They're looking for bolts of lightning.
That's what most Christians are looking
for. I want to see him do something big,
brother Dutton.
But what about just a gentle breeze?
He comes in a gentle wind.
It invigorates us when we get it. You're
hot outside, been mowing. A little cool
breeze. It's worth the world, isn't it?
So, a gentle breeze of God's leading is
a choice that we allow God to lead us by
things that are not being noticed by
other people. Are you noticing the
things that others aren't noticing?
Let me give you a second thought here.
We're shown the father by these gentle
breezes. And I want to show you just a
few things that the father shows you
every day.
And in every way, we are ignoring them
if we're not careful. In these gentle
breezes, he shows us first and foremost
his sovereignty. I just want to take you
to one verse. Go back to John chapter 3
and look at verse 8 again. Look at what
it says again. The wind blows where it
wishes. What the wind is a mind?
It goes where it wishes. What is he
speaking of? See, he's saying that
people don't control the wind. We don't
control the storms. We don't control
what's going on outside. None of us have
that ability. But when God moves, God
does.
You see, the gentle wind shows us that
we serve a sovereign father.
In Job 37:es 9 through13, it says this,
"For the chambers of the south comes the
whirlwind and cold from the scattering
winds of the north." Verse 10, "By the
breath of God, ice is given, and the
broad waters are frozen. He saturates
the thick clouds. He shatters his bright
clouds and they swirl about. He turns
and they're turned by his guidance that
they may be do whatever he commands them
on the face of the whole earth. He
causes it to come whether for correction
from the land or for mercy. I was
preaching this verse in South Africa one
time and a lady came up to me and says
you don't think we're so ignorant as we
believe that God controls the weather. I
said I'm too smart for that. So I simply
said to her you must not be as smart as
you think you are.
That was to a sister in the church. Yes,
I will say that to you if you say stuff
like that because this is what it says.
And that means Psalm 137:7 also means
what it says. He causes the vapors to
ascend. He makes lightning for the rain
and he brings the wind out of the
treasures. He controls the wind. Psalm
148:8, snowy clouds, stormy winds,
fulfilling his word. You mean the wind
fulfills God's word? Absolutely.
Ecclesiastes 11:5, you do not know what
is the way of the wind. Oh boy, isn't
that true. You've never seen it in your
entire life. You've never seen the wind.
You don't have any control over it
whatsoever. He is the king of the wind.
He's the sovereign God and the gentle
breezes he controls. I think it's an
important concept to catch on to that we
serve a sovereign God even in a gentle
breeze. So what would make you think
that he doesn't control the spirit of
God and whether or not it's coming to
you today or not? What would make you
think that?
Annne Alexander tells the story about
during the depression in the 1930s. She
said that my husband preached for a very
small church. Uh, and we were good if we
got $10 a week. That was a great week.
One day we found ourselves out of bread
with only some rancid bacon grease for
shortening, nothing else. I used it in
making some biscuits and we managed to
eat some for lunch
and later we put the remaining biscuits
uh on the table for supper. That was it.
That's all they had. Their 5-year-old
daughter prayed very earnestly in this
prayer. Dear Jesus, help us to eat these
biscuits
or else send us some better ones. Amen.
And later that evening, the doorbell
rang.
At the door stood one of their members
who had a bakery route. He didn't own
the bakery. He just had a bakery route.
And before we could tell him what had
just happened with us, he started
unloading a large bakery basket with all
kinds of sweet rolls, buns, biscuits,
dark and white bread. Then he began to
speak. You know, I was tired tonight
and seven miles out here in the pouring
rain seemed so far.
I was tempted to wait until tomorrow
evening and breathe these break bakery
things on my way to prayer meeting as I
usually do.
But I was strongly constrained
to come here tonight.
I hope you can use these things.
or send us some better ones. A little
five-year-old parade.
Romans 8:14, led of the spirit. That's a
real thing.
Romans 8:28, all things work together
for good. That's real.
If he can move the wind, my fellow
Christian,
he can move my heart and he can move
yours.
Are we shown the father? Yes. By the
general breeze. Yes. Because he's the
king. He's the sovereign. He is in
control of it all.
Number two,
we are shown the father by a gentle
breeze of sensitivity. Listen to what it
goes on to say
and you hear the sound of it.
Have you ever noticed when you're
outside? Now, right now, this make a lot
of noise. You'll be lucky to hear me in
a minute. But bottom line is when you're
outside and a gentle breeze comes by,
there's almost no sound.
Have you noticed that? It almost makes
nothing. It's unlikely that you'll hear
anything except maybe a leaf,
maybe something small, but nothing
significant. It will be quiet. The
gentle wind shows. What was Elijah was
in that ch What did he hear? He heard
almost nothing. Why? Because the wind
goes by a building. It howls.
But when it's gentle, you don't hear the
wind come past the house. You don't hear
it come past you. You, if you hear real
close, maybe you hear a little
of and that's it.
The gentle wind shows us the gentle,
sensitive father we have.
Are you hearing me? He is a gentle
father. And he's very sensitive. Matthew
11:15,
he who has ears to hear, let him hear.
Let me tell you something. We've quit
having ears to hear. We're not even
looking for the finger of God in our
life. a little less listening for to try
to see where he's doing. We don't even
believe in that stuff anymore. We don't
even believe that this rain that's going
on out there, he has any hand in that.
We don't believe that anymore.
Matthew 11 and 29, take my yoke upon you
and learn from me, for I am gentle and
lowly in heart, and you'll find rest for
your soul. Nothing like having a glass
of tea after you finish mowing and a
little breeze comes along while you're
sitting out on the porch.
It is the little things that I'm afraid
we're missing. We're not paying
attention. In Matthew 21:5,
behold, your king is coming to you lowly
or gentle and sitting on a donkey coat,
a fo of a donkey. He's gentle.
He's not big and boisterous. You almost
don't notice him.
Romans 11:17, "Faith comes by hearing,
but are you hearing?
Are you listening?
Are you paying attention? Or does God
have nothing to do with you in your
life?" There's a professor from a Bible
college was vacationing with his wife in
Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Everybody been to
Gatlinburg? Tourist trap, right?
Gatlinburg. Well, this was ways back.
This is back in the 60s in the 70s. So,
it wasn't quite the tourist trap then.
And one morning, they were eating
breakfast there along one of those
creeks, as you know what it's like if
you've ever been there. And they saw
this distinguished looking white-haired
man start approaching and he'd been
going around talking to various people
in the room. Okay. So, he said, "Oh, I
hope he doesn't come over here. We we've
got our breakfast going. I don't want to
see him. I hope he doesn't come. But
sure enough, he came over to their
table. Said, "Where are you folks from?"
So, we're from Oklahoma.
Great to have you here in Tennessee. By
the way, Tennessee won, didn't they?
Alabama didn't. Okay. I know you were
waiting on that. What What are What are
you doing for a living? And he finally
handed me. He says, "Well, I work for a
Bible college."
Says, "So, oh, so you teach preachers
how to preach, do you?" "Well, I've got
a really great story for you." And he's
going, "Oh, no. Not another preacher
story, right?"
And so, he pulled up a chair and sat
down. And here's the story he told. See
that mountain over there?
Not far from the base of that mountain,
there was a boy born to an unwed mother.
He had a hard time growing up because
every place he went, he was always asked
the same question. Hey boy, who's your
daddy?
Where he was at school and the grocery
store or drugstore, people would ask the
same question. Who's your daddy?
He would hide at recess and lunch from
other students. He would avoid going
into stores because that question hurt
him so bad. When he was about 12 years
old, a new preacher came to his church.
He would always go in late and slip out
early to avoid hearing the question,
"Who's your daddy?"
But one day, the new preacher said the
benediction so fast that he got caught
off guard and had to walk out with a
crowd.
Just about the time he got to the back
door, the new preacher, not knowing
anything about him, put his hand on his
shoulders and asked him, "Son, who's
your daddy?"
The whole church got deadly quiet. He
could feel every eye in the church
looking at him. Now everyone would
finally know the answer to the question,
"Who's your daddy?"
This new preacher though sensed the sin
situation around him and used some
discernment that only the Holy Spirit
could give. And he said the following to
that scared little boy. Wait a minute.
I know who you are. I see the family
resemblance now. You're a child of God.
With that, he patted the boy on his
shoulders and said, "Boy, you got a
great inheritance.
Go and claim it."
With that, the boy smiled for the first
time in a long time, and walked out the
door, a changed person. He was never the
same again. Whenever anybody asked him,
"Who's your daddy?"
He'd just tell him, "I'm a child of
God."
that distinguished gentleman got up from
the table and walked away. Before he
went away, he said, "Ain't that a great
story?"
And the professor from the Bible college
said,
"It is."
He said, "You know, if that new preacher
hadn't told me that I was one of God's
children,
I probably never would have amounted to
anything."
And then he walked away.
Professor turned to his wife said, "That
really was a great story." But do you
know who that man is? No. Turned to the
lady waiting on their table and said,
"Do you know who that is?" And she said,
"Of course, everybody knows him. That's
Ben Hooper. He's former president uh
governor of Tennessee
from 1911 to 1915.
Romans 8:16 says, "The spirit does
testify with our spirit that we are
children of God."
If I can hear and I can feel a gentle
wind, maybe I can hear a gentle message.
You're his child.
I just think we need to listen for it
and look for it. You come to church
today, you need to hear you're not a
nobody. You're not a nothing.
You matter.
Number three, we're shown the father by
a gentle breeze of mystery. It goes on
to say, as you see there, but cannot
tell where it comes from and where it's
going. You know, people,
without that gentle breeze, we we really
don't know the truth. There's so much we
don't know. It wouldn't fill a book.
It'd fill worlds.
The gentle wind shows us the mysterious
father. Our father is mysterious. We
don't know so much. We sometimes act
like we know so much and we don't know
anything. Well, maybe you know a lot
compared to the people standing around
you. I'm not even sure if you should say
that cuz it's probably don't know
something that they know. I mean,
everybody in the room is fairly decent
brain and knows some stuff, but you
still don't know much, do you? So much I
don't know. But when it comes to the
father and what God can do, we sing that
song, it is no secret what God can do.
But I think actually it is a secret and
we don't know what he can do.
Genesis 28:16, "The Lord is in this
place and I did not know it." Did you
know the Lord was in this place and you
acted like this morning you didn't know
it? You sat here through this whole
thing thinking it was all about a lesson
or a song or something and the Lord was
here the whole time and you acted like
you didn't even know it because some of
the things you've done and said and
thought and what you're doing right now
expresses you don't even think he's
here.
Exodus 34:29, Moses did not know that
the skin of his face shone. God does
stuff and we don't know what he's doing
all the time. And Judges 16:20, he did
not know the Lord had departed from him.
That Samson didn't even know it. Hosea
11:3, they did not know that I healed
them. How many people have been healed
and didn't even know it was the Lord
that did it?
didn't even know.
In the frigid waters near Greenland,
there are all kinds of icebergs. In
fact, there's giant ones. You get around
Greenland and then there's little ones.
And there's an interesting thing that
happens in parts of Greenland off the
coast is you'll see giant icebergs
moving one direction
and you'll see the little bitty ones
moving another direction.
That's kind of interesting, isn't it?
How's that happen? Well, apparently the
little bitty ones are being blown by a
gentle breeze. They're moved along.
They're just little things. They're on
the top of the water like an ice cube,
and they're just moving along on the top
of the water, say east, and then these
big giant things bigger, way bigger than
this building, are moving west.
How's that happen? Well, apparently the
currents down deep affect the big things
and the wind
will affect the little things. Maybe
that's a truth about all of us. Maybe
what's really happening is the people
who think they're big boys are being
carried along by the currents of this
world down deep. But the people who know
they're little are affected by the
gentle breezes of God and are moving in
the exact opposite direction. You being
moved by the gentle breezes or you being
run by culture? Is the culture deciding
how you dress? Is it deciding how you
think? Is it deciding who you believe,
who you vote for, what you think? Is
that what's really happening? Do you
really think you're that independent?
Why don't you come and get along with
the gentle breeze? And you might be
surprised that you think differently
than you thought before.
A gentle breeze. You see, if the gentle
breeze can move me in the opposite
direction of everybody on this planet,
maybe I'm actually listening.
Maybe the mystery is becoming clearer.
God moves in mysterious ways as wonders
to performed. That's true. Plants his
footsteps on the sea. He can ride upon
the storm. That's all true.
Psalm 139:6,
such knowledge is too wonderful for me.
Quit acting like you think you know
something. Be a little more humble. Be
that little piece of ice being moved by
the spirit of God in the direction he's
moving you. Quit thinking like you think
you're so deep. Be a little more humble.
We're shown the father in a gentle
breeze of his mystery. Not in the big
flowing I'm one of them. Yeah.
Number last.
We're shown the father by the gentle
breeze of authenticity. Look at the last
thing. So is everyone who's born of the
spirit. There is such a thing as being
born of the spirit. It's real. It's
authentic. It's not a joke. We don't
play with this. This is serious. People
without this gentle breeze of the spirit
are not born again. Listen to And we'll
say it again. If you're not being moved
by the gentle breeze of the spirit, you
are not born again. See, the Holy Spirit
changes us. And if you think he's not
involved, you are not born again. Listen
to me. It isn't a case of just repenting
of your sins, confessing Christ, and
being baptized. You must be born again.
That means the spirit of God comes to
live within you. That means you are more
sensitive to what God is trying to push
you along to. And you're not such a big
shot anymore.
John 6 and verse 44, no one can come to
me unless the father draws him. There is
an authentic draw.
John 7:17, if anyone wants to do his
will, he shall know concerning the
doctrine, whether it's from God or I
speak on my own authority. John 10:3, he
calls his own sheep by name and leads
them out. There really is a leading. 1
Corinthians 3:6, I planted Apollos
water, but God gave the increase. People
come to God because God gives the
increase.
God gives it.
John, Dr. John Hutton
tells of a workman that had been a
drunken repbate. Some of you don't know
anything about that world. Never seen
it. God bless you. I'm grateful for you.
But this reprobate was converted.
But because he worked in kind of a rough
business construction, his workmates did
their best to make him feel like a fool
that he'd come to Christ.
So they said to him, "Surely
you can't believe in miracles
and things like
water being turned into wine. Surely you
couldn't possibly believe that."
And they'd mock him. "Do you believe
that water could be turned into wine?"
And the man would answer,
"I don't know
whether he turned water into wine when
he was in Palestine,
but I do know that in my own house and
in my own home, the Lord has turned beer
into furniture."
1 Timothy 1:16. I know we apply it to
Paul, but I want to tell you something.
I want you to apply it to yourself cuz
it definitely applies to me.
I obtain mercy
as a pattern
to those who would believe on the Lord
through me.
Now think of it. Say it with yourself.
I obtain mercy
as a pattern
for those who would believe on the Lord
through me. That if the Lord could find
grace to pull me out from where I was
raised,
Lord save you.
Lord save anybody. He can pull you out,
folks. That gentle breeze will change
you around. our family changed.
You know why I'm preaching today?
Because I know that's authentic.
That's where I was raised. And the Lord
got me out of that. Praise God. Now,
whether you believe that or not, I don't
really care. But I will tell you if you
did believe it, if you just recognize
that God can turn beer into furniture,
it change you. His gentle breeze changes
us all. It's just a lesson. That's all
there is. I don't really have anything
fancy here at the end. The apostles saw
Jesus every day and yet they asked,
"Lord, show us the father." You know,
that's that's because you can be around
it all the time. um these gentle breezes
and never see it. Oh Lord,
if I could just get you, I don't care
who you are. I don't care. If I could
just get you to think for just a moment,
maybe I'm not seeing it.
Maybe I'm not looking.
Maybe I'm not been sensitive to it.
Eugene Peterson
died in 2018. Uh he was a Presbyterian
preacher. I think
uh he wrote books. He's a poet.
Actually, he told a story about when he
went to Yellowstone Park. Y'all, some of
y'all been to Yellowstone.
He was there with his wife and his three
children. And he wrote about, he says he
was, as my family and I were walking
into a mountain meadow in Yellowstone
Park, there was a little boy, a four or
five about 30 yards out in the meadow
picking exquisite alpine flowers. It is
against the rules to pick the flowers in
the national parks. I was outraged. So I
yelled at him, "Don't pick the flowers."
He just stood wideeyed, innocent, and
terrified. He dropped all the flowers
and started crying. You can imagine what
happened next. My wife and children,
especially my children, were all over
me. Daddy, what you did was far worse
than what he did. He was just picking a
few flowers and you yelled. You scared
him. You ruined him. He's probably going
to have that to go for counseling when
he gets older, even when he's 40ome
years old.
But he said, "You know, my children were
right.
You can't yell people into holiness.
I can't wave my arms and yell and you
become a Christian.
It comes when you see the gentle breeze
yourself.
You get a glimpse of the Lord yourself.
I don't need a hurricane to believe in
Jesus.
And I got to stop trying to be the
hurricane in my life.
Stop it.
Stop thinking you got to fix everything
around you. Stop it. Stop it. Stop
yelling at everybody. Quit telling
everybody how wrong they are. Stop it.
Stop it.
Show them a gentle breeze.
If you see it, you'll see the father
and nobody will have to invite you.
You'll know what you need to do next.
Like right now as we stand and as we
sing.
