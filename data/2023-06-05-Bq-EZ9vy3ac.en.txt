good evening brothers and sisters
pardon me while I just get set up here
while I'm doing this I invite you to
open your Bibles to Luke 3 the passage
that was just read for us by our brother
Sager
I'm gonna
project the way that I was
in the auditorium class that I just did
I appreciate Matthew and Heath and Anna
allowing me to do it that way
while you're turning there and while I'm
just getting the last bit of my laptop
set up here I want to thank Rex and the
elders for inviting me to speak to you
tonight
this evening it's very simple we're just
going to be walking through a portion of
Luke's gospel in Luke chapter 3.
this is a portion of text that hit me
actually very similar to what Trent
talked about this morning
where he talked about how when you're
studying God's word you know some of the
best material just comes from the
Overflow of those things that you're
studying and so as I Was preparing for
my class on reading the gospels as
narratives
this text I don't even remember why I
was looking at this portion of text but
it struck me and there are some things
in this text that I think are very
challenging
but that we need to hear
and so that's what I'd like to speak to
you tonight
so again just turning your Bibles to
Luke 3 and we will get started here
momentarily I'm not a good multitasker
so I'm trying to talk while I do this at
the same time my wife will tell you that
is a recipe for disaster difficult for
me there we go like I like to focus on
one thing at a time
approximately 2 000 years ago
somewhere along this river that you see
on the screen
a mysterious prophetic figure showed up
and who he was known for immersing
people in water in this River
and Luke tells us some things about this
man that are very important and if
you're like me John the Baptist is
somebody who is a little he's just a
mysterious figure somebody that at least
in my Christian walk in my experience
I never really had given him a whole lot
of thought he was just kind of a warm-up
act before Jesus came on the scene
and yet Luke gives us
more words from John the Baptist than
Matthew and Martin do
and there's some things that John says
here in this portion of text that are
going to establish some very important
ideas that Luke will then Trace through
and that Jesus will pick up on and
extend
now let's start with what Luke tells us
in these opening verses of chapter three
so again we're just walking through the
text tonight
and we're just going to unpack the
things that Luke is telling us so go
with me to Luke 3. let's read again
these verses that Sager just read to us
because there's some very important
things Luke is getting across here so
that we understand who this John the
baptizer is
so Luke chapter 3 starting in verse 1.
in the 15th year of the reign of
Tiberius Caesar
Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea
and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee and
his brother Philip tetrarch of the
region of iteria and trachonitis
and lucinius tetrarch of Abilene during
the high priesthood of anus and Caiaphas
the word of God came to John the son of
Zechariah in the wilderness
and he went into all the region around
the Jordan proclaiming a baptism of
repentance for the Forgiveness of sins
as it is written in the book of Isaiah
the prophet
the voice of one crying in the
wilderness
prepare the way of the Lord make his
paths straight
every Valley shall be filled and every
mountain and Hills shall be made low and
the Crooked shall become straight and
the rough places shall become level ways
and All Flesh shall see the salvation of
our God
if we want to understand what Luke is
telling us about John the Baptist or
John the baptizer
we need to understand the portion of
Isaiah that Luke gives to us as a lens
through which to interpret who this man
is and what his ministry is all about
so what I'd like to do with you here is
just put on the screen
one verse from Isaiah 40 that Luke
quotes and then we'll look at a couple
others now Luke quotes Isaiah 40 verses
3 through 5 but we're just going to look
at Isaiah 40 verse 3 for now because it
will make the point that I want to make
here's what Isaiah says in Isaiah 40
verse 3 that Luke quotes a voice cries
in the wilderness prepare the way of the
Lord make straight in the desert a
highway for our God
in the context of Isaiah
who is the voice announcing
whose arrival is the voice announcing in
the context of Isaiah
it is not Jesus
now Keegan I know teaches the youth
class anytime you're asked a question
always say Jesus that's always the
answer well kids here's one time when
you can say Keegan actually this time
it's not Jesus at least Jesus isn't the
entire answer
the primary answer in the context of
Isaiah is the voice in the wilderness is
announcing the coming of Yahweh himself
in your Old Testament as I'm sure most
of you know whenever you see the word
Lord in all capital letters in your Old
Testament that's a way for the
translators to tell you in the Hebrew
text it's the name Yahweh that is there
I am the name of God
so this voice is announcing in Isaiah
the coming of God himself
now we also though need to look at
another passage in Isaiah 40. that's
part of the context of this verse
those of you that were in my class on
the gospels you may remember me saying
in the New Testament
whenever a new testament author quotes
from an Old Testament Passage
most of the time
that new testament author is wanting to
draw our attention to the entire context
of a passage not just the few lines that
he happens to quote
and so
when he quotes from Isaiah 40 verses 3
through 5 it's very important we
understand what that passage is talking
about in other words what does it mean
that Yahweh himself is coming well we
see that in Isaiah 40 verses 9 to 10. go
up on a high mountain oh Zion Herald of
good news
lift up your voice with strength o
Jerusalem Harold of good news lift it up
fear not say to the cities of Judah
behold your God
behold the Lord Yahweh comes with might
and his arm rules for him
his reward is with him and his
recompense before him
when Yahweh comes in the context of this
passage of Isaiah and in the context of
the entire book of Isaiah
when Yahweh comes after this time of the
Exile because Isaiah is talking here
about after the time of the Exile Yahweh
is going to come to his people and he is
going to bring the full extent of his
rulership to Creation he is going to
manifest his kingship fully in creation
and enforce his values in the world that
he has made
and this means
for one reward for his people
it also means recompense as you can see
on the screen that that is making amends
for wrongs that have been done when
Yahweh comes as king he's going to take
care of all the things that have been
done wrong in his creation he's going to
make them right
and he's going to bring reward for his
people
now the remarkable thing
that we know from the rest of Luke's
narrative
is that if if John is this voice if he
is the voice in the wilderness
announcing
the kingship of Yahweh that is coming
yahweh's rulership coming to Creation
the remarkable thing that Luke's
narrative then tells us is that God does
not come in the full might of his
kingship in a whirlwind let's say or a
storm like we're having outside now or
these Chariots of Fire that come and
just announce his presence rather he
comes in the form of a lowly man from a
no-nothing town
who you wouldn't give a second look to
if you saw
now we don't have time to trace that
thought through
but I wanted to mention it just as kind
of a way of saying hey don't don't don't
miss the shock here of what John the
Baptist is announcing in the wilderness
and then the kingship of Yahweh comes in
this man who's going to end up being
crucified by the Romans as a criminal
that's the kingship of Yahweh that
Isaiah promised yes it is that's what
Luke will go on to talk about
but for our purposes tonight we need to
return to Luke chapter 3.
so here's a summary of our point so far
that we needed to establish here so we
understand the words that this Herald is
going to be saying and if you're using
the outline and the encourager here's
the first blank there for you
in these first six verses
Luke is establishing that John the
baptizer is the herald of Isaiah 40 who
announces the coming of Yahweh to rule
his King
that is what that is who John the
baptizer is according to Luke
now what message then might you expect
John the baptizer to be delivering to
his audience if he's the one announcing
the coming of Yahweh as king and if the
Jews then are going to the Wilderness to
hear this message and to be baptized by
John the baptizer what might you expect
John's message to be
maybe something like come and behold the
goodness of our God
come and experience his reward because
after all that's what Isaiah talked
about
now John might have said things like
that he probably did at certain times
but I suspect
that he was more often than not much
more challenging to his audience and the
reason I say that is because of what
Luke tells us now in verse 7 that John
the Baptist says go back to Luke 3.
and look at what John the Baptist says
and no these are the first words out of
this character's mouth
Luke 3 7 he said therefore to the crowds
that came out to be baptized by him
you brood of vipers
who warned you to flee from the Wrath to
come
bear fruits in keeping with repentance
and do not begin to say to yourselves we
have Abraham as our father
for I tell you God is able from these
stones to raise up children from Abraham
even now the ax is laid to the root of
the trees every tree therefore that does
not bear good fruit will be cut down and
thrown into the fire
do you see the Striking nature of John's
address here
we're experiencing our own immersion
baptism here it sounds like from outside
there
John's audience is a crowd who has come
to be baptized by him and this is his
grieving to them
it's not
good morning my fellow Israelites we
seem to have some visitors here at this
baptismal service welcome we're glad to
have you here his opening line is you
brood of vipers
who warned you to be here and flee from
the Wrath to come
now why might this prophetic figure
who is a mouthpiece of God himself
why might he have spoken to his audience
so provocatively
well I think the answer is implied in
the very or excuse me in verse 8.
when he says in verse 8
bear fruits in keeping with repentance
I usually am known for talking loud but
I'm going to really have to talk loud
tonight over that rain out there
when John says bear fruit in keeping
with repentance
he is saying that because he knows
some are in his audience
who are not there because of a penitent
heart
and John is trying desperately
to slap them out of their stupor so to
speak
and get them to recognize the urgency of
what is coming
and another message
that John gives to his audience that
also implies for us why he is speaking
to them so provocatively
is what he says in the in the second
half of verse 8.
when he says to them do not begin to say
to yourselves that we have Abraham as
our father
for I tell you God can raise up children
of Abraham from these stones
some in his audience
we're making the mistake
that their Heritage as an Israelite
I'm part of the right group
therefore I'm safe
I don't have anything to worry about for
the Judgment of God
I'm part of the right heritage
I'm part of the right genetic line
so if I'm a child of Abraham if I'm
descended for Abraham I'm good it's the
Nations that need to worry the Gentiles
it's not me
and John says to his audience absolutely
not
you bear fruits in keeping with
repentance
that is what will dictate whether you
will receive blessing or judgment from
the King that is coming
and again the reason why John is
speaking so provocatively here
it's because of what John describes in
verse 9. if you look at verse 9 of Luke
3.
we could summarize it like this
and here's the next point if you're
using your outline
the coming Kings imminent judgment
will sort People based on fruits of
repentance not genetics or heritage
the coming Kings imminent judgment
will sort People based on fruits of
repentance not genetics or heritage
when the Lord comes
to enforce his kingship in creation
the people that he's going to be looking
for are not the people of a certain
group or a certain tribe he's going to
be looking for the people who have lived
his values in the world that he has made
and the urgency of this is seen in the
imagery of verse 9. where John uses
imagery from nature those trees that
bear fruit
they will remain standing
but those that do not will be chopped
down and thrown into the fire
and look at the imagery John uses where
he talks about the acts being laid at
the at the foot of the tree at the root
of the tree
and it's either the idea that the ax is
lying right where God is going to start
chopping or it could be that what he's
depicting is God is already holding the
ax and he's standing there with the ax
at the root of the tree and all he's got
to do is now just start swinging
that's the urgency that John is trying
to get across to his audience
and in light of this message
notice how the people respond
they respond with a question that all of
us should be asking let's read verse 10
of Luke 3.
and the crowds asked him
What then shall we do
I've titled my sermon that tonight
because that is the question that all of
us should be asking ourselves
in light of the fact
that this world was created
by a holy God
and in light of the fact
that he is going to bring his kingship
into creation and eradicate every
rebellious force that existed
in light of that fact each of us should
then be asking What then shall we do
how should I respond to this reality
that I will come face to face
with the God who spoke everything into
existence
notice how John responds
read with me the remaining portion of
this text Luke 3 look at verses 10 to 14
with me
and the crowd's asking
What then shall we do
and he answered them
Whoever has two tunics
is to share with him who has none
and whoever has food is to do likewise
Tax Collectors also came to be baptized
and said to him teacher what shall we do
and he said to them
collect no more than you are authorized
to do
soldiers also asked him and we what
shall we do
and he said to them
do not extort money from anyone by
threats or by false accusation and be
content with your wages
do you want to be ready for the coming
King
well here's the first thing John tells
us and that Luke tells us by recording
this for us if you want to be ready for
the king then share your Surplus with
the needy
share your Surplus with the needy
those who have two tunics are to share
with those who have none
let me explain very quickly what he
means by the word tunic
the word that he's using there refers to
that inner garment you can see some of
the characters here wearing so not the
Overcoat it's not the Overcoat you see
some of these characters wearing it's
the Garment that's worn next to the skin
without which a person would be naked
so what John is saying is
those of you who have more than what you
need
give to those who need it
those who would be naked because they
don't have a tunic of Their Own
and the parallel statement that he makes
in verse 11 makes the same point
Whoever has food is to do likewise
with all of that in our minds
can you see
Can You Feel the force of what John is
saying
he's saying that what you do with your
possessions
says something about whether you are
ready to meet the king or not
and so if you want to be ready to meet
the king
share what you have with those who don't
have
and John then gives another fruit of
repentance
you could say that he gives two more but
since they're similar I'm going to treat
them together here
if you want to be ready to face the king
then stop taking advantage of others to
gain more for yourself
stop taking advantage of others to gain
more for yourself
this is the summary of what he says to
the tax collectors
collect no more than you need to in
other words stop cheating people out of
their money so you can have more stop
being dishonest in how you do your job
so you can get more money
and he says to the soldiers
do not extort money from people by false
accusation and threats stop using your
position of power to oppress others so
you can get more for yourself
and you be content with your wages
now I do want to say one thing lest
anybody misunderstand John's Point here
when John says
be content with your wages in other
words be content with what you have
he is not talking to the poor here
he's not saying to the poor stop wishing
you had more and just be grateful for
what you do have that is not what he's
saying
he is talking to
Tax Collectors who are wealthy and
soldiers who have a steady income
so I don't want anyone to misunderstand
tonight what I mean when I say that
John's message as I'm summarizing it is
be content with what you have and stop
trying to just get more for yourself by
taking advantage of other people I don't
want anyone to misunderstand and think
oh well I'm struggling really
financially and so I'm getting condemned
for that no it's very important we know
who John is talking to when he says this
here
so to summarize this portion of text
before we close with some applications
John and Luke by extension who's
recording this Force
John the baptizer and Luke are trying to
get their audience to understand
that the king is coming
and those who will receive his Blessing
are those who are demonstrating fruits
of repentance in their lifestyle
and John gives three examples of what
that looks like in this portion of text
now you've listened so well although I'm
assuming you can hear me over this ring
I don't know if he can or not
but may I just take 10 more minutes 10
to 15 minutes here
to make some applications
if we understand what this portion of
text means in its context we can't stop
there we need to also talk about how
does that meaning extend into our modern
circumstances how can I demonstrate that
I know what this text means in my
lifestyle and that's what I want to talk
to you about now
now I've put these applications
in the form of questions
to prompt you to wrestle with some of
the challenges that I think John is
posing to us in this text and that Luke
is also posing To Us by recording this
so here is my first application question
to help us wrestle with this passage
is your presence
among This Crowd
a fruit of repentance
is your presence here among This Crowd a
fruit of repentance
in other words
why are you here
are you here because
you have a penitent heart
that wants to come and beg for mercy at
the Throne of God himself
is that why you're here
or
are you here because well this is what
other people expect me to do so I'm just
going to come here to keep up
appearances
or are you here because well this just
helps me to feel better about myself
that's why I'm here among this trout
here
in other words
would John the Baptist
look at us
and say to us you brood of vipers
who warned you to flee from the Wrath to
come
bear fruits in keeping with repentance
John would remind us
that our presence here among This Crowd
doesn't necessarily say a single thing
about whether we're going to receive the
blessing of the king or his judgment
your presence among the crowd
doesn't say anything about them
how are you living
what fruits of repentance are you being
that's the question
for my next application I need to
preface it so before I put her on the
screen let me preface this
John's statement about his audience's
Jewish Heritage when he says do not
presume to say to yourselves we have
Abraham as our father
that may seem a little difficult to
apply to our modern circumstances
but I would argue
that we can absolutely apply them
to ourselves
because the Trap of thinking
that our security
rests in a certain group that we're a
part of is a human trap that anybody can
fall into
and for us
I wonder I would submit this to you to
consider
I wonder if this trap is especially
before us
because of how our history in Churches
of Christ has trained us to think and to
speak of ourselves
let me put my question up here and I'll
expound on what I mean by that but
here's my question
do we esteem ourselves secure simply
because we attend a church of Christ
do we esteem ourselves secure simply
because I attended church of Christ
I'm part of the right group
we have a heritage
just like Israel did
we have a heritage
that began
with certain individuals wanting to
restore first century Christianity
and that has led some after all these
years
some have claimed either explicitly or
implicitly that we have in fact achieved
the restoration of first century
Christianity
to the point that
we can speak of ourselves as New
Testament Christians to the exclusion of
any other claimant to the Christian
faith
or
to speak of ourselves as the true church
meaning
everyone else is false
and so I would submit to you
that since that is an integral part of
our history in this heritage
it puts before us this trap of thinking
that I'm part of the right group
this is the right church and so long as
I'm a member
at a church of Christ I'm good
we are the people who will receive God's
blessing
we don't have anything to worry about
and so I would ask you has your trust in
this Heritage supplanted your focus on
your lifestyle
wouldn't John
say to us
do not presume to say to yourselves
we're members of a Church of Christ
if all God wanted were people to attend
Churches of Christ he could raise up
people to fill pews from the stones of
the Earth
how are you living
what are you doing in your lifestyle
that shows I recognize the king is
coming and so I'm living those fruits of
repentance because that is how John says
first and foremost the people of the
king will be identified
John's audience believed that the king's
coming would automatically mean blessing
for them
because they're part of the right group
and I would submit to you that an
application for us to be wary of a
similar trap we can fall into
is thinking that well if we're part of
this particular Church we're good I
don't really need to give a whole lot of
other thought
to my lifestyle because I'm part of the
right heritage
and I think John would
really questions on that
and so now let me turn my attention to
the specific fruits of repentance
that John talks about here the ones that
at least according to what Lucas said
in this particular passage these are the
things that will identify the people who
will be blessed by the king
so here's my next application question
does your attitude towards your
possessions
demonstrate that you are ready
to face the king
does your attitude towards your
possessions
demonstrate that you're ready to face
the king
in this life there are those who have
more than they need
and there are those who are in need
and When the Crowds asked John What then
shall we do his answer was those of you
that have more than you need share with
the needy
that's what you can do to prepare for
the king's coming
and he says Whoever has two tunics
let him share with those who have none
if that's true for the person that has
two tunics
how much more would God expect of those
who have a closet full of tunics so to
speak
and he says Whoever has food is to do
likewise to share with those who have no
food
well if that's true for the person who
has enough food for the day or for the
next few days in that agrarian society
how much more would God expect from
those of us who have enough food for
weeks and months in our homes
now let me be honest with you about
something
this makes me uncomfortable
it makes me uncomfortable
because the older I've gotten and the
more that I've come to wrestle with
these texts and not just read over them
the more that I've that I realize how
much I have and the more I wrestle with
these ticks the more I realize I'm not
really sure that I've used my wealth the
way God
would have me to use
and it's something that now weighs
heavily on me
because we live
in an ultra wealthy Society we are an
anomaly in world history
where you have this amount of wealth
extended over such a large portion of
the country's population this is an
anomaly in world history
and so I would argue that when the New
Testament talks about the dangers of
wealth we especially should perk our
ears up and pay deep attention to those
passages
but I'm teaching this to you and I'm
bringing this up
because I think that John's message is
meant to make us uncomfortable
so that we can repent
and we can make changes and we can bear
more fruit for the king and show by how
we use our wealth and our Surplus that
we are indeed ready for the king's
return
so according to my understanding of this
this text this is what John forces us to
wrestle with this question
does your attitude towards your
possessions demonstrate that you're
ready to face the king
do we use our possessions to help the
needy
are we generous with what we have or
do we withhold what we have
Because deep down we are materialists
only you can answer that question for
yourself
only I can answer it for myself
but each of us will stand before the
king and we will answer that to him
when he returns
and then one more I give you one more
application on the things that John has
told us here
we'll apply what John says in verses 12
to 14 when he's talking to the tax
collectors and the soldiers
and here's the application question I
would submit to you
do you justify immoral means to gain
more wealth
do you justify
immoral means
to gain more for yourself
one way that we can know
that our God is wealth
is when we justify the immoral practices
to acquire more of it
that's when we know our God is really
wealth it's not Yahweh it's not King
Jesus
this person owes me this much
so I'm gonna lie and I'm going to say
they owe me more
or I'll make up some reason why they
need to pay me more so that I can pocket
the Surplus I just want more for myself
I'm gonna try to wring out every penny I
can from this person's business
so I can get a little more for myself
may I share with you one personal
example of how I think I have violated
this passage when I was younger
any of you wait tables
now I've waited tables in my past
at the end of the night when you had to
put in your tips
you know what I used to do
I lie and I'd say I made lesson tips so
that I wouldn't get text as much
on my taxes
and I Justified that because everybody
was doing it every server did that it
was just part of the culture and in
serving you never put in your actual
amount of tips
brothers and sisters I would submit to
you I was dead wrong in that I was
sitting I was lying so I could just get
a little more
and if you wait tables I'd submit that
to you to think about
am I falling into the Trap that John the
Baptist is talking about here
am I justifying immoral means of getting
a little bit more for myself
these questions are hard questions
they're hard questions
like I said they make me uncomfortable
perhaps they've made you uncomfortable
as you've wrestled with them
but I honestly think
that if John the baptizer was here
and we said to him John you're making me
a little uncomfortable his response
would be good
good
because you need to understand what is
coming
and that and what is coming
is described in the last few verses of
our passage and will close with these
verses would you look at Luke 3 verses
15 to 18 with me
this is why John would say to us I'm
glad I made you uncomfortable
as the people were in expectation and
all were questioning in their hearts
concerning John whether he might be the
Christ
John answered them all saying I baptize
you with water
but he who is mightier than I is coming
the strap of whose sandals I am not
worthy to untie
he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit
and Fire
his winnowing Fork is in his hand to
clear his threshing floor and to gather
the wheat into his barn but the chaff
he will burn with unquenchable fire
the point that we get from these verses
that we'll close with is this
whether the king's coming is good news
depends
on whether you are a fruit-bearing tree
whether the king's coming is indeed
gospel good news
depends on what type of tree you are
are you a fruitful tree
that bears fruits of repentance
or are you a fruitless tree
that Jesus Will chop down and throw into
the fire
What then shall we do in light of that
in light of that reality
well here's a summary of what we've said
tonight
when Jesus of Nazareth returns to
enforce his kingship in creation
those who are ready for the king and who
will receive his Blessing
are those who do not put their trust in
their Heritage but rather produce fruits
of repentance in their lifestyle
and they are those who share what they
have with the needy
and they are those
who don't justify immoral actions to
gain more wealth for themselves
those are fruits that Mark the ones that
are truly ready
to meet King Jesus when he returns
to enforce his kingship
and my prayer
is that this sermon from John the
Baptist will help all of us to Bear more
fruit and to be more ready for the
king's return because if that's the case
then John the Baptist's Ministry is
still doing
what he was given by God to do two
thousand years ago he is still preparing
a people for the coming of King Yahweh
but that's only if we listen to his
message
and we then bear those fruits of
repentance
and I pray
that we do
and if John's message has pricked your
heart tonight
if there's some confession that you feel
