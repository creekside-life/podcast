good
evening it's good to be here with you
tonight uh I am humbled to have been
asked to present a message with you guys
tonight for those of you who don't know
me my name is Brian Smith I've been
attending bols Creekside since 2016 is
uh we didn't Place membership actually
but we were regularly coming um and just
been here ever since and
it's simply an honor to be able to be up
here and just talk about God's word with
you I turned 30 in
May I don't know about you guys I don't
know if 30 for some of you was some
special number or if 30 is some special
number you might look forward to for
some of you I don't really know what it
meant to you that
number to
me I also don't know what it means to me
this in May when it hit me it just felt
like another another day I didn't dread
30 I didn't you know think about oh it's
all downhill from there it just felt
like another
number however 30 has coincided with
something pretty big for me and and my
wife we had a kid uh she's two months
old now a a rain Smith
and that that meant a lot to me that
meant more than the number 30 but they
happened to
coincide and so I found myself in the
past few months really reflecting on my
life and thinking a lot
about how is it that I got to this point
where I'm standing before
you at this moment to talk to you about
God's
word all the things that led to this
point and when I was really dwelling on
it thinking about it some of it was kind
of over
overwhelming I've had some really high
highs in my life I've had some really
low lows in my
life and when I was thinking of them
some of them popped in my
head I remember one of the highs was
when I was in elementary school my mom
signed me up for t a Taekwondo class and
was a month free month free membership
right I was so pumped I've been you know
a ninja for Halloween for like six
Halloweens in a row and this was the
moment I had legitimacy
right and in that
month I got a yellow tip
belt that's a big accomplishment guys I
don't in a month yellow
tip now it was really expensive to
continue that membership so we didn't
right I had a month but to this day I'm
still a little bit not a little bit I'm
a lot of bit proud of that yellow tip
belt that I got in
Taekwondo it's one of my
highs I also have this memory of
lows in middle school I remember getting
kicked out of Middle School due to
missing a lot of school attendance
issues and a lot of that was due to
Medical I had severe migraines and I was
missing a lot of
school I wasn't able to be there and I
started to really I was spending a lot
of time in my bed and not in the school
and getting kicked out and it was a real
low for
me I remember in middle
school and Elementary or and and high
school attending my Bible Church camp my
local Bible Church camp man those were
good times and specifically I remember
being the most proud of at the end of
the week I got you know we had trophies
that we give out for different things
and I got best Bible boy and I was so
excited because I had been just like
really really studying my Bible during
that time and I really just wanted some
recognition at the time honestly I
wanted people to know that I've been
working really hard and that's what I
wanted to get that was my goal for the
week as be best Bible boy I knew my
stuff and I got rewarded that that's a
trophy that I felt really proud about
getting that was one of the
highs I also had
lows High School I remember being so
down in a dark place because I was
battling addiction that was personal to
me that no one else knew about that I
was struggling
with and it really affected a lot of
things people that I cared about things
that I loved were affected by what I was
going
through was a real
low and I think about all these things
and through the highs through the lows
somehow I still managed to get to this
point where I'm truly
blessed where I'm able to meet at a
congregation with fellow Christians
where I'm able
to have a wife who is just the most
amazing mother to our
newborn I have a daughter there's so
many many things that I'm just so
blessed with and when I think back to
those moments I also think it back to my
mindset there was times where I really
wish that Jesus would just come
back I wish he would just come and
everything would be done I wouldn't have
to deal with the stuff that's going
on I didn't enjoy life life was tough
and I knew if I'm okay if he came back
in fact I'm hoping tomorrow will be the
day he comes back
I also remember times where I really
wish Jesus wouldn't come back
yet I wasn't in a place where I felt
good about my spiritual
life and I just wanted to have time to
get things back on
track and I remember asking God just I
just need some time I can figure this
out I can get this together I just need
time and hoping that it wasn't it wasn't
time for him to come
back I've been in both of those headp
spaces I'm wondering if maybe some of
you can relate some of you been in those
places I imagine imagine a lot of you
can the truth is we've all gone through
transitions in life none of us have
gotten to this point easy where you're
at and if you know there's some more
transitions
ahead there's a lot more
Transitions and this evening I just want
to spend some time with you
guys talking about what I view as a
crucial reminder for those who are
seeking to walk this path of
righteousness that we
are there's no autopilot in our life
there's no cruise control there's no one
setting that can get us all the way to
the Finish Line if there was I think
we'd all click that on and we'd sit back
and we'd enjoy this ride
right but that's not how life Works life
takes adaptation it takes learning
growth pain
suffering so many things are
needed and the truth is that we are in
need of constant Corrections in life
fine-tunings
adjustments we need work to function and
grow in the way that we are intended to
grow as human beings and as children of
God I'm talking tonight about spiritual
recalibration I came to that because I
really like the word recalibration and I
thought it
fit to recalibrate something means to
calibrate
again cool definition
right it's a simple definition of
calibrating or a simple definition of
calibrating might be to make adjustments
or to check the settings or the controls
used to make measurements with a tool or
measuring
device a simple example of this would be
a scale right a scale that you might
step on I remember back in midd uh
Middle School elementary back around
that time my dad had a riding lawn mower
and I wanted to ride on that thing so
bad badly by myself I didn't want to sit
in my dad's lap I wanted to cut that
grass in that riding lawn mower all by
myself here's the problem that riding
lawn mower had a weight component to it
it would not start unless you weighed
enough to weigh down that seat to get it
going I did not want to wait so every
week I'd be measuring myself to see if I
was that much closer to being able to
cut the grass and I would go and I would
report back to my dad
and he tell me no You' still got you
know this amount of weight you still got
to get to this point and I was so
frustrated but one day I noticed there's
a little turning knob at the bottom of
the scale and when I just moved it a
little bit it would change the weight on
the scale and so I would nudged that
thing over and I went about five or 10
pounds more right and I weighed myself
and I'm like this is the number and I
called my dad over and I said Dad I'm
ready and he looked at it and he was
shocked he was like wow you've been
eaten that's crazy that's so I mean just
a little bit ago you were this this
can't be right I said no this is what it
says so he took me down to the field
started up for me and I sat on it and
the thing just turned off right it
didn't work and that's when he he said
did you mess with them yes I messed with
the scale I didn't click that it didn't
wouldn't work I just thought you
anyways so I had to hold a brick in my
lap to
complete complete the cutting of the
grass but that's what a a calibration is
setting the scale so it measures
accurately right adjusting so that you
are functioning in the way that you
should recalibrating our spiritual life
is setting our spiritual life in the way
that it should be
set and how do we do that you have to
have something to measure it against
that's what I want to talk to you about
tonight you see I strongly believe that
our society is set up in a way that it
is constantly pressuring us to adhere to
Christian values in a way that is
inauthentic and creates
complacency in us as children of God and
it's it's really goes against God's word
and what it calls us to
do you see when we as Disciples of God
and of Christ are functioning properly
the effect leads to us standing
out rather than blending
in right that's the effect but Society
is constantly pressuring us and we have
this this just pressure that we want to
just kind of lay low we don't want to
stand out too much we don't want to
ruffle feathers caus
issues and it's subtle it's little
things but what that does over time is
it knocks us off off course just a
little
bit just
enough and that's the thing the devil is
happy for us to be knocked off course
just so slightly that it it almost seems
like it's harmless that we could get
away with it just this time these are
harmless concessions
that the truth is they lead to huge
barriers in our walk and our growth with
God if there's no intentional
recalibration of Our Lives then you can
guarantee that you will be put off
course and you will find yourself in a
place of
stagnation in a place of
redundancy in a place of walking through
life without
meaning without feeling
fulfilled the truth is when I think
about this I also think how scary it can
be to come to the realization that you
aren't living the way that you should
that I'm not living the way I
should this is a scary realization for
both Christians Believers and
non-believers coming to terms with the
fact that the way they're living is not
in concordance with the Creator and what
he calls us to
do and it's really difficult for those
who would consider themselves longtime
Christians those
who maybe you've been coasting
along you've been a good person you've
been doing a lot of the really important
things checking the
boxes showing up helping out
but you're
coasting I don't have to say that you
know that we know when we're coasting
and when we're not reaching our
potential some of you may have the
thought of where do I even
start I'm so off course I've been in
this place for so long I wouldn't even
know where to
begin might feel you might feel these
feelings of almost being
paralyzed with this idea of change
because a lot of this is calling us to
change to add things to take things
away and none of us are completely
comfortable with change none of us are
and some change is scarier than
others I think a lot of you can agree
with some of the stuff I'm
saying and you understand it is really
hard it's hard for others and it's hard
for you it's hard for me I get
it it is a paralyzing feeling to be
scared to live as Christ calls us to and
it's just as scary to be scared to die
to be in that middle place of being
scared to live but being scared to
die I think that's a place that If we're
honest a lot more of
us find ourselves in than we'd like to
real than we'd like to admit
and I think it's a real problem in our
church here and outside of other
congregations I don't want to make
things over complicated
tonight I want to keep things simple I
want to focus on what I think is just
one critical component for
re-calibrating our spiritual life
because there's a lot of things that we
know we can be doing and can be working
on but it can be
overwhelming and so I want to just draw
your attention to focusing on one aspect
tonight and that's the aspect of
love you can't take the word love out of
the Bible without it being different
it's it is so ingrained in God's word we
know that you've probably you probably
all heard how many times love is
mentioned in the bible it's a
lot and we
know we know that it's important we know
that we have an understanding of the
importance of
love
but understanding is different than
living it than practicing it in the way
that we
should 1 John 4: 7 and 8 it says beloved
let us love one another for love is from
God and whoever loves has been born of
God and knows God anyone who does not
love God or does not any anyone who does
not love does not know God because God
is
love we know there's so many verses that
sum things up in this way that you can't
take love out of the
equation it's who God is God is
love and to be honest this topic in
particular has been on my mind for some
time having grown up in the
church and also having been here at this
church for some time now I've seen
churches grow I've seen them change Bel
shols Creek Side is no
different I also know of all the plans
that we have in particular here at this
congregation I know the goals that we've
set
forward
and hearing some of them I get so
excited I really do it is just a
fantastic thing that we are striving
for
but stay with me
now we have we have a lot of work to do
to reach those
goals and I'm saying this to myself
knowing that a lot of this applies to me
and I'm saying this because I know a lot
of it applies to you sitting here
tonight and to you sitting at home
watching this on
online I've been at Church my whole life
you've heard me say this before and I
have been in the youth group a lot and
one thing about being in the youth group
you go through some youth ministers
sometimes and you go through a lot of
ideas a lot of programs a lot of things
that they are coming up with that's
going to totally take things over the
top that's going to rejuvenate
reenergize involve connect all good
things all important things
but the truth
is those programs come and go those
clever names that come up with those
programs they don't always live up to
those
expectations they have great intentions
they really
do they have great classes mission
statements all of those
things but those programs are not
winning souls for God's
kingdom those programs are not doing the
work
it should be us it should be
you you are the most critical component
to everything that we have planned here
at this church this
congregation I am a crucial part of
what's going on you are as well and
that's not some you know boast but is it
is some
facts that you listening right now
are the ones that it's going to take to
fill up the work that is
needed and are going to be active in
your faith and accomplish things that go
beyond the lofty goals that we have
here you see God's church needs to be
far more involved in the congregation
and outside the
congregation the truth is when we have
even a measure of the love God calls us
to it calls us to be
radical that's just the way it goes
there is a radical effect when you buy
in and develop the love that God
has Acts chapter 2 verses 42 to 47 I'd
like to read that
passage and they devoted themselves to
the apostles teachings and the
fellowship to the breaking of bread and
the prayers and all who believed were
together and had all things in common
and they were selling their possessions
and belongings and distributing the
proceeds to all as any had need and day
by day attending the temple together and
breaking bread in their homes they
received their food with glad and
generous Hearts praising God and having
favor with all the people and the Lord
added to their number day by day those
who were being
saved I think about this passage a lot
because it's one of those moments that I
would just love to be there and see that
in action
have you ever had one of those moments
in life where you wish you could just
take a snapshot and feel that way feel
that love feel that energy for the rest
of your life or that you could call back
that memory so fully and and how you
felt in that
moment this is one of those times I wish
I could go back and know what it felt
like to be a part of such a
movement such a
unified and purposeful
movement and there's so clearly love
there involved you can't be doing the
things they were doing and growing the
way they were growing without love
without commitment acting on
that my point brothers and sisters is I
know that we are capable of so much more
when we place our faith wholly in God
and develop this love that we are called
to
have and and as I've said this is an
individual
undertaking it takes more than knowledge
but intentional
practice having a great understanding
and knowledge of these of these things
that we talk about that we preach it's
great and it can make some things
easier
but
sometimes there's times where I almost
feel like it gets in the way that we are
so involved in understanding and so D in
just learning that we forget the most
important component of playing it out
practicing it messing up learning from
it
growing I think of Matthew chapter 22:
34-40 as Keegan read for
us these Pharisees and Sadducees they
were some really smart people I'll give
them credit even the questions they were
asking Jesus to test him to cause him to
trip up those were clever they were
really smart
questions I feel like I would not have
been able to maneuver the way Jesus
did it would have tripped me up would
had me stumbling would I would have said
I'm not sure give me time to think about
it right these are smart people people
who knew God's word studied it they were
known as the religious leaders of the
day and
yet they're missing something aren't
they we know that we've talked about
them
before but the truth is they did know
their
stuff but they were missing the heart of
God's
word they developed these hypocritical
Lifestyles and elevated themselves above
others
constantly Jesus calls them out for them
constantly I submit to you though that
when we leave out love in the way that
we're called by God I don't think it's a
big stretch to see that we're not that
much different than these spiritual
leaders of that
time I don't think it's that bigest
stretch at
all and I say that because I hear so
many stories from individuals who have
fallen from the church or who have
visited and and left because I mean the
number one thing I hear is the hypocrisy
in the
church and sure some of that can be you
know deflecting or or having an excuse
but I'm sure a lot of it there's some
real validity
there Jesus's response In this passage
he leads with two Commandments about
love and he says that everything else
depends on
these and I I think that's one of the
biggest reasons why I'm saying love is
what I I want to talk to you about
tonight for recalibrating our spiritual
lives because Jesus here saying it
starts right here these two Commandments
about love set everything else in
order it sets the tone and it allows us
to continue in a way that we were
intended to
right God created us he knows what we
are intended to do how we intended to
function and we should probably listen
to him about how to recalibrate
ourselves so that we can function in the
way we're meant to rather than listen to
a society and the devil are trying to
influence us and trying to tell us this
is a better way to function this is
easier way to
function again I wanted to keep it
simple tonight and I've just got a few
practical things that I I want to call
you to consider trying out not an
exhaustive list not an exhaustive list
at
all but just something to keep you maybe
where to take the first step if you're
really struggling maybe this might be
some areas that you could
consider just a few practical tips to
start recalibrating your spiritual life
with
love the first one is I want you to
consider taking out the conditions that
you have placed on your
love
whether you're aware of them or not we
have all placed limits on what does or
doesn't deserve our
love it's natural we've had experiences
that have caused us to see things
through a
filter we don't want to be hurt by past
people we don't want to go through those
things again and that filter is applied
even without us
knowing that's how we work that's how
our brains
function and we do it without thinking
to the point that it feels natural it
feels like there's no other way it could
be but God does not Place conditions on
his love Romans 5'8 we know it while we
were still sinners Christ died for us we
know the unconditional component of
God's
love and Rex pointed out just a few
months ago in his lesson on love and the
fruits of the spirit that we can't fully
have the love that God does that's just
not it's not possible it's not realistic
we just
can't but if you want to have a greater
relationship with God a greater
understanding of him then shooting for
the way he
loves trying your best to get as close
to it as you
can is going to allow you to have some
greater understanding of the love God
shows
us that's how you have feel that's how
you form relationships with people right
you learn through experiences you learn
about them and it's the same with God
striving to love the way he does will
help you understand him better
appreciate him more and form that
relationship
more I know when I when I talk about
conditions of love some of you may be
thinking about that person or those
people in your life that are really hard
to get along
with maybe they've set themselves
against you in some some way or
form how are we to respond in those
situations how are we
called because we all have again those
filters those biases those conditions
that maybe hold us back from really
giving the love that we know we
could I I just present to you the story
of David in relation to
Saul and Saul's set himself up against
David has he not I mean he has been
consumed with this idea of David and he
has sought him
out and in 1 Samuel chapter 24 I just
like to read um a bit of this this
passage where Saul has been seeking out
David and David's hiding in this cave
with his
men and it reads and he came to the
sheepfolds by the way where there was a
cave and Saul went in to relieve himself
now David and his men were sitting in
the innermost parts of the cave and the
men of David said to him here is the day
of which the Lord said to you behold I
will give your enemy into your hand and
you shall do to him as it shall seem
good to you then David arose and
stealthily cut off a corner of Saul's
robe and after afterward David's heart
struck him because he had cut off a
corner of Saul's robe he said to his men
the Lord forbid that I should do this
thing to my Lord the Lord's anointed to
put out of my hand against him seeing he
is the Lord's
anointed so David persuaded his men with
these words and did not permit them to
attack Saul and Saul rose up and left
the cave and went on his
way
I think this is a really cool story
because this is a situation
where David's men are like this is it
this is our chance we can rid ourselves
of the enemy of the one who's coming
against us this is the perfect time
David God is doing this for you let's
let's take advantage of this right
now David doesn't buy into that he
doesn't buy into what they're
selling even though Saul has done these
things has attempted these things David
still finds it in him to show
compassion
why
how he thought of God he thought of what
God wanted in that moment of what God
would call him to
do and he knew that the Lord forbid that
I should do this
thing he respected Saul's title of of of
you know what he was holding and he knew
that God had a plan his timing was
better and God was going to take care of
things and David didn't need to take
things into his hand at that
time it's really
hard to deal with those who have set
them set themselves against us it's
really
hard but
man whenever you were able to overcome
that feeling to just get back at them
when you're a whenever you're able to
overcome and in fact not just hold back
but in fact show them
love that is a far greater feeling than
holding on to that anger and that
bitterness that we we want to hold on to
in the
moment far
better but the first step in taking out
these conditions that we have is
identifying that we do have those
conditions that's the first step
we know we do we place these conditions
on love and Society will tell you to
place place these conditions on the love
because it's good it's it's the right
way to do it it's
important and what we're doing when we
when we follow that advice is we're
limiting our reach as Christians as
Disciples of
Christ how are they supposed to know
that we are
Christians by our love is that not right
is that not God's
word well if we keep making these
smaller and smaller criteria for who
deserves our love the less we will be
called to get up and make a difference
in Sharing
Jesus and the more you're going to sit
back and the more you're going to blend
in and the more you're going to watch
life pass you
by I uh this past week
I was
helping
well background of course you know I I
am a therapist but I I work with a team
of case managers and and psychologists
and the case managers came up to me and
they let me know there was a lady who
was leaving our program and she had no
support no help
whatsoever she had very little
income basically none and she asked if
we we could help her one more time
before she leaves the truth is our
program had already discharged her she
was done she moved on we had no reason
to help this woman but she was moving
and she needed just some help moving
some
stuff and some of the other case
managers said that you know they weren't
going to do it because they didn't want
to you know be liable for doing
something that wasn't you know on the
clock or it wasn't part of the job they
didn't want to risk
it well I said I would help I didn't
mind it was fine she needed help well
when I said that some of my other case
managers they said okay fine we'll help
you out too you can't do it by yourself
we'll go to awesome I didn't really want
to do it by myself so it was great that
they helped out so myself and three
other guys we get up on the day to go
help this this lady move and again this
is someone who's low income she doesn't
have any support and she's moving to a
smaller um smaller
apartment we get there the case managers
walk in the door first and they stop and
they turn to me and they go we're never
going to forgive
you because in that house stacked almost
to the ceiling was so many
things turns out this this older woman
was a bit of a hoarder and although she
did not have much money she was able to
collect a lot of things
we started at 9:00 and throughout that
time my case managers kept coming up to
me and you know hit me in the rib
telling me you know I bet you regret
doing this don't you now we I mean they
were really giving it to me and every
time I told them I don't regret this at
all I would say yes again she needed
help she deserved help but yeah I wish
we had some movers right I would have
paid to have some movers come help us
out and the truth is they also knew that
what I was saying was right that what I
was doing was
right and I'm not trust me I'm not
saying this to brag about
myself but after that once we completed
that task and my buddies were were
exhausted because I mean some of that F
Furniture is heavy no dolly right and I
left all in my back the truth
is they came to me afterwards and they
told
me it felt good to help them and I
probably wouldn't have done it myself I
probably wouldn't have stepped up if I
knew how much it was I definitely would
have called out that
day but we knew that you meant what you
said and so we were going to stick it
out and we're going to help you
out I say that
because that lady it meant a lot to her
probably more than I
know and I think it meant a lot to my
case managers who were who were part of
the team too to see that even though
that job was far more than what we
signed up
for I was happy we did it I would have
done it again it had nothing to do with
a task at hand had everything to do with
loving someone helping someone out
that's the bigger
message
right that's what we're supposed to be
doing in our life it does not matter
what the task is it does not matter if
others would say this is not our job but
calling ourselves up getting off our
butt excuse me for saying butt in the
pulpit
and and just
acting not waiting for someone else to
be the one one but being a part of the
solution that's what I'm asking for this
congregation to do more of not because I
don't think some of you can but I think
some of you can do more I can do
more so step one is to identify those
conditions You' placed on your love
examine those identify them reflect on
if this is
okay number
two schedule out time for
love time it's a funny thing it can feel
both fast and slow at the same time
that's what I felt this past two months
with Ada two months old now it has moved
so fast and so slow at the same
time some in this room may consider
themselves really great time
managers Others May just let the days
happen the weeks happen and just
wherever you end up you end up
I want to encourage you one simple thing
is to start each day start in the
morning with something involving
love whether that's reading
scripture writing a letter or a note to
someone that you appreciate that you
love you want to check up
on sending that text or even that
call spending time in prayer to a
god with the focus being on
love spending time with your loved ones
even your pets if they're loved
ones doing something that you know is
Meaningful for you or for someone
else and doing it with an intentional
aspect focused on the idea of
love I think many of you know what you
could do what would categorize for that
for you as love but I ask that you be
intentional with it and do that every
morning starting your day with that each
morning and when you do
that notice how the how the rest of your
day
goes notice how your week
goes because I can almost guarantee
there is a difference in your mentality
how you feel how you think how you
interact with others when you start your
day with being intentionally
loving in fact I would say others might
even notice some of those changes more
than you
will they might ask hey you seem awfully
happy today what what's going on with
you why are you in such a good mood
what's different what have you what do
you got what do you got cooking I want
some of
that scheduling out time for love and
just being intentional with that it's
that simple
the third thing is seeking opportunities
for growth and not running away when
those opportunities actually show
up I said before the kind of love that
we're called to is the kind of love that
ends up with
radical
consequences consequences isn't always a
bad
thing the love of God shows that the
radical Kind of Love is the one that we
we deliver better than anyone
else but radical love is going to take
you places that you can guarantee are
not always
comfortable in
fact that radical love may lead you down
a road that hurt might might end up
being one of the
obstacles you might be let down as
you're going down that path taken
advantage of challenged push to your
limits and at times ask yourself is
there another
way radical love will take you to those
places and if you are not set on
continuing down that road you will turn
back you will avoid that pain that is so
important for
growth it's in those stages that faith
will grow the most and our great works
can be seen the most in the kingdom of
God the story of Jonah comes to mind we
know that story a man who tried to run
away eventually came back and we saw
what he was able to do with God and we
saw really the struggles he had with
love
right but the truth is you are going to
find yourself in those type of places
that are very challenging expect it
prepare for it because it's coming and
that's exactly where you're supposed to
be and if you're not finding yourself in
those challenging places then
recalibrate because you got to you got
to end up there at some point it's just
a matter of
time um fourth thing take care of
yourself I include this one
because we've all heard the saying hurt
people hurt
people and there's so many stories I've
heard of individuals who have gone and
convited and other Christians and other
brothers and sisters and they got just
really awful
responses people who weren't actually
able to help they weren't in a place
that they were ready to
help and they ended up hurting and
wounding others because they had not yet
healed from what they were going
through if you are in a place where you
are still struggling with things that
you've gone through in a place where you
are not ready to help out others when
they're seeking out
help that's okay
but you got to focus on yourself then
you've got to do
something you've got to seek help so
that you can then be ready to help out
others who have been in that place that
you have
been but you can't stay where you're at
and use that as an excuse that might
sound harsh especially if you're in that
place right
now but we have to be a healthy and safe
place for our brothers and sisters to go
to we
can't we can't attack others
unintentionally and over and over and it
contined to be unintentional at some
point there's responsibility and
accountability that you have to take on
yourself and if you truly love others
you got to love yourself enough to work
on what you got to work on and heal
through what you got to heal
through let others help you so that you
can help
others
lastly I want to say that understanding
love is a choice More Than A
Feeling we must understand that love is
a choice More Than A
Feeling sometimes we wait for those
feelings to occur or we just kind of
hope that we'll feel a certain type of
way about somebody and it just doesn't
happen and we feel well I mean I can't
change how I
feel let me tell you we are not a slave
to our
feelings our
feelings are in our
control how we change our feelings is
very very important because we can't
just change our feelings we have to
start at the at the front at the first
thing that comes which is a thought we
have to change our
thoughts because we know that our
thoughts influence our feelings and our
feelings influence how we act
right that's just how it
is Romans 12:2 I appeal to you therefore
Brothers by the mercies of God to
present your bodies as a Living
Sacrifice holy and acceptable to God
which is your spiritual worship do not
be conformed to this world but be
transformed by the renewal of your mind
that by testing you may discern what is
the will of God what is good and
acceptable and
perfect Renewing Your
Mind it's your
thoughts your thoughts will transform
you changing your thoughts will renew it
will change how you feel are you
following
me how we think is so important to how
we feel and how we act so you can't just
wait around to feel that love you can't
wait around to feel a certain way about
someone sometimes you got to straight up
change that thought that you were having
about them you've got to reframe how
you're viewing that
person you got to get out of your own
way if you want to learn to love those
who are difficult to love you're going
to have to change the way you think
about that person bottom
line the thought you choose directly
impacts how you feel and it calls us to
act these
are hopefully just a few simple things
that are practical that you can focus on
because recalibrating our life to get
back on track to a place that we know
we're moving forward is so important
and as I said I feel our society and
culture loves nothing more than a
stagnant
Christian just the components that they
like the the being nice pleasant not
bothering anyone too much they like that
version right they don't want the one
that comes in and is radical in their
love that calls them to a higher higher
being shows them
Jesus because that means they might have
to change it'd be a lot easier if we
just stayed in our lane let every do
what they want to
do we've been tricked to believe that
being nice pleasant or just staying out
of people's way is how we can show them
love and that's just not the
case and I hope tonight that you've
taken that this is not a message for the
church but is a message for you as part
of the
church individually do not allow
yourself to be
complacent we're called so much more to
be so much more and to love with so much
more than we have
been so can we all get on that train can
we focus on the little things to make
steps towards doing some really amazing
things because that's what that's what I
want to be a part of I want to be a
contributing factor and I want to see
you guys there too and tonight maybe
you've been thinking that you haven't
been in the place you you wanted to be
and you're just really needing needing
some help from the church we have Elders
who you can talk to and can come forward
maybe some want to really start on that
path more that path of Love path of
righteousness Walking with God we also
have that opportunity tonight if you
want to answer God's call be baptized
that's okay too we'd love to have you
but we just call you now to just be the
loving Christians God wants you to as
Together We Stand and
sing
