there are many worries there are many
stresses there are many issues facing us
all and facing us all during the
holidays so if you're stressed about
Christmas and what to get for Dad I've
got something you can give him how about
you give Dad a joke just give him a joke
I've got two for you you're G to love it
uh so dad here's how you make Mom laugh
tell her laughter reduces anxiety in
menopausal
women okay
so here's another one Sena may be right
folks you should only visit the family
once a year while they're
asleep as Christmas is upon us there are
many
cups that we may drink from in this life
there are many we may drink from the cup
of living Psalm 23 and verse 5 that cup
often runs
over we may drink from the cup of grief
and grieving Psalm 80
verse5 sometimes we have only tears to
drink we may drink from the cup of
perishing Proverbs 31:6 says there are
those who are ready to perish and they
need comfort from some kind of
medication we may drink from the cup of
giving Matthew 10 and verse 42 talks
about a cup of cold water given in the
name of a disciple we may drink from the
cup of asking Matthew 20 veres 22 and 23
talks about two of the disciples who
came wanting to sit on Jesus left hand
and right hand asking for those seats
and he says are you really able to drink
from the cup that I shall drink from
they thought they could but maybe they
couldn't we may drink from the cup of
sinning Matthew
2325 and 26 talks about that sometimes
the cup is clean on the outside but
inside where we've hidden it all
everybody thinks we're just the perfect
saint but inside there's
uncleanness and nastiness that we have
not purged ourselves
from we may drink from the cup of
forgiving Matthew 26 and verse 27 says
he took the
cup in the middle of his forgiving the
world he took the cup and said take this
and remember what I'm about to do we may
take the cup of blessing 1 Corinthians
10 and verse 16 says the cup that we
participate in the Lord's Supper is
called the cup of blessings and so too
we need to understand that God has
blessed us so with salvation regardless
of what's going on in your life right
now and we may drink from the cup of
raging actually revelation 14 and verse
10 talks about God's going to drink from
the cup of
Rage he has a cup of indignation poured
out into his cup and he will drink from
that cup of letting everybody know
exactly how he feels about the way we've
dealt with him in this world and then
there's drinking from the cup of worry
that's what we're really talking about
here it really looks like Jesus is in
the middle of worry he's not panicked
but he
asked let this cup
pass who would not want that cup to pass
if I were facing the cup he was facing I
would want it to
pass how many times have you wanted your
cup to pass from you this is the cup of
Gethsemane I have a dream of having a
little garden out here that's actually
going to be an Amphitheater Lord willing
and there I want us to put some olive
trees and it' be our little Gethsemane
Garden Amphitheater I think it would be
an awesome thing I think it's important
to remember those places in the Bible
this is the Gethsemane cup of worry
before the terrible events that were
coming that he knew exactly what was
coming unlike you and I he knew what was
coming and didn't kind of know he knew
exactly Jesus faced these worries these
sorrowful of his Gethsemane cup how do
you look at a scourging how do you pass
by a man who's been crucified because
you could see that in his day and not
realize that's me a few days from now I
will do that that's coming upon me how
would that stress you in our text what
he actually says he is stressed almost
to the point of
dying already have you been there have
you been so stressed that you're not
sure that you're even going to live
through the moment because the stress
alone is about to take
you the Gethsemane cup of worry is a cup
we have to learn to give up we have to
learn to give it to the Lord it is true
Philippians 4: 6 six says what was said
a moment ago be anxious for nothing
don't worry about anything for in
everything by prayer and supplication
with Thanksgiving let your requests be
made known to God we aren't to
worry that's the message we aren't to
worry 1 Peter 5 in verse 7 says casting
all your care you can't help but care
I'm not saying you can help from ever
letting worry enter you but what you can
do is not let it dominate you so casting
all your care upon him for he cares for
you so you give it to him so at this
Christmas if you're all stressed out and
some of you probably are more than You'
like to admit especially if your
birthday's on December 25th and you're
wondering am I going to miss out again
so I'm just
saying do more than
survive let's Thrive and do three things
today to help us overcome some of our
worries and I I think if we will do
that you will have a much more pleasant
holiday
season number
one this Christmas give Jesus your
Gethsemane cup of practicing worry I
want to read you something you might not
have noticed from Luke chapter 22 we're
going to bounce around the occasions of
when he's going to Gethsemane right this
was in Luke 22: 39 and 40 it says coming
out he went to the the Mount of Olives
right we all know that that's where
Gethsemane is and as these are the words
I want you to notice as he was
accustomed now there's something have
you paid attention to that I'm coming
back to that in a moment and his
disciples also followed him and when he
came to the place that is Gethsemane he
said to them pray that you may not enter
into
temptation The New American Standard
Version used as was his custom not as he
was accustom but as was his custom it
was his Habit to go to Gethsemane
apparently in the evening I'm guessing
so I
wonder I'm just thinking out loud here I
want you to wonder with me I just wonder
how many trial runs did Jesus give
Gethsemane how many times did he
practice his last last night on
Earth how many times did he kneel in
Gethsemane and think on what was
coming now here's the thought I want you
to think about have you noticed we tend
to practice our worries over and over
have you noticed it's often the same
worry you've had before that you keep
bringing back up have you you notice
that there are certain worries that just
keep coming back have you noticed that
are you practicing
them here's the thing I want you to
think about instead of practicing worry
and being
depressed turn your practice into
praying you see Jesus didn't go to
Gethsemane to sit and
worry he went to Gethsemane to get rid
of the word wor by
praying the stress was there he couldn't
deny it the care was coming you can't
look at it and say I don't care he
cared but he
prayed and he made it his custom to do
it 1 Thessalonians 5:17 and 18 says pray
without ceasing you worry a lot you're
not praying as much as you should then
pray without ceasing in everything give
thanks for this is the will of God in
Christ Jesus so turn your practice of
worry into a practice of
praying that's what he did so this
Christmas give Jesus your Gethsemane cup
a practicing worry but every time it
comes upon you don't hesitate pray Our
Father who are in heaven
Hallowed be thy
name thy kingdom
come thy will be done on Earth as it is
in heaven give us this day our daily
bread and forgive us of our
trespasses as we forgive those who
trespass against us and lead us not into
temptation but Deliver Us from this evil
for thine is the kingdom and the power
and the glory forever forever amen
amen a second lesson I want you to see
is this Christmas not just give up the
cup of practicing worry but give Jesus
your Gethsemane cup of pressing
worry in Mark chap
14:32 it says then they came to a place
which was named now he names it remember
a moment ago the other one didn't name
it but he names it
Gethsemane and he said to his deciples
sit here while I'm
pray
Gethsemane an olive Archard apparently
was on the Mount of
Olives Gethsemane has two words at its
root one is to press so there was an
olive press there and the second word is
oil so it is to press oil that's what
they do with a lot of y'all cook with
olive oil right lot of you have it eat
it drink it I don't know what you do
with it but it's a place of Olives where
they were pressed for their oil you
don't even have to press them very hard
there's a lot of oil in olives quite
honestly but I
wonder I want you to wonder with me I
just wonder how many times Jesus thought
about the
pressure the press that he was under we
all talk about it it's called pressure
I'm under a lot of pressure right now
I'm under a lot of stress we all say it
right you've all you've mentioned that
that the pressure's gotten pretty hard I
wonder if he thought about the pressure
he was going to be under the stress he
was going to be under I wonder if that
was a constant thought every time he
went there where there was a place where
there was
pressing and you press the oil out have
you noticed though have you noticed we
tend to feel the pressure of worry
long before it's
necessary isn't that funny the problem
that you're worried about today may not
be going to K come for 30 days two
months 6 months from now a year from now
some of you worrying about dying right
now and you're
25 it's probably a little further
along
but people worry
long before the problem
comes let me challenge you instead of
the pressing worry which by the way it's
interesting we call it that pressing
worry this pressing worry and being
crushed crushed by the
worry maybe turn your pressing into
Power what
that's exactly what I said Stay With Me
2 Corinthians CH 12 beginning in verse 7
says this Paul said a thorn in fle In
the Flesh a thorn in the flesh we don't
know what it was anybody tells you they
do nobody really knows a thorn in the
flesh was given to me that is Paul a
messenger of Satan what the Apostle Paul
had a messenger Satan to Buffet me
lest I be exalted above
measure Paul had an
ego just like you and
me sometimes we can think too much of
oursel can't we sure
can verse eight concerning this thing I
pleaded with the Lord three
times now I don't think that was three
quickies do you he spent some time three
different times I imagine fasting and
praying about it that it might depart
from me verse n and he said to me still
in 2 Corinthians 12 he said to me my
grace is sufficient for you God gave him
a revelation God spoke directly to
him my grace is sufficient for you and
listen to this next statement for my
strength is made perfect in weakness I
like you weak just like you are Paul
what I like you
weak listen to me I'm speaking to you he
likes you
weak he likes you
weak stay with me my strength is made
perfect in weakness therefore this is
Paul now therefore most gladly I will
rather boast in my infirmities that the
power of Christ May rest upon me made me
weaker then I might have the
power resting upon me therefore I take
pleasures and infirmities
what I like to be sick or have a
problem what I take Pleasures in
infirmities in reproaches I like it when
people don't like
me in needs I don't have enough to get
to the end of the month and persecutions
what they want to beat me in distresses
I don't know what we're going to do I
got
nothing for Christ's sake for when I am
weak then am
I so you face your
pressing we all face it right we all got
our Gethsemane working on us right now
turn your pray pressing worry that thing
that just keeps coming up in your mind
turn your pressing worry into perceived
power because of your
weakness rejoice in it praise the Lord I
know I'm weak therefore I know God's
coming to help me cuz I got no Calvary
of my
own this Christmas give Jesus your
Gethsemane cup of pressing worry number
last this Christmas give Jesus your
Gethsemane cup of prayerful
worry what's prayerful worry stay with
me we engage in it
regularly prayerful worry Matthew 26 I'm
going to read a little more than I've
got up there Matthew 26 beginning at
verse 37 it says he began to be
sorrowful and deeply distressed you you
mean my Lord and my savior had a moment
of Being
Human I'm glad to hear
it because we've certainly had many of
those moments amen verse 38 then he said
to them my soul
oh this should be my
soul but it was his soul my soul is
exceedingly sorrowful even to death I
could die from
this stay here and watch with me can can
you just don't leave me alone do you
hear
it don't leave me
alone pray with me can you do
that he went a little further not very
far and fell he didn't kneel
down he fell on his
face and prayed say
oh my
father if it is
possible let this cup pass from
me nevertheless and here's the big
kicker not as I will but as you will
whoa see that's the part of praying we
don't like to
pray that one right there especially if
it's a worry verse 40 then he came to
the disciples and found them asleep and
said to Peter what could you not watch
with me one hour Watch and Pray lest you
enter into temptation the spirit indeed
is willing but the flesh is weak again a
second time he went and prayed and away
and prayed saying oh my father if this
cup cannot pass away from me unless I
drink it your will be
done said the same words again verse 45
this is the
spirit
of
prayer give
me I
want if you don't I ain't coming next
week if you don't believe that there are
a lot of people sitting at home cuz they
didn't get what they
wanted God wasn't Santa Claus
and didn't give them that bow wrapped
present of exactly what they wanted when
they wanted it and it was their worrying
how dare God not give me what he I want
who he think he is
god
wow but Jesus taught us to pray your
will be
done what if it's not what I want your
will be done what if that thing that's
worrying me is going to be there
tomorrow your will be
done your will be done what if it's not
going to be removed from me what if it's
going to take me what if I'm going to
suffer can you say that he was your will
be
done have you noticed we tend to pray on
our worry and then we get depressed best
anyway have you noticed
that why do you think that is why do you
think that there are people who can pray
and end up more depressed almost when
they get through than when they
started maybe they've never dealt with
your will be
done never face that they don't know
that they serve a Lord that we're
supposed to say your will be done all
the time 1 Corinthians 4:19 if the Lord
Wills Hebrews 6 5 if God permits that's
the voice of the New Testament if your
will I'll be there if you will it father
I'll go here if you want me to then I'll
do this that's the New Testament over
and over and over again that's the
message of the Old Testament over if
your will Lord willing I don't hear that
like I used to hear it I don't hear
people saying are you coming over to see
us Lord willing I don't hear that much
anymore people think they're going to do
whatever they want to do and they don't
have to ask God for nothing because
they're going to do what they want to do
uh I want to let you in on a little
secret you might
not you might
not maybe that's the reason you're
depressed about it you see he we serve a
god who's known us way before we were
born from the womb Isaiah 49:1 from the
womb I called you Jeremiah chapter 1
verse 5 I knew you before you were
formed in the womb
he's got this whole thing planned out
folks it's his table not mine he's
making a run not me I'm just one little
piece you're just one little piece in
this puzzle and if you think you're
bigger than that you're going to find
out you're
not instead of praying and being
disappointed turn your prayer into God's
plan this is God's
plan James 4: 13-16 come now ye who say
today or tomorrow will go to such and
such a city spend a year there buy and
sell and make a profit whereas you do
not know what will happen tomor instead
you ought to say if the Lord Wills we
shall live We Shall Live we don't even
know we're going to live if the Lord
Wills we shall live and do this or that
but but now you boast in your arrogance
and all such boasting is evil it's evil
it's not just not the smart thing to do
it's
evil turn your prayerful
selfishness and and what I'm saying is
is when the prayer becomes selfish turn
your prayerful selfish
will into a personal submissive prayer
you see if my prayer is prayerful
worrying and I haven't dealt with the
submission the worry is going to
stay so this is it that's the lesson the
Christmas maybe this Christmas you could
give Jesus all your worries and this
would be a blessed Christmas for you all
that practicing worry all that pressing
worry all that prayerful worry Norman
Vincent
pill it's long gone now he said this
there is just one proper time to begin
an effective attack on worry and that's
now start breaking your worry
habit right
now Martin
Luther Martin Luther way back the
reformer he actually struggled with
anxiety he had bouts of anxiety this is
admitted in his
writings you you may not be aware you
you know the diet of worms that's not
eating worms that's the diet at worms
right I hope you know that much history
about it the diet of worms he was they
tried to force him the Catholic Church
tried to force him to renounce his viws
he said something like here I stand I
can do no other he did not renounce his
viws
as soon as he got through he was
supposed to be seen again and but they
whisked him away because they knew that
they were going to kill
him they whisked him away to a remote
Castle
somewhere and in that castle he spent a
lot of time alone he eventually
translated the Bible into German which
is of course what he was he was
German it's a very stressful time
because they the church had condemned
him and he was considered a heretic and
he could have been killed someone could
have found him and killed him he was
alone for most of the days with his
demons as you have
yours his demons and at one point he was
so upset because he was so alone so
isolated knowing everybody just about
acted like they wanted to kill him and
here he sits translating the Bible into
German for his people and at one point
he threw his ink pot across the room
just so frustrated
frustrated and at one time he felt so
much like the worry Devils were
attacking him he screamed out I am
baptized Tim Chester tried to explain
that he says the circumstances looked
Bleak but his baptism was a fact and
embodied the promises of
God maybe sometimes you just need to
say heyy you know I am his I am baptized
I am a Christian I'm not perfect but I
am baptized and I am right with God Amen
sometimes when you're facing the worst
are are you afflicted by anxiety are you
afflicted by wor say it with me say it
with me I am baptized say it with me I
am baptized I am baptized say it again I
am Baptized
you know what that means you are in
Covenant with God unless of course you
sit here today and you've never been
baptized for the mission of your sins
you've got something maybe you should
care
about maybe you should be concerned
about maybe you should be a little
worried
about because you can't actually say in
all honesty I
am
baptized we fix that
you can repent of your sins confess the
name of Christ that you believe he's the
Risen Lord and Savior we can baptize you
in some really cold
water really cold
water it's
Christmas what a great Christmas present
that would be it would remove all your
worries if you're willing the invitation
is yours why we stand and while we sing
