So tonight I wanted to talk about
this.
We all know that uh that movie, right?
Yeah. I can see your freedom. I want to
talk about freedom. I love that you just
saw the picture and knew exactly what I
was going to talk about, right? Um how
does it go again? Uh you'll never take
our lives, but you can take our lives,
but you can take our freedom, right? So
um I really wanted to dive into this
idea of freedom. And to start off, I'd
like to first say, you know, living in
America, the one thing I really do
appreciate and one thing I admire is the
Constitution and the First Amendment. I
really
Bible's the greatest book ever written.
And second, in my opinion, is definitely
the Constitution. Uh the foresight those
men had I would argue was some divine
intervention there, right?
this freedom of speech that we talk
about, this freedom that we all search
for and and having visited about 20 to
30 countries in my life, I I've I've
been able to see how different countries
operate and I think what we have here in
the first amendment, this freedom of
speech is phenomenal. Um, you know, it's
the idea to encourage the exchange of
ideas. Um, and I was thinking we should
be bold to risk being offended in the
pursuit of truth. Also perhaps risk
being offensive in the dissemination of
truth, right? Because I believe that
when dialogue and discussion and debate
um, ceases, I think that's when death
occurs. And so I think this is such a
wonderful thing, this freedom of speech,
right? And I wanted to take you down to
1st Samuel chapter 17. and what we've
been doing with the youth. Um, we've
been going through book by book. I'm I'm
really proud of the youth. We have gone
word for word through a lot of books in
the Bible. Um, I think we're up to like
between 15 or 20 books of the Bible. And
I'm talking Genesis and Exodus and we
did Judges. We, you know, we saw the
carnage of Judges. But I want to take
you to 1st Samuel 17. We all know David
and Goliath. And I want to just
highlight
the scripture here. So we all know David
and Goliath. Goliath is a huge huge guy
um compared to the rest of them. He's
terrifying. The uh the Israelites are
terrified of the Philistines because of
this guy who comes out every day and
taunts them,
right? And the whole army is terrified
of this. And then you got this little
boy who shows up. And according to
Josephus, he's around 13 years old.
Could argue he's probably a little bit
older or maybe even younger. But he
shows up and he sees this and he's like,
"Who's this guy?"
Right? And hey, I'll deal with this. And
so, uh, I'm going to read from verse 41
and then we'll get into verse 45. But
David and Goliath meet each other in the
valley.
And in verse 41 it says, "The Philistine
with his shieldbearer walking in front
of him kept coming closer to David. And
when the Philistine looked carefully at
David, he despised him for he was only a
ruddy and handsome boy." That word boy
there.
The Philistine said to David, "Am I a
dog that you that you are coming after
me with sticks?"
Then the Philistine cursed David by his
guards.
And the Philistines said to David, "Come
here to me so I can give your flesh to
the birds of the sky and the wild
animals of the field."
It's a nice interaction, right?
You ever been intimidated like this?
Anybody that you've kind of been a bit
scared of and yeah, I want to get out of
this situation.
Then we have this little boy in the
story,
right? Most of us can't even tie our
shoelaces. This guy is standing up to
the warrior of this army, right?
And his response, but David replied to
the Philistine, "You are coming against
me with sword and spear and javelin,
but I am coming against you in the name
of the Lord of heaven's armies." Amen.
Right. the God of Israel's armies, whom
you have defied.
This very day, the Lord will deliver you
into my hand.
I will strike you down and cut off your
head. I wonder if David's voice is
broken yet,
right?
Just to add insult to injury.
But the confidence behind David, the
faith
and he and he he doesn't come all about
him.
I am coming against you in the name of
the Lord.
In verse 46, this very day the Lord will
deliver you into my hand. I will strike
you down and cut off your head. I can
imagine him looking up this giant. I'm
going to strike you down and cut off
your head.
This day I will give the corpses of the
Philistine army to the birds of the sky
and the wild animals of the land.
Then all the land will realize that
Israel has a god. And all this assembly
will know that it is not by sword or
spear that the Lord saves. For the
battle of the is the Lord's and he will
deliver you into our hand.
Confidence is remarkable.
I would argue this probably would not be
me.
But we talk about confidence and
something we didn't talk about in the
youth class here and I want to get into
it is the freedom that David has
this freedom in God that we see. Um I
want to highlight
his freedom from fear and anxiety.
We know that fear can grip I should stop
shouting. Sorry the rain stopped there.
Um, we know that fear in our lives can
grip us. We all struggle with fear.
We're nervous of things. We're fearful
of new ventures or or change.
We're fearful of what might happen to us
physically, harm.
But what we see here with David
is a faith that delivers him from this
fear. In 2 Timothy 1:7 it says, "For God
has not given us a spirit of fear, but
of power and of love and a and of a
sound mind."
Isaiah 41:10, "So do not fear, for I am
with you. Do not be dismayed, for I am
your God. I will strengthen you and help
you. I will uphold you with my righteous
uh right hand."
In Psalm 34:4, I sought the Lord and he
answered me. He delivered me from all my
fears. There's a couple other scriptures
up there. I'm not going to go through
all of them, but God delivers us from
our fears. David as a boy has had time
to be in God's creation, to be a
shepherd, to to learn how to handle
lions and bears and and from a young
boy, right?
And so he understands the power of God.
He understands this relationship with
God. And he knows he doesn't have to be
fearful. He doesn't have to be anxious.
Uh Psalm 55:22, "Cast your cares on the
Lord and he will sustain you. He will
never let the righteous be shaken."
Matthew 6:34, "Therefore, do not worry
about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry
about itself. Each day has enough
trouble of its own." Isaiah 26:3, "You
will keep in perfect peace those whose
minds are steadfast because they trust
in you.
David shows freedom in obedience here
and the community.
So I find it interesting here this this
community idea. Um
there's a time when we stand up for one
another.
There's a time when we stand next to one
another. There's a time when we stand in
the gap for the ones who are weak.
Right? I know my responsibility is look
after my family and stand in that gap
for the innocent and the weak, right?
But freedom from obedience. Now,
obedience is interesting because we hear
Paul talk about slaves. We're slaves to
righteousness. Dulos 124 times is
mentioned this idea that we are slaves.
So, how can you be free and be a slave?
Well, the idea is that we're either
slaves to sin or we're slaves to
righteousness. And from my experience in
this world, I I choose righteousness
because that's what I want. And if I
want it, how can I be a slave to that?
Right? But in a weird way,
paradoxically, I am a slave to God in
this free environment, right?
And so obedience, uh, John 14:15,
if you love me, keep my commandments.
1 Peter 2:16, "Live as free people, but
do not use your freedom as a cover up
for evil, live as God's slaves."
Interesting way to put that. John
8:31:32, "To the Jews who had believed
him, Jesus said, "If you hold to my
teaching, you are really my disciples.
Then you will know the truth, and the
truth will set you free."
Acts 5:29, Peter and the other apostles
replied, "We must obey God rather than
human beings." There is freedom in
obedience to God.
And David knew this, right?
David's in obedience to God fighting
against the Philistine.
freedom in that community that I talked
about. Um
we when we stand with one another, when
we stand in that gap,
Galatians 6:2, carry each other's
burdens, and in this way, you will
fulfill the law of Christ.
I love the community that we have.
There's a peace here. We come on Sunday
mornings and Wednesdays and Sunday
nights, but we have relationship with
one another. And I was talking to a a
Christian friend of mine um yesterday.
Okay. He worships over in Orlando
and we were just talking about he's from
Australia and we're talking about other
friends that we have from Australia that
are here but are not Christian
and we're talking about do we see them
often. I was like I don't really have
anything in common. They're nice guys
but all we do is talk about cricket,
right? You all know cricket. Good.
But truly, I want to be with people like
you who who think deeply about the
world, who think about God, who want
God, who want to know about him, who
want to talk more about him, who want
relationship with him. I love that. I
know Sean loves that. We we've had a few
dinners where we really crave that that
um conversation about God and and deep
stuff, right? And so, I love this
community that we have.
Uh Hebrews 10:24-25. And let us consider
how we spur one another on toward love
and good deeds, not giving up meeting
together as someone in the habit of
doing, but encouraging one another. And
all the more as you see the day
approaching. Ephesians 4:3, make every
effort to keep the unity of the spirit
through the bond of peace. in 1
Thessalonians 5:11. Therefore, encourage
one another and build each other up just
as in fact you are doing.
So that was just in that small little
paragraph that I picked up with David.
But the obvious one that we talk about
is freedom of sin. Freedom from sin.
Freedom from sin through grace.
Let's be honest. When we sin,
it chews away that conscience and we sin
a little bit more and I choose away a
little bit more and I sin and oops, now
I'm in real trouble. And you know what?
Sometimes I feel embarrassed. I don't
want to go to church. I feel like a
hypocrite. So, I don't want to go to
church. I'm I'm going to stay away and
I'm going to get my life in order. I'll
deal with it myself. I'll fix it myself.
I'll be back next week.
I I I couldn't do it by myself.
And so, do you think I went the next
week? No. And I find myself in the
spiral,
right? And sin, I become a slave to sin.
And the reality is, I'm no longer a
slave to sin. I'm free because of him.
Right? Thank goodness.
The sin that holds me down, I am free
from it. I am a new person. I'm not
dragging this old body with this idea
that Paul says you know deliver me from
this body of death that that the Romans
if
uh for example I murdered uh let's talk
about where's Harrison he's not here I
murdered Harrison right I'll take on the
big guy and I get caught they would tie
his dead body to me as a punishment
right and I drag this dead body around
so this is idea that Paul's saying how
do I get rid of
freedom of speech. I can challenge
Harrison,
but I'm free from that now.
Uh 1 John 1:9, if we confess our sins,
he is faithful and just and will forgive
us of our sins and pur purify us from
all unrighteousness. Romans 6:22, "But
now that you have been set free from sin
and have become slaves of God, the
benefit you reap leads to holiness, and
the result is eternal life."
John 1:29. The next day, John saw Jesus
coming toward him and said, "Look, the
lamb of God who takes away the sin of
the world." Amen. I'm so relieved
that I'm free from that mess. And yes, I
know we fall into that, but we have a
savior who we can go back to. We can
turn back to because of this grace that
we have. And I think of Peter.
Peter denied Christ three times. Judas
took money and we know what Judas did.
He betrayed Christ.
Both disciples, both baptized, both
walked with Jesus, both tal, you know,
saw him teaching, saw the miracles. Same
guy, different outcome. both betrayed
him.
Peter or Judas tried to do it on his
own. Didn't work out. Peter turns back
to God. He knows that grace. He
understands that. And so we see this
freedom. Uh Ephesians 1:7. In him we
have redemption through his blood, the
forgiveness of sins in accordance with
the riches of God's grace. Romans 5:20,
the law was brought in so that the
trespass might increase. But when sin
increased, grace increased all the more.
2 Timothy 1:9, he has saved us and
called us to a holy life, not because of
anything that we have done, but because
of his own purpose and grace. This grace
was given us in Christ Jesus before the
beginning of time.
And finally my last point here
freedom in Christ to serve.
Often when we talk about freedom in
Christ we talk about we are free from
death.
Now obviously we die
but we know that there is life after
death. Now I am free from that fear of
death.
A uh the time is just a passing moment,
a change of location, change of address,
right? I think of the movie Paul. If
you've ever watched the movie The
Apostle Paul, so powerful. Please go
watch it if you get a chance. But
there's a a moment where Luke uh is
sitting with some of the Christians that
are about to go into Nero's circus, be
eaten by lions or whatever it might be.
And it's terrifying. Christians are
being persecuted.
And uh Luke's car or Luke says to them
um it'll just be a moment. It'll be a
moment and we're there and we're so
comforting in such a horrible terrible
scenario.
So we have this freedom in Christ.
Freedom from death. Uh John 8:36. So the
sun sets you free. So if the son sets
you free, you will be free indeed.
Galatians 5:1. It is for freedom that
Christ has set us free. Stand firm then
and do not let yourselves be burdened
again by a yoke of slavery. Romans
8:1-2. Therefore, there is now no
condemnation for those who are in Christ
Jesus. Because through Christ Jesus, the
law of the spirit who gives life has set
you free from the law of sin and death.
The reason I want to bring that one up,
freedom from death.
I pray this never happens to us, but if
you've read your Bible, you know about
persecution. If you've read your Bible,
you know there's something coming
that could be horrendous.
And I would like to think
that I am so grounded in faith and so
grounded in God. And I'm so grounded in
this freedom that he gives us that when
I'm challenged to denounce him, I stand
firm in him because I'm not afraid of
death.
Right?
Freedom to serve.
We have to serve. We need to serve.
Part of our freedom is to serve.
Galatians 5:13, you are my brothers and
sisters. Uh you my brothers and sisters
were called to be free but do not use
your freedom to indulge in the flesh.
Rather serve one another humbly in love.
Matthew 20:26 28 not so with you.
Instead whoever wants to become great
among you must be your servant. And
whoever wants to be first must be your
slave. Just as the son of man did not
come to be served but to serve and as to
give his life as a ransom for many.
And I'll finish with 1 John 3:18. Dear
children, let us not love with words or
speech, but with actions and in truth.
It's a simple lesson, but it's a good
reminder that we are free. We truly are
free. And I and I I come back. I love
the first amendment. But if one day
something were to happen to this country
and those freedoms were taken away, I
implore you to understand that you are
still free. You are still free to speak
out, to speak the truth, and don't be
afraid of death. Don't be afraid of of
persecution.
We have a savior who rose from the dead.
It's done. It's complete.
I would argue the only power that the
devil is afraid of is Christianity.
So don't be afraid. We are free. Be
excited about that. Um
be free
if you want to be free. If you need to
be free, we can help you be free. Come
as we stand and sing.
