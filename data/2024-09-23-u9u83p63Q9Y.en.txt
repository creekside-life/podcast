so we're looking at in this series The
Soul's challenge of attending all
services we're looking at the Soul's
commitment
today before we do that let's begin with
a word of prayer pray with
me our Holy
Father uh we always need your help so we
ask you to help us to be
faithful help us to be faithful in
attendance help us be faithful in our
life in every way
but let it begin
here help us to be committed in our life
in every way to our family our work our
responsibilities but let that begin here
in our attendance and our commitment to
you help us father to be more than just
willing to pay the
cost when it's asked help us to go ahead
and make that commitment now that we
will do our best no father we will do
more than that we will just commit to
attend to attend it every opportunity we
have and then when we don't have
opportunities we will make
opportunities bless us in this study
father help us to see what you would
have us see Enlighten our eyes
and make our
heart moved to make that commitment we
just spoke to you about it's in Jesus
name we pray
Amen in preparation for this lesson
weeks and weeks ago when I was asked to
start a series on this began studying
about Sunday nights
particularly and as I studied that I'm
going to be real honest with you I
actually got
angry and I stayed angry for a couple of
days
because I felt like suddenly realized
that I'd been lied to and that I'd
believe something that maybe you had
believed as well and it was quite
upsetting when I realized it now I
either was lied to or it was
ignorance but in either case it was a
true what had been
taught the liberal gurus of my
day have told me that we should go ahead
and just abandon evening worships
because there really just a recent
Innovation and they're really created
because of electricity being available
and or gas where we could have lighting
outside and then finally in buildings
and that the elders were really the ones
that just came up with this and
therefore it's not significant and I
read to you last week about a comment
that John Mark Hicks made retired
professor at Libs University which by
the way I don't mean to be ugly but I
would have to say that I would consider
him slightly liberal he said revivalism
in the late 19th century this direct
quote and the rise of better
lighting encouraged Sunday evening
Gatherings for Evangelistic preaching
and then shift work during World War I
and World War II encourag Sunday
evenings for those who miss this became
standard in the
1940s and maybe like you I believe that
story Church growth gurus also
said it's really too much to ask people
to attend more than one time a week so
let's focus on the one we're all so busy
in our culture so let's focus on the one
we can get a lot of people to that and
that's all that really
matters because it's not really
something we need worry about it's just
a tradition
anyway and I believe
that then there were ignorant
theologians and those gurus so you had
the liberal gurus Church growth gurus
and the liberal Theologian gurus that
said well you know the fourth
Commandment was
abrogated and that there's really no
need to respect the example of the
Sabbath day
and I believe
that I'm going to tell you something my
father's been dead almost 40
years my father does not rule my
life but you know what I'm a lot like my
father and I still do a lot of the
things that he taught me to do almost as
if I'm being told to do it even to this
day I was raised you say yes sir yes
ma'am hold the door warful ladies and a
number of other things that he taught me
to do and I do them now like I'm obeying
him might catch my drift on the Sabbath
and what really happened instead of what
you've been told what
happened we were not taught the biblical
basis for morning and evening service at
least I
wasn't I
wasn't just went along with what I
assumed right but the first law and its
Commandments need to be paid attention
to while not in
force they are to be a guide to us and
the old testate Jewish sabbath worship
was meant to be a guide to the church
and by the way since the vast majority
of the early members of the church were
Jews what do you think they
did Romans 15 and verse4 said this for
whatever things were written before were
written for our learning this is in
reference to the Old Testament they were
written so that you would learn it why
would you need to learn it well he tells
you that we through the patience and
comfort of scriptures might have hope it
was not meant to be ignored because now
we're under the New Testament it was
meant to be paid attention to in 1
Timothy 3: 15-1 17 it's actually a
discussion not of the New Testament
scriptures but of the Old Testament
scriptures when it says all scripture
referring predominantly obviously to the
Old Testament but also to anything that
might have been written at that point
but all scripture is given by
inspiration of God and is profitable for
doctrine that means teaching so you can
teach with the old testment T right
absolutely for reprove for correction
for instruction in righteousness that
the man of God may be complete
thoroughly equipped for every good work
why would you teach Old Testament
teachings so you would be equipped for
every good work Colossians 2: 16 and 17
says this so let no one judge you
regarding a festival or sabbaths which
are a shadow of things to come but the
substances of Christ so so the lurgical
regulations for both
morning and evening
sacrifices were
explicit in the Old Testament on the
Sabbath day did you hear what I just
said there was no such thing as Sabbath
day Worship in the Old Testament that
didn't recognize that there was a
special early morning service and a
special evening service let me read it
to you numbers
28:4 the one lamb you shall offer in the
morning and the other lamb you shall
offer in the
evening interesting
hey that wasn't discussed in the
discussion of Sunday night but I'm not
through I'm just getting warmed
up second The inspir Inspired
recommendations were not what I was
discussed with Psalm 92 Psalm 92 this is
an inspired recommend ation Psalm 92: 1
and 2 it has a preamble to it so we know
by the way the preambles are inspired as
well as far as we understand it and it
says it's a Psalm a song for the Sabbath
day so for the day of worship here's
what it says you need to think about
verse one it is good to give thanks to
the Lord and to sing praises to your
name oh most high so on the day of
worship it was good to sing praises to
God that's called worship right then he
goes on verse two to declare your loving
kindness in the morning and your
faithfulness every
night did you just hear that Old
Testament worship Worship in the
morning worship at tonight offer the
sacrifice in the morning offer the
sacrifice at night did you ever hear
that discuss neither did I and thirdly
the New Testament evening worship
example is clear on the what we might
call the Christian Sabbath Now call
Sunday acts 20: 7 we just read it now on
the first day of the week when the
disciples came together to break bread
Paul continued his message until
midnight so this was at night wasn't it
so what might be called the first
Sunday
service
ever happened at
night and the Lord attended it John 20
verse
19 then the same day at
evening being the first day of the week
when the doors were shut where the
disciples were assembled for fear of the
Jews Jesus came I think he shows up
Sunday night by the way Jesus came and
stood in the in the midst and said to
them peace be to you or with you now the
fourth little thing that I wasn't really
talked to about and that's the sacred
morning and evening moments I had never
considered it it never been something
that I really thought a lot about but
the sacred morning and evening Jesus
rose from the dead in the
morning on what day Sunday morning
that's right
but when was he
born in the
evening when did he go to
Gethsemane in the evening when did he
Institute the Lord's Supper by the way
it's not called a a Lord's
breakfast it's the Lord's
Supper Luke 22:20 likewise he also took
the cup after supper even later I guess
saying this cup is the New Covenant in
my blood which is shed for
you there's something
appropriate that I never heard even
discussed this way something appropriate
to never forget the sacred
moments but fifth the consistent witness
of the Christian
tradition how
early did Sunday night start
hm did you ever hear that
discussed H we act like it came in the
20th century when we got
electricity uh acts 20: 7 was not the
20th
century and they had lights in the upper
room and they had people falling asleep
too so just like
now
eus eus of cesaria died in 339 ad so
somewhere before 339 maybe 300 maybe two
something he said this for it is surely
no small sign of God's power that
through the whole world in the Churches
of God at the morning rising of the sun
and the evening hours hymns praises and
truly Divine Delights are offered to God
God's Delights are indeed the hymn set
up everywhere on Earth in his church at
the Times of morning and
evening so by my account let's just say
that was
new that's still
like 1700 years
ago but more the medieval Church
certainly did it uh the English Puritans
did it the the Scottish Presbyterians
did it the anglicans did it the Dutch
reform did it did it the Scottish
Presbyterians did it the English
Puritans did it the lutherans did it the
anglicans did it it was a part of
mainstream protestantism not just
Catholicism 1 Corinthians 4:1 17 it
makes me kind of go like this where did
this come from because it's not from the
20th
century where did it come
from how old is it 1 Corinthians 4:17 I
have sent Timothy to you who is my
beloved and faithful son in the Lord who
will remind you of my ways in Christ as
I teach everywhere in every church let
me tell you what I do know whatever was
taught to that New Testament Church was
taught to every single one of those New
Testament churches and every one of them
thought that's what they were to do
that's what I do know
six and this may be the most important
the dumbing down of the church should
alarm us
all it isn't appropriate to try to get
the church to the lowest common
denominator let's make it as little
church as we can is that the goal is the
goal to reduce it Hebrews 5:12 says by
this time you ought to be teachers you
need someone to teach you again the
first principles of the Oracles of God
you know if you just let let it drag
soon we won't be doing anything you
realize that right we won't be here on a
Sunday either you just start letting it
drag there won't be
anything Robert Godfrey I read his quote
last week Dr Robert Godfrey he said when
um should we have two service on the
Lord's day he said my inclination when
somebody says that is to say that I
think we as the people of God ought to
rise up in righteous revolt and say why
can't we have
three the day Belongs to the Lord after
all Revelation 1:10 it doesn't say I was
in the spirit on the Lord's
morning I was in the spirit on the
Lord's
day so here here's what I want you to
think about so I'm giving you some
things just to think about okay cuz I
had thought about it either and I bet
you haven't either all the things cuz I
I kind of believed all those girls I
thought they knew what they were talking
about you know you expect people to tell
you the truth right and never heard it
discussed really right so that's where I
was at so it got to me to thinking what
if I was a Jew and I'd obeyed the gospel
in 33
ad and I'd been used to morning and
evening and all day service on the
Sabbath right and that's what I'd always
known and now I'm being taught to follow
Jesus and I'm being encouraged don't
even worry about you you don't even have
to come regular on
Sunday you don't even have to be there's
certainly no don't worry about I know
there's sh in synagogue but we're not
going to have sh we're not going to have
school Sunday school no no we're going
to do that and we're not going to have
Sunday night no no no we're not going to
do that we're just going to meet one
time on Sunday that ought to be enough I
can't imagine it see I've been a
dedicated Jew and now I'm a Christian
what would be my
Norm where do you think this came from
I want to tell you something our elders
didn't invent
it so but I want to go somewhere else so
that's just the introduction wish that
was probably the end of the sermon but
that's just the introduction we're not
going to get in the meat of the lesson
so the meat of the lesson is this
there's more serious reasons for not
giving up on any of our
services Sunday school Sunday night
Wednesday night we have services for
other things listen to it again I'm
going to read it over and over again I'm
just preaching one little simple lesson
today you may think it's going to be
complic this is really a really simple
lesson today and that is you shall have
no other gods before
you so let's look at three of
those number one regarding all church
services we must not give equal status
to other
you shall have no
other no equal
status there is no equality with God
period Luke 14:26 if anyone comes to me
and does not hate his father and mother
and wife and children brothers and
sisters yes
and his own life also he cannot be my
disciple there is no other he's
it there is no other listen to First
Kings 18:21 and Elijah came to all the
people and said how long will you falter
between two
opinions if the Lord is God follow him
but if Baal follow him make up your
mind but the people answered him not a
word that's the tendency of a all so a
truly I think the message is so clear a
truly dedicated disciple of Christ has
no other thing equal to worshiping God
on
Sunday has no other thing equal to God
than worshiping Sunday
night has no other thing equal to God
than going to Sunday school has no other
thing equal to God than going on
Wednesday night you tell me has no other
thing equal so regarding all church
services we must not give equal status
to other what's the other well you name
it uh well we just want to spend time
with our family oh we like sports we're
going to a game hey we're going to go
down the beach today we just want to
relax I'm really tired it's been a long
day we're going to have some fun find
some friends over oh I have to work
today oh we're going out Town we're on
going to have a vacation oh we're
traveling oh we're just going to have a
little fun today have a little
Recreation that's
other by
definition it's other the second lesson
simple lesson regarding all church
services we must not give Divine status
to other it says you shall have no other
gods Divine
beings Divine things there is no other
Divinity you realize that
right there's nothing else that's Divine
1 Corinthians 8: 5 and 6 says for even
if there are so called
Gods verse six says yet for us there is
one God how many gods are there Brethren
one God there only one Divine being
there is no other ma Matthew 4:10 Jesus
talking to the
devil then Jesus said to him away with
you
Satan for it is written you shall
Worship the Lord your God and him
Only You Shall Serve so a truly dedic D
at disciple of Christ has no other
Divine
thing to do on Sunday
evenings regarding all church services
whether we
talking Sunday school Sunday morning
Sunday night Wednesday night you don't
have another Divine thing to
do family is not a Divine thing to do
Sports is not not a Divine thing to
do the beach is not a Divine thing to do
just resting and relaxing is not a
Divine thing to do having Fun's not a
Divine thing to do Recreation is not a
Divine thing to
do number
three regarding all church services we
must not give Superior status to other
follow with me you shall have no other
gods before you before
me there is no other before
God in the life of a Christian a truly
committed Christian if you're truly
committed there is no before
him Matthew 6 and33 but seek first the
kingdom of God and his righteousness and
all these things shall be added to you
what is the first and great commandment
Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
all thy heart what is the first thing
there is no before God there is no other
in Ezekiel 14:3 it says these have set
up their Idols in their heart and put
before them they put them before their
eyes so these are the things that came
before or if God they still considered
God Psalm 96:4 says this the Lord is
great and greatly to be praised he is to
be a fear Above All
Gods so a truly dedicated disciple of
Christ has no other Superior thing to
do no greater thing to do than God and
giving worship to him particularly on
Sunday evenings which has been the real
force of my lesson today because that
didn't just start in the
1900s so regarding all church services
we must not give Superior status to
others whether it's Family Sports Beach
re relaxation fun work Recreation travel
so this is all based on the first
commandment trying to keep first things
first your commitment is based on the
very first
commandment so the first commandment
your Soul's commitment regarding all
church services we must not give equal
status to
other we must not give Divine status to
other we must not give Superior status
to
other fan
I know it's not a word to use that's cor
Greek and it comes from well the English
word for it it's a hymn it's called hell
gladdens light or Hell gladsome
light nobody knows how old this song
is no
one no
one we know that it was printed for
churches to use in the 3D and fourth
Century in a book or a reference the
Constitution On's
apostola we know that it was talked
about by basil the great who lived
somewhere between 330 and
379 but he spoke about it as a leading
clergyman if you will he spoke about it
as if it was ancient and from
Antiquities the best Among Us trying to
figure out when it came from it was in
existence at least around 150 ad already
in existence and the one of the reasons
they know that because it's written in
the co
Greek so it's written at the time if you
will about the time many of the
scriptures were just being finished
here's what it
says oh gladsome light of the Holy glory
of the immortal father holy blessed
Jesus
Christ now that we have come to the
setting of The
Sun behold the light of evening we
praise God the Father Son and Holy
Spirit it is good at all times to
worship thee with voices of Praise oh
son of God and Giver of Life all the
world do glorify
thee H so taste and
see evening worship touches another
place in your
soul morning worship is
wonderful Jesus rose from the dead
Sunday morning about
daylight but there's nothing like Sunday
nights the close of the day on the day
that belongs to
him I think I've always enjoyed evening
Services
better I don't know why but it's
something about having caps cap the day
for him finishing the day starting it
with him and finishing the day with
him there's a greater Fellowship here on
Sunday night you may you may think this
is the real close bonding time
I've never experienced
that I experienced the Sunday night
service the Wednesday night service
there's a closer Bond it's more
relaxed more
buddy more we're on the same
team I don't think you should miss any
service I'm not trying to put one down
I'm for them all but I'm afraid I'm
afraid
we've not been taught the importance of
Sunday night I don't think we've been T
taught the importance of Sunday morning
we still have people that come like once
a
month we got people that don't won't go
to Sunday school this
morning we got people that wouldn't come
if we had a gospel meeting if if the
Lord Jesus was preaching in
it at some
point no other God must come before it
no other
God
nothing
no
other how clear can that be
no other what's your other get rid of
it make a commitment right
