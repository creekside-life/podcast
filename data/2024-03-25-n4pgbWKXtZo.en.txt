this lesson kind of sets the stage for
why Christ death burial and Resurrection
is so
important it literally the resurrection
is the proof that's in the pudding about
what we're talking about today why did a
man a pure
man a sinless man a Divine man a man
from heaven but born of a woman but not
of a
man why did he have to come from heaven
and down across to save
us I think that question's not asked
enough do we have inherited Tendencies
due to the knowledge of Good and
Evil we want to believe that all humans
especially me are good and Noble and
that we just give us a moment and I'll
prove it to you but I'm afraid I've
proved the opposite too
often nobody wants to think that I'm
sinful or that you're sinful or Wicked
we don't want to think
that and nobody wants to talk about Sin
anymore they don't want to even discuss
it it's where we live now in the early
1960s Hannah Arden was a political
writer and she wrote about the trial of
Adolf anman Adolf anman was a German
officer during World War II who
orchestrated much of what we call today
the
Holocaust in
1934 Adolf akman was appointed to take
care of the Jewish section of Security
Services of the
SS he became deeply involved in
formulating what was later called the
final solution to the Jewish question
which was to eliminate to eliminate them
he drew upon the ideas of deportation of
Jews into
ghettos he gathered train cars which
were really hard to find at the time
because they were being used for the war
effort he gathered them up to get the
Jews into concentration camps and he did
it with
murderous
Effectiveness he actually took great
pride in the fact that he was able to
kill 6 million Jews and Europeans
of various
sorts under questioning akman claimed to
not be
anti-semitic he merely carried out his
assigned duties therefore he was a
bureaucrat not really having done
anything wrong he had not violated any
law of his
country he said that he was the kind of
man who could not tell a
lie he talked about his responsibility
and he denied his responsibility in the
mass killings he said I couldn't help
myself I had orders but I had nothing to
do with that business I never claimed
not to know about the liquidation I only
said that Bureau 4 B4 that's amman's
office had nothing to do with
it akman professed personal discomfort
actually with hearing about how the
gassing went on he said I was horrified
my nerves aren't strong enough I can't
listen to such things such things
without their effect on me I couldn't
stand it his observations of the gassing
he was forced one time to observe some
of it and he says this I didn't look
inside I couldn't couldn't what I saw
and heard was enough the screaming and
it was much too shaken for me I'm too
tender
denying his ultimate
responsibilities he actually seemed to
be proud of the effectiveness
particularly of being able to gather all
the cattle cars to take the people
there the trial lasted from April of
1961 to December 15th 1961 and Adolf
Amman was found guilty sentenced to
death the only person sentenced to death
by Israel he's hanged May the 3D 196
try it again I think I already said that
number
one we do inherit the curse of
sin that is sin's death you inherit it
there's no question about it it has
passed to you and me but the tree of the
knowledge of Good and Evil Genesis
21:17 you shall not eat for in the day
that you eat of it you shall surely die
Genesis 3 16-9 I'll just pick up a
couple of places 17 says to Adam he said
cursed is the ground you need to
remember that the ground you stand on is
cursed never forget it that's not a mbel
thing this story in the garden is not
make believe this is real cursed is the
ground for your sake in toil you shall
eat of it all the days of your life bet
you caught on to you had to do that in
the sweat of your face you shall eat
bread there's stress involved in work
till you return to the ground that's
where you're going that's where I'm
going for out of it you were taken for
dust you are and to dust you shall
return you go back to the cursed
ground that's the truth Romans 5:12 puts
it this way just as through one man sin
entered the world that's Adam and death
through
sin and thus death death spread to all
men because all
sinned that's true Romans 6:23 puts it
this way for the wages of sin
is class for the wages of sin is that
yeah but the gift of God is eternal life
in Christ Jesus our savior we are under
that curse there is no way we can escape
it did we inherit sin and death yes
anyone ever not sinned or died do you
know anybody that live that did not sin
or
die it passed upon
us we tend to
Die inheriting the curse of sin sin's
death you say well the curse doesn't
fall on children are you serious we bury
children I've buried eight or 10 babies
in my
Ministry number
two we do inherit the contamination of
sin that is sin's
disposition it's there in Genesis 2:1 17
says but of the tree of the knowledge of
Good and Evil you shall not eat for in
the day that you eat eat of it you shall
surely
die we know and we know we
know we
actually everybody on the planet knows
good and evil
everybody Genesis 3:7 says then the eyes
of both of them were opened I don't know
how this works sounds interesting though
it's like their eyes were closed but now
they're opened and they knew that they
were naked imagine that not knowing that
something changed something radically
changed in them that is with us we have
the knowledge of Good and Evil and we
cannot Escape that concept it is with us
we have it Romans 3:10 says as it is
written there is none righteous no not
one they have all
all turned
aside for all verse 23 have sinned and
fall short of the glory of God how many
have sinned
all we lean into
it Romans 5: 19 says for as by one man's
Disobedience many were made sinners wait
a minute wait wait wait wait they were
made Sinners by his act yes so also by
one man's obedience many will be made
righteous praise God for that did we
inherit this knowledge do we all know
good and evil and
can we do
both yes so that hereditarily totally
depraved you're incap AP aable of doing
good so that's not
correct that's not the truth but do we
sin and do we all do it yes so we're
disposed to sin however you want to look
at that however you feel comfortable I
know some of you are sitting there
trying to figure out why I'm wrong and I
got to have a conversation with him
afterwards but just hold
it we are disposed to sin we have
inherited the contamination of sin sin
is
our
disposition and you can't escape it and
neither can I not now anyway number
three we do inherit the corruption of
sin that is sin's
depravity sins depravity and yes I use
that word intentionally in G Genesis 4:
1-8 I'll just read beginning of verse
three and in the process of time it came
to pass that Cain brought an offering of
the fruit of the ground to the Lord have
you ever thought about that just a
second why was that not the one he liked
remember what happened to the
ground where you're going to
go and you're a part of it it was cursed
you remember that verse four and Abel
also brought of the firstborn of his
flock and of their fat that's a
plurality he offered several animals
apparently and the Lord respected Abel
in his offering but he did not respect
Cain in his offering and Cain was very
angry and his countenance fell so the
Lord said to Cain why are you angry if
you do well so he's still capable of
doing well I thought everybody that was
red Jered tolded pray couldn't do well
if you do well you could do that if you
do well you uh will you not be accepted
you can do the right thing and God will
accept you and if you do not do well sin
lies at the door it's like crouching at
the door waiting to jump on you and you
know it it's around you all the time and
its desire is for you it wants to
control you and you've let it control
you before and you know it don't look at
me funny every last one of us sitting
here have let sin control us at
times it's desires for you but you
should rule over it so you are not to
let it rule you but you've let it rule
you and you know you have so don't smirk
and say I'm not like that yes you
are verse eight Cain rose up against
Abel his brother and killed him I think
he let sin rule him what do you think
killed his
brother did we inherit this did did the
world and the ground and the men and all
the
minds did they turn vile unclean and did
their thinking go
kooky Genesis 6: 5-6 then the Lord saw
the wickedness of man was great in the
earth and that every intent of the
thoughts of his heart was only evil
continually oh our world is not evil
continually
really oh and I don't think evil
really our world is filled with sin is
the point that I want you to
get Romans 1: 8-31 I'll just read a
couple of places verse 21 says although
they knew knew God they did not glorify
him as God nor were thankful that's
people who knew God not people who
didn't know God but people who knew
God people like like you that go to
church but became futile in their
thoughts so you mean church folks can go
off in their thinking oh yeah easier
than you think became futile in their
thoughts and their foolish heart was
darkened that's what happens you get
really dumber and meaner and crazier as
you go believe me I've been there verse
24 therefore God also gave them up to
uncleanness so God can let go of you and
you will really get into it oh yeah if
God is not protecting you you really go
down a path verse 26 and God gave them
up to vile passions you mean you can go
so far that it just fills your life and
you're full of vile passion oh yes that
can happen to any of us if we walk down
that pathway Romans 8: 20-22 it says
this for the creation that's the whole
world the world that God made in its all
of its goodness for the creation was
subjected to
futility oh yeah not
willingly the creation didn't vote on
this but because of him who subjected it
in hope God allowed this to happen
because he had a plan because the
creation itself also will be delivered
from the bondage of corruption which
it's all around us into the Glorious
Liberty of the children of God Amen
corrupt men corrupt women are
everywhere we are surrounded by sin we
have inherited as a result the
corruption that's in the world all
around us and depravity is everywhere
and to not recognize that is to be
slightly ignorant
but you have no excuse because you have
a knowledge of Good and Evil number
next we do inherit the culture of sin
that is sin's
Damages and boy are there
damages in Exodus 20: 4-6 it says this
you shall not make for yourself a carved
image or any likeness of anything that
is in heaven above or that is in the
earth beneath or that is in the water
under the earth now verse five I think
that's the one you have up there you
shall not bow down to them nor serve
them for I the Lord your God am a
jealous God here's where it gets to your
passage visiting the iniquity of the
fathers on to the children to the third
and the fourth generation of those who
hate me oh yes we live in a culture of
sin that damages us and it rolls down
heal on us from our parents our parents
sins affect us
still don't think moms and dads your sin
isn't affecting your children it's
damaging them we've all been damaged by
it I promise you I've been damaged by
the sins of my parents Deuteronomy 24
and and they don't like to hear that
Deuteronomy 24 4 16 fathers shall not be
put to death for their children wait a
second I thought you just said nor shall
children be put to death for their
fathers I thought you just said that we
don't pay for the sins of our parents
that's right we don't that way we are
not put to death for him a person shall
be put to death for his own sins that's
right that's 100%
true do we inherit a culture that loves
sin that damages all of us yes do we
inherit as a result of our parents sins
trouble oh
yeah
absolutely to the third and fourth
generation yeah by the way good kind of
does that too by the way it passes down
too Hebrews chap 7: 9 and 10 it says
even Levi who received tithes paid tith
through Abraham so to speak how could
that happen it says it in verse 10 for
he was still in the loins of his father
when m kic met him who would have
thought that the curse passed through
the fathers not the mothers that's
interesting but not the
guilt are you following
me it wasn't the guilt I'm not guilty
because my father drank too much I'm not
an
alcoholic but I've been damaged by
it Matthew chapter 18: 3 and 10 says
this unless you're converted and become
as little children wait a
minute
they're they they don't need to be
converted little children don't need to
be converted we need to be converted and
become like little children that's right
they don't need to be converted why
because they we're not hereditarily
totally depraved we're not in sin we're
don't we're not lost that way that's not
the message I'm giving today I want you
to understand though the damage is is
serious Little Children You Won't by no
means enter the Kingdom of Heaven unless
you become like a little child verse 10
says take heed that you do not despise
one of these little ones for I say to
you that in heaven their Angels always
see the face of my father who's in
heaven little
children are sinless they're innocent
how do I know that Psalm 106: 38 says
shed innocent blood the blood of their
sons they shed innocent blood the blood
of their sons and their daughters you
see there is such a thing as innocence
and they have it
but I don't
anymore I don't
anymore we are harmed and injured by sin
inheriting the culture of sin and sin's
damages that are all around us here's
the lesson today simple lesson but hang
on there's a part two
today we do inherit the curse of sin
that is sin's death it's Fallen upon
every one of us we do inherit the
contamination of sin that's sin's
disposition we know good and evil and we
lean into evil often but we can do good
we inherit the corruption of sin that is
sin's depravity it is certainly not just
all around us it is contagious to us and
we do inherit the culture of sin that is
sin's Damages not only are we damaged by
the sins of others we're damaged because
we often follow the example of the sins
of others so we needed someone to die
and to be cursed in our
place to take away our
curse and then to rise from the dead to
prove that he did it that's the reason
he died for our sins but he was as
Romans puts it raised for our
justification his resurrection proves
our
justification that our sin problem has
been taken care of if you don't believe
you have a sin problem you're adol
fman you know better no different
denying any
guilt you have a sin problem I have a
sin
problem in popular
BBC uh television murder mystery series
I have not watched it anybody watch
broad
church I haven't watched a moment of it
I was reading about
it apparently a lovely little Seaside
Town had a child murdered in it in the
story this just make Bel story right
hope so detective Eli Miller was dubious
that anyone in their little town he's
from that town could possibly have
killed a child just doesn't happen in
our
town it is a tight-knit community of
good people we don't have this problem
in our
town
really well the detective inspector Alec
Hardy
said in response to that
anyone's capable of murder given the
right circumstances did you know that
about
you
Miller says most people have moral
compasses
though Hardy comes back moral compasses
break now Timothy Keller some of you
know who he is he just died recently he
he's a theologian he said this about
that fictitional thing he said the
fictitional detective inspector is
telling us exactly what the Bible says
you must not be in denial about your
capacity for evil you will do some
really bad things in your life that will
utterly shock you unless you get a hold
of this particular truth from the Bible
blame shifting is therefore one of the
most dangerous things that you can
do but in our culture we don't hear
that no this is not our biggest problem
I listed those problems before no
this is our problem GK chesterson famous
philosopher Theologian is asked by a
newspaper reporter one
day could you sir could you tell me what
is wrong with our
world it's good
question if you ever get asked that
question maybe you'll remember his
answer what is wrong with our
world he skipped over all the expected
answers he didn't say anything about
corrupt
politicians nothing about ancient
rivalries between Waring Nations that
have bled down on to us he said nothing
about the greed of the rich or the
covetousness of the poor nothing about
that he left aside Street crime or
unjust laws or inadequate
education he didn't say anything about
those he ignored environmental problems
and cities that are overcrowded he
didn't discuss any of that neither did
he mention the structural evils that are
ingrained in our society that do things
to us all didn't say anything about
that he made no mention of evil
institutions with evil
motives when asked by this reporter
what's wrong with our world
chesterson responded with just two
words I
am what's wrong with the world I am
what's wrong with the
world you know after hearing such it's a
bit depressing and Rex thanks a lot Rex
appreciate
it
the good news
is Jesus was wounded for our
transgressions he was bruised for our
iniquities and the chastisement of our
peace fell upon him the good news is is
Jesus was
cursed in our place Deuteronomy
2121 22 and 23 Galatians 3 and verse 13
He bore the curse of sin for us the good
news is Jesus was just and therefore he
died for all of us who were unjust and
since he was just and he died as an
unjust man even though he was not since
he was just and died unjustly those who
were unjust can be
saved and be made
just the good news is that Jesus was
made to be sin that we might be made the
righteousness of God in him 2
Corinthians 5 and verse 21 the good news
is is belief in Jesus
Sav the good news is belief in Jesus and
confessing that you believe in Jesus
Saves the good news is that repenting
from sin as you believe in Jesus Saves
the good news is is that being baptized
for the Forgiveness of your sins saves
the good news is that you are a terrible
sinner who's been saved by the grace of
God that's the good news
saved so how do we save the world oh I
want to save the world I want to make
here's how you save the world get
yourself
saved you want to make a difference in
this world be saved turn yourself from
sin come to the
Lord you just made a big hole in this
wicked world and taken some of the sin
out
it's up to you you need to come come
while we stand while we
sing
