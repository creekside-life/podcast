we need you to be a good example of
attendance my brother and
sister to prove that we can do it don't
do it just for
you do it for
me do it for the one sitting next to you
what you do you don't do just for
you if you do it just for
you it's not worth
much do it for others Jay Adams wrote a
book preaching with purpose and he wrote
in there a little story that I actually
checked out to see it was true it is
true there's a sign at the naras in
what's called The Garden of the Gods
just outside of Colorado Springs where
the road disappears in a narrow crack in
a rock
cliff so narrow that it looks as though
while you're approaching it in a car it
looks as though you couldn't drive a v W
through it but just as you're about to
turn around you spot a sign along the
road that says yes you can millions of
others have and that's all the
encouragement most people need to keep
driving and drive through the crack and
what's called the
Nars the example of others saying that
they've made it
helps the rest of us at least
try you may not believe that you can
come to all the services of the
church you may not think that you can
even be an example of such a
behavior Elanor Roosevelt said something
quite important I think when she said
you must do the thing you think you
cannot do you must do the thing you
think you cannot do so when we say
things like I can't talk to you right
now you sure probably said something
like that before what we really mean is
we are in willing to talk at the expense
of something else that we are doing
right what that means so when we say I
can't go to Sunday school or I can't go
Sunday evenings or I can't can't go
Wednesday evenings or I can't be there
on Sundays what we actually mean is we
are unwilling to have other firm
desires not
done we want to do the firm
desire you must realize that you're an
example everyone sitting here is an
example you're an example to this
community
that you claim membership
in you're an example to the community of
Believers but you're more than that
you're an example to all of Tampa Bay
area in fact lately your example's gone
in
Publications you're an example to wider
audience but not only are you example to
this big audience you're an example to
this little audience everything you do
in this building or around this building
or with each other is an example to one
another as a community of
Believers but that's not the only place
you're an example you're an example in
your
family you say well I'm a widow you've
got other family or you wouldn't be here
you're an example to them well I'm only
a child and a family you're an example
to your mother your father your brother
your
sister well I'm just a grandpa you're an
example to your grandkids your grandma
you're your example you're an example to
your family quit this saying I'm no
example nobody's looking at me
everybody's looking at you quit thinking
that you don't matter you're the most
important example in your little
world and it's not for your
sake it's for theirs in Matthew 5 and:
16 he read just a moment ago you let
your light so shine before men that's a
commandment this is not a
suggestion you're under obligation to be
the best example you can possibly
be in 2 Corinthians 2 verse1 15 we are
to God the favorites of Christ among
those who are being saved your example
is saving Souls how is my example saving
Souls well if nobody were here today and
somebody wanted to find Jesus in here
they wouldn't be saved now would
they it's critical I want to give you
four major reasons we need to be an
example I want to give you four types of
examples you are to
become this is not
imaginary this is real you just may not
have thought about it let's walk through
four examples that we need to be when it
comes to attending the services and all
other works that we're to do for the
Lord we need to be an example we need to
attend all the church services for the
sake of the faith of the community of
Believers to be an example like our
Master
Builders what master builder are we
talking about well one we're talking
about Paul that we should be like 1
Corinthians 3: 10 as a wise master
builder
I have laid the foundation and another
Builds on it but let each take heed how
he builds on it it is the duty of a
master builder to lay a foundation for
other people that means the word I'm
going to use over and over again is it
is your duty to be a master builder that
means it is your duty to be an example
and lay a foundation of faith for
everybody else
that you
know haven't thought about it I
know what master builder like what are
we talking about like Abraham Abraham
was a master builder what would Abraham
do Hebrews 6 11-15 I'll start at verse
12 that you do not become sluggish but
imitate those who through faith and
patience inherit the promise this is
your duty
to imitate those who were before through
faith and patience inherit the promise
who's he talking about verse 13 for when
God made a promise to Abraham because he
could swear by no one greater he swore
by himself saying surely blessing I will
bless you and multiplying I will
multiply you verse 15 and so after he
that is Abraham had patiently endured he
obtained the promise you are to be an
example example to Believers but
particularly an example of faith and
patience that is your
duty to be an example of faith and
patience so that those who come after
you after you're
dead so this is not about
you it is your duty to those who come
after you to leave an example of faith
and patience now you ask yourself
whether attending church has any
connection to
that what Master Builders like Abraham
would not do is also important John
8:39 they said to him Abraham is our
father Jesus said to them if you really
were Abraham's children you would do the
works of
Abraham if you really were the children
of Abraham you would live like Abraham
that's a message to all of us isn't
it so being an example of
works you get that he had Works he did
works are you an example of
works and say yeah yeah I'll I'll help
people the biggest help you make is when
you go to church and other people see it
even in your community when your car
drives out of your neighborhood and all
their cars are lined up around their
houses you're sending a message of an
example of Works what Master Builders do
Ephesians 2:22 says we've built together
for a Dwelling Place of God building up
the dwelling place of God here it
is God dwells in all of you this is the
dwelling place of God on Earth
so you're called to be an
example of God's
presence where God is all the time not
just Sunday
morning Where's God on Sunday
night Where's God on Wednesday night
Where's God on Monday morning when you
go to
work all the time and what Master
Builders do according to 1 Peter 2 and
verse 5 as living Stone are being built
up a spiritual house what do Master
Builders do they build up the spiritual
House of believers they don't tear it
down and run it down behind their
back they don't say ugly things about
the preacher although he might deserve
it because that's not what a master
builder would
do a master builder would want to build
up the spiritual household and he he
wouldn't want to say ah leave it to them
to fix
it so
attend if you would be like a master
builder of the community of Believers
and by the way that's the example you've
been
given so you were given that example but
now it's called upon you to give the
example of being like a master
builder number two we need you attend
all the church services for the sake of
the faith of the community of Believers
to be an example like our
Messiah what the Messiah would do well
John 13:15 says I've given you an
example that you should do as I have
done to you in that text he washed the
feet of the
Believers that's an example of humble
service absolutely what washing the
feet the most menial thing you could do
you should be willing to do it let me
tell you going to church is not the most
menial thing you can
do it's way above
that what the Messiah did can you
imagine him saying I don't care if they
follow me to church or not imagine that
Messiah what the Messiah would think to
do what would he think think to do
Philippians 2 verse 5 let this mind be
in you which was also in Christ Jesus
what was in the mind of Christ Jesus in
the mind of Christ Jesus was to come to
this earth become a human which is not
what he was but to become a human in
that state of being a human to be a
servant to obey and then die a horrible
death not for
himself but for everyone else
do you hear what that's calling you to
do see he's your example and so we need
to be like him to be an example so we're
to be an example of willing humble
service what the Messiah would suffer to
do 1 Peter 2: 21 to this you were called
because Christ also suffered for us not
for him for us leaving us and example
that you should follow his steps so we
should be willing like him to suffer for
the Believers oh when that alarm goes
off on Sunday
morning we're in the middle of the
football game Sunday night I mean the
Super
Bowl Wednesday night I'm just barely
getting here because we I work I I drive
it's 30 minutes in the traffic alone to
get
here an example of suffering not for you
it's got nothing to do with
you it's for
us what the Messiah did do Luke 4 and
verse 16 as his custom was he went in
the synagogue on the Sabbath day and set
up for the read you know what I find
interesting about that is whoever wrote
that knew it was was his
custom don't you find that
interesting he had a
reputation what he did when it was time
for services he was there he attended
with the Believers we are called to be
an example of attending Services how
about that you want to be like your
Messiah you attend you don't want to be
like your Messiah don't
attend it's your
choice what the Messiah and the master
bu did build what did the Master
Builders build what did the Messiah
build Matthew 16:18 I will build
my
church so you may think this
organization don't mean much but he bled
and died for it and I'm telling you
straight up the people sitting next to
you may seem like little people to you
they may not be as big as you they may
not be as as important as you but Jesus
was willing to die for them he sees
everybody in the room as
important and he cares about them and
what you do about your attendance
affects those little people around you
that you look down on that you don't
think are as important as you
are maybe you need to rethink
that so an example of building up his
community is who he was will you be an
example of building up your community
told you this is going to be a hard
lesson attend if you would be like the
Messiah for the sake of the community of
Believers we need to attend all the
church services for the sake of the
faith of the community of Believers to
be an example like our
missionaries now maybe you haven't
realized it but every one of you was
reached by a
missionary if you're a child of God
today a missionary saved
you you weren't saved by yourself you
didn't save
yourself you think you did this by
yourself you're a fool if you think you
did this by yourself you hear me I said
it straight up you're a fool if you
think you did this by
yourself God sent somebody to
you maybe a whole bunch of
somebody's what missionaries would do
for the sake of the J 1 Thessalonians 1
verse one Paul and Silas and Timothy
just
names they happen to mean something to
us cuz they're in the Bible we would
never have known them if they were in
the
Bible but Paul Silas and Timothy to the
Church of the Thessalonians why because
they were missionaries to thessalonica
verse six and you became followers of us
Paul and Silas and Timothy you became
followers of us your missionaries the
guys who came had brought the message to
you as a you became followers of us and
of the Lord having received the word in
much Affliction with joy of the Holy
Spirit verse 7 so that you became
examples to all in Macedonia and a KO
believe we were examples to you and you
became examples to them you see how it
works that's how it works we become
examples because we who receive the
missionaries become the missionaries
so an example of following Mission work
we are to
go but what missionaries would do
according to 2 Thessalonians is equally
interesting it says in verse one Paul
and Silas and Timothy the Church of
thessalonica same words chapter 3 verse
7 for you yourselves know how you ought
to follow
us for we were not disorderly among you
you saw we beh sa
ourselves why cuz it's
critical when you hear of a Preacher
going off the rails and committing
adultery it destroys us
all when you hear of an elder going off
the rails and committing adultery it
destroys us all a little bit
right how you behave is critical first
eight nor did we eat anyone's bread free
of charge but worked with labor and toll
not and day that we might not be a
burden to any of you not because we do
not have authority but to make ourselves
an example of how you should follow
us we
missionaries are being an example so
that you would be an example to
others an example of what an example of
working around the clock not just
working an hour on Sunday
morning Round the Clock day and night
whatever it takes to reach more what
missionaries like Paul would do well
Philippians 3:17 says Brethren join in
following my example and note those who
so walk as you have us for a pattern
what was he a pattern of we had it read
to us earlier we read it all together in
Acts 20 and: 7 the disciples came
together to break bread and Paul
preached to them what's the example 1
Corinthians 4: vers 16 what he taught
one place he taught in all the
congregation 1 Corinthians 11:1 they
were all to be examples so attend and be
an example to the Believers of attending
that's critical an example of the
pattern that's been left you think that
attending church is not the part of the
pattern H Where Have You Been what have
you been
reading you don't realize that what have
you been reading and thinking to think
that some of the Services aren't a part
of the pattern what where were you
reading what were you thinking how would
that be a good example
how what missionary Silas would do acts
15:32 this is New American Standard says
Judas and Silas also being prophets
themselves encouraged and strengthened
the Brethren with a lengthy message I'm
all for lengthy messages but the point
in this text is to encourage and
strengthen they were examples to
encourage and
strengthen do you get it now they were
examples to encourage and strengthen as
a missionary what's your
purpose how can you do that think of
other ways I'm not telling you
attendance is everything I'm telling you
it's some of the
stuff what missionary Timothy would do
in 1 Timothy 4:12 being an example to
the Believers in word and in conduct so
be an example to the Believers how do
you do that in what you say and what you
do and what you say and what you do you
can talk all day long about what you
think but at some point I'm going to
watch what you do
amen be an example of word and conduct
for so attending if you would be like
the missionaries that were trying to
build up the kingdom all around the
world they didn't lay in bed on Sunday
morning
we need to attend all the church
services for the sake of the faith of
the community of Believers to be an
example like our
managers like our
managers what managers well it's very
clear our managers in the New Testament
are our overseers our Bishops and our
elders those are our managers I know
that's true because 1 Timothy 3:5 says
if a man does not know how to manage his
own household how will he take care of
the Church of God it is the duty of our
elders to take care of
us to watch after us and take care of us
that's their duty but if you listen
carefully you're being called to that
it's easy to put that monkey on somebody
else's back isn't it oh yeah they need
to watch after this church yeah while
you sleep through it
is that the way that works so you have
no managerial
responsibility is that the way that
works if if I'm following this correctly
it says if a man does not know how to
manage his own household so I think the
first place you have to be an example is
an example to your own household maybe
I'm missing something there where do you
want your kids to be on Sunday night
where do you want them to be on
Wednesday night where do you want them
to be during Sunday school where do you
want them to be Sunday morning where do
you want them to be show them that's how
you get them there what managers that's
rulers that's overseers that's Bishops
that's Elders what would they do Hebrews
13:7 remember those who rule over you
who have spoken the word of God to you
whose face follow whose Faith follow
follow their faith live a
faith that is worthy of being followed
that is in your speech and in your faith
would someone be a better Christian if
they listen listen to what you say and
they watch what you
did what managers that's rulers
overseers Shepherds Elders would do
Hebrews 13:7 obey those who rule over
you and be submissive for they watch
after your souls now listen to me I do
not believe we go we do have services on
Sunday night and Wednesday night because
the elders say so I've heard that all my
life I don't go to church because of
that I went to church not because I had
some Elder telling me what to do I'm
sorry that's just not the reason not go
to church I would want to go to church
on Wednesday night or Thursday night or
Tuesday night or something during the
week if there were no such thing as
Elders amen
walls so that's not the truth I I love
those guys they're good guys they're not
perfect guys and some ways you know I
mean just like anybody else you get
tired of them
sometimes just like anybody else but
listen to me that's not why we go but
you need to pay attention to what they
do
because they're supposed to watch out
for your soul what does that mean for me
that means it is my responsibility to
watch after your soul your
responsibility to watch about his soul
your responsibility to watch after their
soul and let me tell you what you can't
do is watch somebody you ain't seeing so
when you're not here Wednesday night you
ain't watching nobody's
Soul you want to watch somebody's Soul
you got to be where they
are and if they're not there you go
check on them amen you find out what's
going on that's how you do it that's how
elders are supposed to do it that's how
we're supposed to do it we're all
supposed to be managers this thing isn't
something that you get to just have your
own opinion the church is in a cafeteria
where I pick what I like and I eat that
and leave the rest too many of us act
like that that's not the
church you are under a responsibility to
be like a manager what managers rulers
overseers Bishops Elders would do
Matthew
24:45 who then is a faithful and wise my
servant whom his master made ruler over
his household to give them food in due
season so if you have a family feed them
at the right time I guarantee if you
don't they'll let you know right an
example an example therefore of being
like a manager is of your household you
feed
them you don't just
eat you not you didn't hear me I know
you didn't hear me
your duty isn't just to come and sit and
soak your duty is to
feed
others yeah feed yourself absolutely
We're In Worship we're all feeding amen
the songs the the words that spoken the
scripture the read we're all feeding yes
amen amen but it comes your turn to do
some
feeding you got to feed your kids
right
right there a point in which we need you
to be a feeder not a
eater what managers rulers overseers
Bishops Elders would do 1 Peter 5: 1-5
the elders who are among you I exhort I
who am a fellow Elder and a witness of
the sufferings of Christ this is Peter
talking and also a partaker of the glory
that would be revealed verse two
Shepherd the flock what do you do with
sheep you watch them protect them you
make sure they get fed Shepherd the
flock of God which is among you when do
you do that all the time serving as an
overseer not by compulsion but willingly
not for dishonest game but eagerly nor
as being Lords over those entrusted you
you're not a boss but being examples to
the flock example that word just keeps
repeating have you heard it imitate be
an example imitate be an example imitate
so be an example to the flock like a
bunch of shepherds who would watch after
the Sheep around you if you're really
hearing
that Shepherd serve as an
example so
attending if you would be like the
managers of the community of Believers
if you're a true manager you couldn't
miss a
service so the Soul's community of
Believers we need to attend all church
services for the sake of the faith of
the community of belie not for me but
for
them be an example like if we were the
master builder be an example as if we
were the Messiah be an example as if we
were the missionary everybody's depended
upon being example as if we were the
managers that were managing the whole
church your example should matter to you
because you should care about
us do you
care do you do you care if we go to
heaven or you don't care if we go to
hell John Moore in 1988
wrote we're pilgrims on the Journey of
the narrow
road and those who've gone before us
line the way cheering on the faithful
encouraging the weary their lives a
stirring testament to God's sustaining
Grace surrounded by so great a cloud of
witnesses let us run the race not only
for the pride
eyes but as those who gone before us let
us leave to those behind us the heritage
of
faithfulness passed on through Godly
lives oh may all who come behind us Find
Us
Faithful May the fire of our devotion
light their way may the
footprints that we
leave lead them to believe believe and
the lives we live Inspire them to obey
oh may all who come behind us Find Us
Faithful after all our hopes and dreams
have come and
gone and our children sift through all
we've left
behind May the clues that they discover
and the memories they uncover become the
light that leads them to the road we
each must find oh may all who come
behind us Find Us Faithful May the fire
of our devotion light their way may the
footprints that we leave lead them to
believe and the lives we live Inspire
them to obey oh may all who come behind
as find as faithful 60 years ago
in my life 60 years ago in my life I was
asked to say a poem at a PTA
meeting scared me to death I'd never
been in front of people I was terrified
s years old
terrified and but at the time as crazy
as it sounds my dad was the PTA
president and he made it happen I I
wasn't appreciative at at all and I was
expected to say a poem in front of the
whole so I walked out there in the
middle and probably got it wrong but
it was a poem by John McCrae most of you
probably know it it's called in Flanders
Field and it speaks so well to what I'm
talking about today it says in Flanders
Field the poppies blow between the
crosses you know what's in Flanders
Field right the crosses where they took
Europe in Flanders fille where the
poppies blow between the crosses row on
row that Mark our
place and in the Sky the Lark still
bravely singing fly scarce heard amid
the guns
below we are the
dead short days
ago we
lived felt Dawn saw Sunset glow
loved and were loved but now we
li Flanders
Field take up our quarrel with the
foe to you from failing hands we
throw the torch be yours to hold it high
and if you break faith in us who die we
shall not sleep though poppies grow in
Flanders Field how does the first
century
Christian see us
how do our brothers who were in an arena
eaten by lions see
us how do they look at the examples
we're leaving in a world that doesn't
want you to even go to church ever again
and we slip away and look for reasons to
not
come how do they see
us we're at War war with satanic
forces we need your
example be
here be
here be here we need
you follow the examples
attend attend you make out like that's
the most important thing in the world I
know better I got blah blah blah blah
blah blah yeah I just don't like your
attitude at
all and that disturbs me something awful
that I would even have to have a sermon
on attending that I've had to do five
and you might probably think I've
enjoyed this I find this
repulsive I don't think there should be
a sermon on this
subject I don't believe there should
ever be a baptized believer that needs
to ask the question should I
go what in the world are we raising what
were you baptized in
alcohol was it the real thing or
not I told you I don't want this sermon
I don't like this sermon I don't like
preaching sermons like this I wish I was
somewhere else right this
moment but I am upset it's you and I
know who you're listening I know those
of you who don't come you think I don't
know I know your example which drags me
down and drags the rest of us down and
you think nothing of it and it disgusts
me that we have to have a lesson on this
subject I don't have anything to say
