in thanksfulness, Father. And may this
lesson help us along that path. It's in
Jesus name we pray. Amen.
This lesson is very simple,
but it's very difficult. And the reason
I say that is because
there are a lot of angry people. And you
may be one of them. You may be unhappy
about the way your life is turning out.
And you may not be admitting it to
anyone, but you may be slightly
irritated and unhappy
and it's not going the way you want.
If that's your case, this lesson is
going to come hard.
But it is a lesson we all need and I
hope it's a blessing to you. Not
everyone is thankful, nor does everyone
express gratitude.
Ralph Waldo Emerson said this. If the
stars only came out once every thousand
years,
no one would sleep that night. Of
course, the world would become religious
overnight. We would be ecstatic, delir
del delirious, made rapturous by the
glory of God. Instead, the stars come
out every night and we watch television
instead.
We've seen the stars so often, we don't
bother to look at them anymore, do we?
And yet, they're the most magnificent
things that we probably will ever see.
We've grown accustomed to our blessings.
There are many reasons for that. Some
are pagan people
and they're accustomed to their beliefs.
And so Romans 1:21, they did not glorify
God, nor were they thankful. Some are
prosperous people and they're so
accustomed to the stars and their
blessings, they don't think about it
anymore.
There are entitled people
who think they inherently deserve not
just what they're getting but more. And
they're pretty much irritated about it.
There are atheists who don't know what
to do at Thanksgiving except to thank
other people because they don't believe
in God. So they don't really think they
should thank God.
There are bad people.
By that I mean Luke 6 says the Most High
is kind to the unthankful and the evil.
So unthankful people tend to be more
evil.
And there just some people that aren't
thankful for anything.
There are egotistical people
that are proud of themselves, love
themselves, focus only on themselves.
Sometimes they don't think of anybody
else but themselves.
Second Timothy 3 says they're lovers of
themselves, lovers of money, boasters,
proud blasphemers, disobedient to
parents, and unthankful.
I hope that's not you.
Then there are God's people. Well, now
naturally God's people, you know, are
grateful. Not so much.
I know that might come as an offense to
you, but religious people aren't that
thankful as much as you might think.
Listen to this. In Luke chapter 17, he
entered a certain village there, met him
10 men who were lepers who stood a far
off. So almost all of these guys were
people of Israel. They're the people of
God. This is a city in Israel. Verse 13.
And they lifted up their voices and
said, "Jesus, master, have mercy on us."
So when he saw them, he said them, "Go
show yourselves to the priests." So
obviously they believe what he believes.
They're going to the priests. They're
religious people. And so it was that as
they went, they were cleansed.
And one of them, one of 10, one of them,
when he saw that he was healed, returned
and with a loud voice glorified God and
fell down on his face at his feet,
giving him thanks. And he was a
Samaritan, not an Israelite.
So Jesus answered and said, "Were there
not 10 cleansed? But were the nine? Were
there not any found who returned to give
glory to God except this foreigner?
So, just because you're religious and
you even attend church doesn't mean
you're thankful. Isn't that strange?
Stranger still, what I've run into is it
almost seems like, and I'm not saying
this is true because there's no way I
could prove this, but it almost seems
like those with less to be thankful for
are more thankful. Have you noticed
that? Listen to Irma Bombck. I miss her.
Y'all remember Irma? She passed away in
96. She was great. She was funny. 96 is
when she passed away. She said an
estimated 1.5 million people are living
today after bouts with breast cancer.
That was back then. You got to remember
this is back before 96 cuz she passed
away in 96 I believe from that. She said
went on to say, "Every time I forget to
feel grateful to be among those that
survive,
I hear the voice of an eight-year-old
named Christina, who had cancer of the
nervous system."
When asked what she wanted for her
birthday, she thought long and hard and
finally said this.
"I don't know.
I have two sticker books and a Cabbage
Patch doll.
I have everything that
I have everything.
You know what that kid was right?
Helen Keller passed away in 1968.
She had lost her sight and her hearing
at 19 months old. So really she had no
memory to any degree of hearing or
seeing.
She wrote the famous preacher Philip
Brooks one time and when she was still
just a child and listen as a child she
wrote these words. It fills my heart
with joy to know that God loves me so
much, that he wishes me to live always,
and that he gives me everything that
makes me happy, loving friends, a
precious little sister, sweet flowers,
and the warm sunshine. And best of all,
a mind that can think and enjoy, and a
heart that can love and sympathize.
Everybody can have those things.
I want to give you seven things quickly
and I'm not going to take too long here.
We're going to move through this qu
quickly. But I I think you need to
change.
I think I need to change.
I think we need to quit having
Thanksgiving days
and start having thanksgiving.
that it's always that way.
Number one,
being thankful
is the path to thanksgiving. It says in
Psalm 104, "Enter into his gates with
thanksgiving and into his courts with
praise. Be thankful." That means all the
time. Be thankful to him and bless his
name. and let the peace of God rule in
your heart to which also you were called
in one body and be thankful. So what
he's suggesting is is that we become
thankful people.
The second truth
being thankful every day
is the path to thanksgiving. Psalm
145:2, every day I will bless you and I
will praise your name forever and ever.
Every day.
So we need to learn the path to being
thankful but being thankful every single
day. Even the bad days, even the bad
days.
Number three, being thankful
always
is the path to thanksgiving and
thanksgiving. Colossians 1 verse three,
we give thanks to God and the father of
our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always
for you. 1 Thessalonians 1:2, we give
thanks to God always for you all, making
mention of you in our prayer. 2
Thessalonians 2:13, but we are bound to
give thanks to God always
for you, brethren, beloved by the Lord,
because God from the beginning chose you
for salvation through sanctification by
the spirit and belief in the truth. So
if you can't think of anything else, if
you're going to be thankful always,
think of us
and be thankful for your brethren
always.
But if we're going to be involved in
thanksgiving,
we need next
to we learn that we need to be being
thankful in everything.
Well, that just sounds extreme.
First Thessalonians 5:18, in everything
give thanks, for this is the will of God
in Christ Jesus for you.
Well, that's just in every situation,
find something. Well, that's right. That
is what that means. So, in every
situation, be grateful for something.
Like a moment ago, grateful we had a
team of people that could stand up,
right, and do something
in everything. But some might be
thinking, "This sounds a bit extreme,
though. Sounds like you have some
cognitive dissonance going on in your
head if you're like this. But listen to
me. I'm just going to keep reading what
the Bible says. Okay. The next thing is
being thankful. That's right. Notice
what it says for all things. Well,
that's extreme. Well, listen to what it
says. Ephesians 5:20. I didn't write
these words. Giving thanks always for
all things to God the Father in the name
of our Lord Jesus Christ. How could that
ever be? I Have you ever read Romans
8:28 that all things work together for
good to those who are called according
to So, but I don't see it. Well, that's
right. That's why it takes faith and a
very thankful heart to see a way to be
thankful for all things. Thinking
somehow God's doing something good even
there. Otherwise, how could you be
thankful for all things? Sounds extreme
to me, Rex.
Yeah, it does to me too until you start
doing it.
The next one,
being thankful without ceasing. Without
ceasing.
Listen to what First Thessalonians 2:13
says. For this reason, we also thank God
without ceasing. Because when you
received the word of God, which you
heard from us, you welcomed it, not as
the word of men, but as it is in truth,
the word of God, which also effectively
worked in you who believe. Did you
notice he gave a reason for the without
ceasing? Because otherwise it might
sound extreme, but it's not extreme.
Listen to Romans 1:9. For God is my
witness, whom I serve with my spirit,
the gospel of his son, that without
ceasing, I make mention of you always in
my prayers. I'm not only thankful for my
brethren and what God's done through
them and for me, but I am thankful to be
able to pray without ceasing. 1
Thessalonians 5:17, praying without
ceasing.
It sounds extreme,
but God calling us not to a Thanksgiving
day, but to thanksgiving,
a different way of thinking every day,
all day in every situation, for all
things. That's different. Finally,
listen to this one. Being thankful
forever is the pathway to thanksgiving.
Psalm 30:12, he read it a moment ago. To
the end that my glory, that is when I
receive or I received up into glory to
then that my glory may sing praises to
you and not be silent. I'm looking
forward to it. Aren't you? To the day
we're in heaven together and in my
glorious state, I will sing praises to
him there. You know what? I could be
wrong, but I think as much as you enjoy
singing here and praising God here,
that's going to give me the juice. I'm
going to enjoy it even more. Don't you
think you'll enjoy it just a little?
We'll sing in heaven a new song because
we will see it totally different, won't
we? We'll see it so much more wonderful.
Let me keep reading.
to the end that my glory may sing praise
to you and not be silent. Oh Lord my
God, I will give thanks to you forever.
Psalm 78. I've heard people say, "Won't
that be boring? It isn't boring here.
Why would it be boring there?"
Psalm 79:13. So we, your people and
sheep of your pasture will give you
thanks forever. Now listen, he's not
talking about there now. He's talking
about here now. The forever of here
because he goes on to say, "We will show
forth your praise to all generations."
So yes, we're going to praise God and
thank him forever there, but forever
here than forever here. So think about
this. Look at the things he's saying
that we're to do. This doesn't sound
like Thanksgiving Day, does it?
This sounds like a different type of
people that's different from the world
around us. That we live in thanksgiving.
That we are thankful people. We're
thankful and we're thankful every day.
We're thankful always. We're thankful in
everything. We're thankful for
everything. We're thankful without
ceasing. And we're thankful forever.
That's a different path.
Now, here's the deal.
for a lot of people and I've you can
read it out there. So if you think I'm
fixing to make this up, I want you to
know that there is an anti what I've
just taught.
There is a disagreement with everything
I've just taught you. Which by the way,
I didn't teach you anything, did I? We
read all of that, didn't I? Didn't we
read that? Was that from Rex Dutton? Did
Rex Dutton invent any of that? No. It's
in your Bible, right? Amen. every word
of it. You saw it. You read it yourself.
I didn't say any of that. Here's the
truth. Our culture believes that kind of
thinking is toxic.
They talk about it. They call it toxic
gratitude.
They would say, "Wretch, you're carrying
being thankful way too far. You're
minimizing my needs. You're making me
feel obligated to be grateful. You're
ignoring my genuine feelings of pain and
anger and suffering and making me feel
unworthy. And you're trying to make me
feel satisfied with settling for less
than what I really deserve.
You think I'm making that up. You know
that's not made up, right? You know
that's how a lot of people think. Some
of them think that way sitting here
right now.
Thanksgiving is a gratitude so profound
that if you can catch this spirit
it won't make sense to you even
it won't make sense to the people around
you. How can you be so cheerful? How can
you be so happy? How can you look for
something fun? John, I'm telling John
feels bad. He's been here in church. He
felt bad many, many times. And he's
telling me a joke.
Matthew Henry,
he was a famous Bible expositor.
One time he was accosted by thieves
and he was robbed, but he wasn't hurt.
But he wrote in his diary that night
after he'd been robbed. Here's what
Matthew Henry wrote in his diary.
Let me be thankful
first
because I was never robbed before. You
ever been robbed? I've been robbed a few
times. You ever been robbed? It's not
funny.
It's not funny because I was never
robbed before. He said, "That's great."
Second, he goes on, "Because although
they took my purse, all my money, they
did not take my life." Amen to that. You
ever been robbed?
Third, because all they although they
took my all, it's all my money. It was
not that much.
Kind of glad they didn't get that much.
And then fourth, because it was I who
was robbed and not I that roted.
Thanksgiving is an obsession.
It's not an event.
It's an obsession.
You end up wanting to be thankful and
more thankful and more thankful and more
thankful.
Dan Vickers, who was an Oregon police
officer,
was on his way to California for the
Harley-Davidson convention,
and there was some road construction
ahead of him, and they didn't see it
soon enough. And it suddenly appeared
upon them, he and his group of
motorcycle enthusiasts that were driving
along, and they had to stop suddenly.
Now, if you know anything about
motorcycles, they can't stop quite as
quick sometimes as cars. And so, he had
to lay his motorcycle down to keep from
hitting people. And he was at a high
speed. As a result, he was left with a
broken shoulder, broken ribs, and a
collapsed lung
laying there in the road.
A passerby stopped to aid
Vickers.
She told him her name, Sally.
And she told him she was a registered
nurse. Almost feels like we were just
there, doesn't it?
Sally, registered nurse.
And she cradled him
in his pain and assured him, "Help's on
the way. Helps on the way, Don."
When the paramedics arrive,
Vickers was airlifted. He was in such
bad shape to the hospital where he spent
10 days.
And then after that was over with,
he wanted to thank Sally.
Here's what he said. When I woke up on
the pavement, he said, "She was holding
my head. She very calmly talked to me
and calmed me. Afterward, she just
walked off.
It's important to me to find her and to
thank her." Vicer's wife said her
husband has become obsessed,
almost to the point of an a real
obsession, to thank Sally. In a
newspaper article in the Oregonian in
98, Vickers had asked that anyone who
knew who Sally was, nobody had ever come
forward to contact him.
To this day, as far as we could tell,
there's never been another report. She
ne he never found Sally. If Sally's out
there right now, if you're the Sally, he
wanted to thank you.
You see, there are a lot of Sally's out
there, and Sally needs to be thanked. We
need to have a spirit of an obsession.
When someone does something kind to us
that we won't let them go past without
thanking them. Amen. We need to be
grateful all the time for the smallest
thing, a cup of cold water given in the
name of a disciple. We need to be
thankful. We need to be thankful. But
most of all, here you're coming up on
Thanksgiving Day and all the family's
getting around. Of course, be thankful
that day. But folks, there's so many
things to be grateful for every day, all
the time. If you eat a meal and you
don't say a prayer over your food, what
what if if you get given something at
Christmas and you're not grateful and
you don't tell them thank you. If you
get given anything and you're not how in
the world could we of all people are you
hearing be all people of all people on
the earth we should be living lives of
thanksgiving. Amen.
So, if you're here today and you never
given your life to the Lord, let me tell
you what you are. You're ungrateful.
You're ungrateful.
Jesus built this world for the father,
gave you life as a human being, and then
died for your soul.
And you can't give your life back to
him. You're ungrateful. But you can
change that. and you could start
thanksgiving.
Here's a good opportunity. If you're not
right with the Lord, if you haven't
heard the gospel, believed it, repented
of your sins, confessed the name of
Christ, we'll help you through that. But
if you know you should have done it, and
you just haven't done it, and you never
been baptized, we'll help you through
that.
Stop being ungrateful
and start having some thanksgiving in
your life. You need to come, come while
we stand and while we sing.
