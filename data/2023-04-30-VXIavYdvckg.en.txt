True Fellowship involves touching each
other it's not really a fellowship
without a touch the Lord declares that
he's the
Potter the Potter must touch the
clay there is no vessel without a
touch you don't become the people that
God wants you to be without him touching
you the Potter touches the clay in
Galatians 2 and ver9 when James sephus
and John who seem to be pillars
perceived the grace that had been given
to me they gave me and Barnabas the
right hand of
Fellowship God intends for us to touch
each other
literally Fellowship is not something
where we just say
hi you need to at least knuckle bump
people but he meant us to touch
the
hug even to kiss the holy kiss is
encouraged through the scriptures not
just any kind of kiss but a holy Kiss by
the way having worked in Africa I
promise you it's not as attractive as it
sounds when you kiss everybody in the
building you really feel like you maybe
need to wash your mouth
but he encourages a fellowship amen a
physical one
Sarah a friend of a blogger no I don't
know who Sarah is but she speaks to me
and she may speak to you she's a blogger
about what happened during
covid-19 listen to her words I haven't
touched another human being in seven
weeks y'all remember
that I haven't touched another human
being in seven weeks I never thought I'd
miss something as simple as a handshake
from a stranger even brushing past
people to get off the bus sounds like a
luxury at this point do you remember
touching is
important and the Lord intends to touch
you as the Potter if you let
him unless you just want to be a lump of
clay off by
yourself there's touching that touches
and then there's touching that doesn't
touch that's true whether we're talking
about emotional
touching some people touch others
emotionally without touching anybody
there's physical Touch without touching
and there's spiritual touching without
touching in Mark 5: 28 again let me just
remind you if only I may touch his
clothes she said to herself I shall be
made well in verse
31
the disciples after hearing him say
somebody touched me said the multitude
is thronging you that's they're
wallowing all over you they're thronging
you and you say who touched me it's a
strange idea but you can be in a crowd
and constantly be bumping into people
even bumping into Jesus bumping into
others without touching a single person
there without anyone else touching you
it seems bizarre when you think about it
many look as if they're touching Jesus
and Jesus is touching them without
touching Jesus and without Jesus
touching
them you can attend a funeral and be
untouched you can attend
church and be
untouched you can hear a verse of
scripture and be untouched you can hear
a sermon and be untouched you can hear a
hymn sing A Hymn and be untouched you
can hear a prayer and be untouched you
can see a baptism and be untouched you
can take
communion and be untouched you can even
shake a hand and be
untouched I just look at about three
angles to look at this this passage and
I think it may give you some
Enlightenment number next if you'll turn
the thank you back one thank you no two
back forward one there we
go
success number one there is touching
without touching the hym of his
precepts you see a lot of people think
even in that day all they wanted to do
is touch him a lot of people touch
Jesus but they weren't touching the hym
of his
precepts in Mark 5 if you look just down
to verse 28 you'll notice this statement
for she said if only I may touch his
clothes I shall be made well well
actually she said something slightly
different than the way Mark records it
and in Mark 9 and verse 20 it makes it
clear what was really going on when
people wanted to touch them it says and
suddenly a woman who had a flow of blood
for I mean Matthew 9 sorry is the
parallel passage and suddenly a woman
who had a flow of blood for 12 years
came from behind and this is what
Matthew says and touched the hymn of His
Garment now you and I are not Jewish or
at least most of us aren't and so as a
result you may not be aware of the toite
and so you don't know of the prayer Shaw
that true Jews wear all the time they
wear it only their clothing all the time
it's underneath and that has four
corners and on each corner there is a
tassel literally a tassel like you've
seen on curtains and the knots that make
up that tassel are
613 knots specifically 613
knots it's a blue tassel with a blue
thread and the significance of that Hem
of that tassel is is it represents the
613 laws in the Old Testament you
probably thought there were 10 but the
Jews went around and they literally
counted every time God told him to do
something and there were
613 of those in the Old Testament that's
why there's 613 knots and those
represent everything that God had ever
told him to do there's a many a person
who's touched the Lord that didn't touch
anything about what he was commanding
them to do and Matthew chapter
14:36 it says and he begged him that
they might only touch the Hemm of His
Garment and as many as touch were made
perfectly well they made a connection
with the Commandments the precepts of
God have you in Mark chapter 6 and verse
56 it says whenever he entered Villages
cities or in the country they laid the
sick in the market places and begged him
that they might just touch the hymn of
His Garment they just
that's the thing that they wore on their
head and they enlarg the borders of
their garment so I mean you could make
one thread you could make a a lot of
thread down there and make it look
really big that's not what he wanted but
here's the thing how many people want to
touch Jesus him to be healed but don't
want anything to do with his precepts
that tell you how you ought to live your
life number
next
back
one there is touching without touching
the hymn of his
Praises do you realize that uh some
people praise without
praising oh yeah the greatest hymns by
the way are private Praises you see when
you're really praising God you're in
your own little world at church you do
know that right it's not about this as
much as it's about what's going on in
here here you see you worship him with
your heart Brethren you don't worship
him with the group the group is
essential to encourage that that's what
that's for we need that encouragement
but there's something that happens
inside or nothing happens inside and
there's no worship happening with
you here's the thing that you need to
see in this story in Mark chapter 5 I'm
not going to read verses 29 33 40 43
I'll just read verses 42 and 43 you can
read this story over and over again I'm
trying to keep it limited here they they
were overcome with great amazement after
he basically did this verse 43 but he
commanded them strictly that no one
should know it why because True Praise
is a private thing see real worship is
private we do it together but it's
private because something's going on and
if it's happening in all it's happening
in your heart or it's not happening at
all how me you make a beautiful if we
all do that we all come here and make
beautiful sound together but none of us
were in our heart no worship even
happened here
today isn't that
interesting you
can touch his hymn
without touching his praises and Mark
Matthew 8: 2-4 I'll just focus a little
bit here it was a left
Who Came To Worship Him fell down at his
feet in verse three he asked if he'd
cleanse him immediately his leprosy was
cleansed verse four says and Jesus said
to him see that you tell no one go your
way and show yourself to the priests
offer the gift of Moses why what's the
significance here's the deal it wasn't
just that he didn't want right then to
blow this thing up he did that as well
but the thing is is that each Miracle is
private each blessing is personal every
story out there and we all have one is
private and personal and if you combine
that with what we're doing here suddenly
worship goes boom you don't and you walk
out of here
untouched in Matthew
chapter um now let me go to Luke Luke 5:
12-16 I'll just focus in on verse 13
then he put out his hand this is the
leper again just told a different way
and touched him now the touch a leper
was inappropriate but he did saying I am
willing be clean and immediately his
lepy left him in verse 14 and he charged
him tell no one this is
yours this is your
blessing you know and there's some
blessings that happen in your life if
you're really honest that nobody can
know about they'll never understand
it you've been through some things God's
rescued you and you could tell it and it
wouldn't have the significance it has
within you because you know in luk um
Mark chapter 7 look at verses 32 through
37 but again I'm just focusing really on
verses 35 beginning immediately his ears
were open and because I mean he couldn't
speak and he couldn't hear it says
immediately his ears were opened and uh
the impediment of his tongue was loosed
and he spoke plainly verse 36 then he
commanded them that they should tell no
one but the more he commanded them the
more widely they proclaimed it there's
something you see when you really know
you've been blessed you got to say
something you got to praise
him you got to verse 37 and they were
astonished beyond measure saying he has
done all things
well was it for
crimes that I have done
that he groaned upon the tree oh yes
crimes you see when you break the law of
God you might that's a criminal against
God yes I am a
criminal if you could accept it you are
too but I definitely know I am and so
therefore I know that the cross
represents
amazing
pity Grace that I have no knowledge
of and love that's beyond anything I've
ever
seen that makes me want to praise
God you see many want to touch jesus'
hymns Come and sing beautiful things and
focus on oh it must sound good we got to
have the best song leader we got to
sound good some people want us to have
instruments because it's got to sound
good or we got to have a group up here
that sings cuz it's got to sound good
because if it doesn't sound good it's
not real worship let me tell you all of
that is ridiculous and wrong because the
only thing that really happens is when
the
hymns begin to touch
you you can touch
him without touching his
praises and when that happens here's
what
happens your heart is broken here in
this building without paying any
attention to anybody around you
you become
tearful he said well I hav been tearful
in years in worship you know some of you
watch Ted lasso and cry but you come
here and you never cry in church you
never filled with
joy you'll laugh out there and have fun
but you can't do it you can't have a
motion
here well it's sometimes just bad jokes
but third ly the last one finally go to
that one we've been wanting to go to
that's the one there's touching without
touching the hym of his passions do you
really know what his passions
are in Mark 5 this is how it begins
verse 34 and he said to her daughter
your fa daughter I love that he ain't
old enough to be his her her
daddy he's a young man he he's 30 30
something years old there and he's
talking to a woman older than him she's
had a disease longer than he's been
doing any Ministry 12 years she's a good
bit older than him she's got to be
probably 40 years
old
daughter your faith has made you well go
in peace did did he
care verse 36 and as soon as Jesus heard
the word that was spoken he said to the
ruler of the synagogue because they told
him don't don't worry this is the same
story and the same thing it's just the
the ruler of synagogue your son's your
child's your daughter sorry not your son
your daughter is already dead said don't
bother him she's dead verse 36 and as
soon as Jesus heard the word that was
spoken basically turns to the ruler of
the synagogue and listen to what he says
to a father who's just heard his child's
dead don't be
afraid
don't you just love that don't be
afraid only
believe drop down with me to verse
41 and he took the child by the hand
wasen afraid to touch the
kid took the child by the hand and said
to her I'm going just do the
English little
girl arise get
up she
did
now there are those who believe
theologically they're wrong but they
believe theologically that God doesn't
care whether you're healed he only did
that so that you'd believe his word and
that healing is not significant to
God that's so
wrong it's just not true number one
because it it implies something about
God that's actually quite
hateful Luke
4:18 he sent me to
Hill why he could have done anything oh
he just turned water into wine all day
long that would convince a lot of people
especially who wanted to get drunk that
would convince them
right he could have walked on water all
day long he could have sto caused storms
to stop all day long he could have done
all those kind of things but he chose to
heal why CU actually God has no desire
you you may believe he does God has no
desire that you
suffer
none those are lessons for us we need
but he doesn't want it he it's like you
want to spank your kid I know they've
been naughty I just want to spank him
all day long I'd love to spank my kids
again I wish my kids were small Heath
come on down there let me just spank you
one more
time
no don't be mistaken about God has no
desire for you to be sick
he would prefer you to be well he wants
to heal
you that's a mistaken Concept in Luke 6:
6- 11 I I just read verse
10 and when he had looked around at them
all he said stretch out your hand it's
man with a Wither hand in the synagogue
well that doesn't really give you the
full extent of it he's looking at them
and when they did and he was healed
verse 11 says and they were filled with
rage cuz they were looking for something
that Jesus would do wrong I mean he
would dare heal somebody on the Sabbath
day how could he possibly do that and so
they were watching him like a hawk you
know he could have
waited he could have called him the day
before you think he didn't know who he
was the day before he could have caught
him on
Friday he'd catch him on Monday I mean
whatever he catch him Wednesday he catch
him anytime he
wants but he did do that he's right here
so he healed him and it made him mad in
Mark 3 it puts it this way Mark chapter
3 let me read kind of that whole thing
it says a man was there who had a
withered hand so they watched him
closely whether he would heal him on the
Sabbath so that they might accuse him so
that was their whole motivation they
were jealous of him they want him gone
he's a rabbi that's getting too much
attention it's like today some of you
are jealous of other people don't be so
jealous it just ends up destroying you
it doesn't destroy D them verse three
and he said to the man step forward
verse four then he said is it lawful on
the Sabbath to do good or to do evil to
save life or to kill but they kept
silent they didn't want any they didn't
want to answer you catch people who
don't want to answer that's an answer I
Promise You Verse five and when he had
looked around at them with anger being
grieved at the hardness of their hearts
he said stretch out your hand then it
was
What's significant about that is verse 6
says they went out and plotted with the
herodians how they might kill him see he
knew he knew healing on the Sabbath day
would get him
killed did it anyway that's how much he
loves you he's willing to go there but
that's how much he wanted to heal that
person that's just a withered hand
that's just a withered hand folks so
many want to touch Jesus himself oh I've
got Jesus in my heart oh I so want Jesus
and here's what they don't want they
don't want his
passions what would his passion be yeah
he wants them all saved absolutely
that's his passion he died for
that but the people who are sick and
hurting he felt passionately for them do
you is it only your buddies you ever
care about or do you care about the
people who are suffering
do you have his passions so if you have
the passionate desires of Jesus then
he's touched you if you don't they're
hurting people around you and I don't
want it so basically Jesus a touched you
yet you just think he has until you
start caring about people who are worse
off than you you ain't got his
passions touching without touching next
that turn all right we'll get to there
in a second basically the lesson is the
hym of his precepts the hym of his
praises and the hym of his
passions many of you don't know
this you know we live in a bubble in
America we think the only thing that's
going on is what's happening in America
have you ever noticed that so it's
amazing to me the people who think they
know so much about the world they don't
know anything about the world because
they barely listen to the news in their
own country and they don't know anything
about America and they don't know
anything about the rest of the world
it's it's actually quite amazing name
the 168
countries actually they're 180 something
name them I know one boy here that could
but we'll get to that another day over
160
million almost 280 million because
nobody can count them but at least 160
probably at least 200 million maybe 280
million people in India are treated like
their
animals right now now today not Once
Upon a Time way back in the long ago
they are treated
subhuman they are called deluts it's
spelled D A L I TS but it's pronounced
Luts they're tainted by their birth
they're the lowest case system in
India and you only think you know about
Prejudice listen to the these news items
recently dut's boy beaten to death for
plucking flowers how dare
he dut tortured by cops for three
days probably deserved it dut which
paraded n in
Bahar dut killed in lockup a
CaRu seven deluts burned alive in a case
Clash five duts lynched at
hariana dut woman gang raped and paraded
naked before the
crowds the police egged on a mob to
Lynch theuts deluts are not allowed to
drink from the same Wells attend the
same temples wear shoes in the presence
of any upper cast or drink from the same
cup in the tea stall
they're
called
Untouchables you know it's crazy but
there are people who are not physically
like
that but live an Untouchable
life isn't that
bizarre Jesus was always willing to
Humble himself and touch a leper an
Untouchable if we just let him
there's the poem by Myra Brooks welz
that says much about what I'm trying to
get across here it was battered and
scarred and the auctioneer thought it
was scarcely worth his while to waste
much time on the Old Violin but held it
up with a smile what am I bidding good
folks he cried he'll start the bidding
for me a dollar a dollar then two only
two $2 and who'll make it three $3 once
$3 twice going for three but no from the
far back a gray-haired man came forward
and picked up the bow then wiping the
dust from the Old Violin and tightening
the loose strings he played a Melody
pure and sweet a caroling Angel
sings the music ceased and the
auctioneer with a voice that was quiet
and low said what am I bid for the old
violan and he held it up with a
bow
$1,000 well he'll make it too
$2,000 and he'll make it three 3,000
once 3,000 twice and going and gone said
he the people cheered but some of them
cried we don't quite understand what
changed its worth and Swift came the
reply it was the touch the Master's Hand
and many a man with life out of tuned
and battered and scarred with sin his
auction cheat to the thoughtless crowd
which like the violent a mess a pottage
a glass of wine a game and he travels on
he's going once and he's going twice
he's going and almost gone but the
master comes and the foolish crowd never
can quite understand the worth of a soul
and the change that's wrought by the
touch of the Master's
Hand you can bump into his hymn on his
clothes and bump into his hymns that we
sing you can bump into
him and still not be
touched until you want his
precepts until you really seek to praise
him until you have his
passions now there might be someone here
that's never known any of this and they
may to need to give their life to the
Lord and they might not understand what
I'm saying you need to take baby steps
do what you can right now and that is
repent of your sins confess the name of
Christ and be baptized and we'll help
you along that pathway and much of this
may be Beyond you but some of you have
been here for the count of who will pay
1,000 who will pay two for a little
while and Jesus still hadn't touched
you it's not going to be
comfortable it will change
everything touch us Lord come while we
stand and while we sing
