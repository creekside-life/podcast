I want to put a statement on the screen
and just think about whether you would
agree with this statement here it
is
repentance is required of God's
people repentance is required of God's
people do you agree with that
statement yeah I I think so I think we
should in fact in an audience like this
I would trust trust that that statement
doesn't need much support although if
you are curious about it one passage out
of a plethora that we could give is a
verse that's commonly recited in our
circles acts 238 repent and be baptized
for the Forgiveness of your
sins but while this statement is one
that we would give a hearty Amen to in
our assembly here here's my next
question for
you do you evade repentance when it's
required of you
do you evade
repentance when it's required of
you in other words if we
recognize that repentance is a
requirement of God's people then when
we're confronted with our sin why is it
that sometimes we will pull all sorts of
tactics to evade a humble confession and
to act as if repentance is not required
in this case from
me there's many answers that we could
give to that probably the easiest one is
pride which is maybe the umbrella reason
under which all else would follow but
what I want to do tonight is if
repentance is
required from us to be God's
people then we would do well to examine
some of the tactics that we some times
use to evade repentance so that we can
understand what those are and avoid them
in our
life and then on the other
hand we would do well to look at an
example of someone who
demonstrates true repentance so that we
know what that looks like and we can
then act accordingly to that positive
model and so hence our lesson tonight an
evasion and demonstration of
repentance a person in scripture who
illustrates several of the tactics that
we sometimes use to evade
repentance is King
Saul and so we're going to look at this
narrative in 1st Samuel
15 let's read a portion of it first here
so in 1 Samuel 15 would you read with me
the first three verses and then we're
going to skip down to verse 7
1st Samuel
15 first three verses and then skip down
to verse
7 and Samuel said to
Saul Yahweh sent me to anoint you King
over his people Israel now therefore
listen to the words of
Yahweh thus says Yahweh of
hosts I have noted what amalec did to
Israel in opposing them on the way when
they came up out of Egypt now go and
strike amalec and devote to destruction
all that they have do not spare them but
kill both man and woman child and infant
ox and sheep camel and
Donkey now skip down to verse
7 and Saul defeated the amalekites from
havalah as far as Shure which is east of
Egypt and he took AAG the king of the
amalekites
alive and devoted to destruction all the
people with the edge of the sword but
Saul and the people spared AAG and the
best of the sheep and of The Oxen and of
the fattened calves and the Lambs and
all that was good and would not utterly
destroy them all that was despised and
worthless they devoted to
destruction now let's just stop there
here's Saul's first
sin flagrant Disobedience to the
Commandment that God had given him so
now let's see how Saul
responds when God's Prophet confronts
him with this sin and as we read this
next portion of the narrative I want you
to think about what do you see in Saul
what tactics do you see him employ to
evade the necessity of repentance on his
part start reading with me in verse 10
of chapter
15 the word of Yahweh came to
Samuel I regret that I have made Saul
King for he has turned back from
following me and has not performed my
Commandments and Samuel was angry and he
cried to Yahweh all night and Samuel
Rose early to meet Saul in the morning
and it was told Samuel Saul came to
Carmel and behold he set up a monument
for himself and turned and passed on and
went down to
gilgal and Samuel came to Saul and Saul
said to him blessed be you to Yahweh I
have performed the Commandment of
Yahweh and Samuel said what then is this
bleeding of the sheep in my ears and the
Lo of The Oxen that I
hear Saul said they have brought them
from the amalekites for the people
spared the best of the sheep and of The
Oxen to sacrifice to Yahweh your God and
the rest we have devoted to
destruction then Samuel said to Saul
stop I will tell you what Yahweh said to
me this night and he said to him speak
and Samuel said though you are little in
your own eyes are you not the head of
the tribes of Israel Yahweh anointed you
King over Israel and Yahweh sent you on
a mission and said go devote to
destruction the Sinners the amalekites
and fight against them until they are
consumed why then did you not obey the
voice of
Yahweh and Saul said to Samuel I have
obeyed the voice of Yahweh I have gone
on the mission on which Yahweh sent me I
have brought AAG the king of amalec and
I have devoted the amalekites to
destruction but the people took of the
spoil sheep and oxen the best of the
things devoted to destruction to
sacrifice to Yahweh your God at gilgal
and Samuel said has Yahweh as great
Delight in burnt offerings and
sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
Yahweh behold to obey is better than
sacrifice and to listen than the fat of
Rams for Rebellion is as the sin of
divination and presumption is as
iniquity and
idolatry because you have rejected the
word of Yahweh he has also rejected you
from being
King Saul said to Samuel I have sinned
for I have transgressed the Commandment
of Yahweh and your words because I
feared the people and obeyed their voice
now therefore please pardon my sin and
return with me that I may bow before
Yahweh and Samuel said to Saul I will
not return with you for you have
rejected the word of Yahweh and Yahweh
has rejected you from being King over
Israel as Samuel turned to go away Saul
seized the skirt of his robe and it tore
and Samuel said to him Yahweh has torn
the Kingdom of Israel from you this day
and has given it to a neighbor of yours
who is better than you and also the
glory of Israel will not lie or have
regret for he is not a man that he
should have
regret then he said I have sinned yet
honor me now before the Elders of my
people and before Israel and return with
me that I may bow before Yahweh your
God so Samuel turned back after Saul and
Saul bowed before
Yahweh skip down verse
34 then Samuel went to Rama and Saul
went up to his house in giba of Saul and
Samuel did not see Saul again until the
day of his death but Samuel grieved over
Saul and Yahweh regretted that he had
made Saul King over
Israel now I know that's a long
reading but there's some things that I
want to point out here about all the
different tactics three specifically
that Saul uses maybe you caught him as
we
read now we're going to look at those
three tactics of Saul but notice on the
screen I'm not wording this as here's
what Saul does to evade repentance I'm
wording it is here's what we do because
the things that Saul does are the same
tactics we use we're not looking at this
to learn about Saul although that will
happen we're looking at this to learn
about
ourselves what are the things that we
see Illustrated in Soul that are in our
hearts as well here's one of them we try
to evade
repentance by manipulating The
Narrative one of the ways that we try to
evade
repentance is by manipulating The
Narrative the first tactic we see Saul
use is in verse 13 do you notice the
first thing he says to
Samuel in verse
13 first thing he says is Samuel came to
Saul and Saul said to him blessed be you
to Yahweh I have performed the
Commandment of Yahweh in other words his
first tactic to evade repentance is to
manipulate the narrative as if he has
done everything God said he was supposed
to
do almost like a little kid have you
ever had this happen where you maybe
open the door and discover that little
kids are doing something wrong and
before you can even say anything the kid
goes I wasn't doing anything that's kind
of what we see Saul here I have obeyed
the voice of Yahweh he tries to get that
in real quick Samuel of course sees
through it he'll have none of
it and so after that Saul tries a
different way of manipulating The
Narrative you see what he does in verse
15 look at verse
15 Saul then said they they have brought
them from the amalekites for the people
spared the best of the sheep and of The
Oxen to sacrifice to Yahweh your
God Saul tries to
depict what's happened not as an act of
Disobedience but as an act of piety well
we spared these because the people were
going to sacrifice them to God what's
wrong with
that and so this is another way that he
tries to manipulate the narrative as if
there's nothing going on here that's
wrong this was a good thing that I have
done and that the people have
done we utilize this same
tactic when we're confronted with our
sins you ever done
this have you ever tried to misrepresent
the situation to make it seem like
you're actually innocent I really didn't
do anything in this
situation I've done
that because we don't want our sin
exposed to the
light have you ever tried to well in
your explanation of things you highlight
certain actions that you did and
minimize others to make you look less
guilty so it's really not as severe as
you're saying here you ever done
that I've done
that when we do that
brethren we are a liar just like
Saul or a
liar a second tactic that we employ that
we see Illustrated in Saul to evade
repentance is appealing to group
fault appealing to group
fault we've already seen in verse 15
where Saul says the people
took but look also at verses 20 and
21 Saul said to Samuel I have obeyed the
voice of Yahweh I have gone on the
mission on which Yahweh sent me I have
brought AAG the king of amalec and I
have devoted the amalekites to
destruction but the people
took the spoil the Sheep The Oxen the
best of the things devoted to
destruction to sacrifice to Yahweh your
God Saul
appeals to the sin of the group to make
his sin look lesser that Samuel you
really shouldn't be talking to me
talking to the people they're the ones
who took all this stuff they're really
the ones you should be talking
to and there's something else Saul does
here that's subtle it's easy to
miss Saul also tries to appeal to The
Faults of the
group in a way that yes it shifts the
blame to them but also so that it can
make him look like he's actually
confessing a lesser
wrong and we see this when you
compare the accurate description of
Saul's sin in verse 19 with his
description of his sin in verse 24 look
at verse 19 and look how Samuel
describes what Saul has
done verse
19 why then did you not obey the voice
of Yahweh why did you pounce on the
spoil and do what was evil in the sight
of
Yahweh in other
words an accurate description of what's
happened here is that Saul knew what had
God Saul knew what God had told him to
do he flagrantly disobeyed it because he
saw The Spoils of War and his greed told
him I'd rather have that for myself I'm
not going to obey God I want to pounce
on the spoil as Samuel describes it but
now look at how Saul describes the
situation in verse
24 Saul said to Samuel
I have sinned for I have transgressed
the Commandment of Yahweh and your words
because I feared the people and obeyed
their
voice in other words Saul does not say
Samuel you're right I was overcome with
greed and I just disobeyed God's
word he
says I wasn't as authoritative as I
should have
been so yeah Samuel you know the people
took of that but but yeah you're right I
was wrong I I should have been more
Stern I I should have been more
authoritative you see what Saul has done
here in appealing to group fault he's
tried to shift the blame to them but
also give a little semi confession to
try to make it seem like he's actually
confessing something but he's not
confessing the true sin that he's
committed he's trying to make
himself or his Disobedience look less
severe
sometimes to keep from repenting we do
this exact same
thing we highlight others actions to
take ourselves out of the
spotlight well why are you talking to me
when they're doing this over
here you ever said
that well yeah I I did that but you know
it really isn't as bad as you're saying
I mean really what I should have done
was I should have maybe spoke spoken up
so yes I mean I I was wrong there I
should have just spoken up or yes I I
did this but this is really a problem
that a lot of people struggle with and
so and so we appeal to the sins of the
group to try to dilute our own
culpability so let's just say it
candidly
here a larger group's
actions has nothing to do with our
choice of whether to repent of our own
sin when we're confronted with our sin
what matters is whether we respond with
repentance not what anyone else is doing
not what other people may struggle with
or what they've done or whether you feel
like well they need to be spoken to too
it doesn't matter how are you responding
because when you start trying to evade
your own responsibility you become King
Saul the last tactic that we see Saul
evade or or use to evade
repentance is addressing the image or
addressing uh our image instead of our
sin addressing our image instead of the
sin Saul is not
concerned with his
heart he's concerned about his image and
this is hinted at it's foreshadowed in
verse 12 look at verse 12 of 2 Samuel
two and Samuel Rose early to meet Saul
in the morning and it was told
Samuel Saul came to Carmel and behold he
set up a monument for
himself and turned and passed on and
went down to gilgal why do you think
that detail was included in the
story because it shows you what Saul
really cares about it's foreshadowing
the type of person you're about to see
interact with Samuel here and it comes
to the four then in Saul's words look at
verse
24 Saul said to Samuel I have sinned for
I have transgressed the Commandment of
Yahweh in your words because I feared
the people and obeyed their voice now
therefore please pardon my sin and
return with me that I may bow before
Yahweh now on the surface that doesn't
sound like a bad thing to say but look
at verse 30 here's where his real
concern comes out then he said I have
sinned yet honor me now before the
Elders of my people and before
Israel and return with me that I may bow
before Yahweh your God do you see what
Saul's interested
in His image how do I look in front of
the people don't let them see you reject
me come back with me so that they can
see that we're
okay
sometimes we pull this same
trick we have our sin
exposed and then our
response is an
intense outward religious fervor I'm
going to use this to teach a Bible class
I got to get more involved in worship
service I'm G to I'm going to lead
devotionals I'm going to do all this and
we put on this
show because we want our Brethren to see
I'm okay now I'm okay don't look over
here I I tripped up yep I Tri but I'm
good now I'm
fine and we have not addressed the sin
and what's in our heart that caused us
to commit that sin or we haven't made
restitution to the people that we've
wronged we haven't sought their
forgiveness but we want to put on a good
show and may I just say as on aside this
is a side point not a main point may I
just say that this is a an a especially
important tactic for us to think about
as a church because we as a church in
our well-intentioned uh desire to
support sinners in Repentance we can end
up enabling this type of Sal tactic in a
sinner because when their sin is exposed
and they want to get more involved we
cheer them on and we say oh yeah that's
great yeah let them let them talk about
it let them lead more in worship isn't
that a great sign of repentance and we
end up enabling that sin sinner because
what we fail to emphasize to them is
none of that outward stuff
matters that's not what you need right
now you need to
address your heart that caused you to
commit that sin you need to make
restitution to the people that you've
wronged have you sought their
forgiveness have you made restitution to
them we need to see fruits of repentance
as Jesus
said and so that's an side but I I feel
that he just said I think it's an
important one because of how churches
again well-meaning churches have ended
up allowing
Sinners to not show True repentance and
to get away with things they shouldn't
have gotten away
with because the church made the mistake
of thinking that the outward public
worship displays Were Somehow
necessarily a sign the person's heart
had been dealt with and it
wasn't
so these three tactics that we see in
Saul these are not the only tactics that
we use to evade repentance but they're
the three that we see here in this
text we'll ma we'll make some
applications from this in just a moment
but before we move on to the
demonstration of repentance may I just
say one more thing about this text what
is missing in this text what does God's
Prophet not say to Saul in response of
his
confessions
there is no statement of
forgiveness nowhere in Samuel's
narrative here or anywhere else does
God's Prophet say to Saul you are
forgiven God has taken away your sin
because as you read The Narrative of
Samuel it's very clear Saul was not
penitent outwardly he may do some things
but inwardly he was not penitent in fact
he continues to plummet into deeper and
deeper rebellion in the rest of the
narrative until God finally takes his
life because of his
sin what does that say to us when we act
like Saul when we're confronted with our
sin now if Saul is a example of an
evasion of repentance who is the example
of a demonstration of repentance well
it's Saul's foil you could say it's King
David would you go to 2 Samuel
12 let's look at an example example of
what true repentance looks like go to 2
Samuel
12 now in this narrative I'm sure you're
familiar with the general story David
has committed egregious
sins he has stolen another man's
wife had an affair with her got her
pregnant and when he discovered that she
was pregnant his solution after several
other attempts was to have her husband
murdered so that he could cover it up
and then he took her as his wife and it
looked like for a while he got away with
it but then God sends him Nathan the
prophet now Nathan as you know or may
remember he tells David this parable of
a man who had a lamb stolen from him to
get David to kind of crack open his
heart as one Minister said I liked that
to crack open David's heart to show him
what he had done look at 2 Samuel 12 and
start reading reading with
me in verse 5 let's see David's response
to this scenario Nathan has presented to
him then David's anger was greatly
kindled against the man and he said to
Nathan as Yahweh lives the man who has
done this deserves to die and he shall
restore the lamb fourfold because he did
this thing and because he had no pity
Nathan said to David you are the
man
thus says Yahweh the god of Israel I
anointed you King over Israel and I
delivered you out of the hand of Saul
and I gave you your Master's house and
your Master's wives into your arms and
gave you the house of Israel and of
Judah and if this was too little I would
add to you so much more why have you
despised the word of Yahweh to do what
is evil in his sight you have struck
down Uriah the hittite with the sword
and have taken his wife to be your wife
and have killed him him with the sword
of the amonites now therefore the sword
shall never depart from your house
because you have despised me and have
taken the wife of yah the hittite to be
your wife thus says Yahweh behold I will
raise up evil against you out of your
own house and I will take your wives
before your eyes and give them to your
neighbor and he shall lie with your
wives in the sight of this son for you
did it secretly but I will do this thing
before all Israel and before the son
David said to
Nathan I have sinned against
Yahweh Nathan said to
David Yahweh has put away your sin you
shall not
die you see the difference between David
and
Saul
what does David not
do he does not try to manipulate the
narrative he does not make
excuses he simply makes a
confession I have sinned against
Yahweh and can we do this before we look
at David and and put some things down in
our notes and then begin to wrap up
would you flip over to Psalm 51 what
Neil just read for us a few minutes
ago we're going to come back to 2 Samuel
12 maybe sorry maybe put a marker there
I didn't say that to you before if
you're using a physical Bible but maybe
put a marker there if you haven't
flipped yet we're going to come back to
2 Samuel 12 but I want to show you Psalm
51 because what is succinctly stated in
2 Samuel 12 where David just says I have
sinned it's easy to kind of read over
that and it's just very succinctly
stated but when you look at Psalm 51
you'll see the heart of a man who is
truly broken over what he has done I
don't know if you've noticed this but
you see the heading of Psalm 51 in your
Bible it says to the choir Master a
Psalm of David when Nathan the prophet
went to him after he had gone into bath
Sheba this Psalm will give you insight
into David's heart on what true
repentance looks like would you start
reading with me in verse one here's an
example of true
repentance
have mercy on me oh God according to
your steadfast love according to your
abundant Mercy blot out my
transgressions Wash Me thoroughly from
my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin
for I know my transgressions and my sin
is ever before me against you you only
have I sinned and done what is evil in
your sight so that you may be just
justified in your words and blameless in
your
judgment
behold I was brought forth in
iniquity and in sin did my mother
conceive me behold you Delight in truth
in the inward being and you teach me
wisdom in the secret heart Purge me with
hup and I shall be clean wash me and I
shall be whiter than snow let me hear
joy and gladness let the bones that you
have broken
rejoice hide your face from my sins and
blot out all my
iniquities create in me a clean heart oh
God and renew a right Spirit Within Me
cast me not away from your presence and
take not your Holy Spirit from me
restore to me the joy of your salvation
and uphold me with a willing
Spirit then I will teach transgressors
your ways and sinners will return to to
you deliver me from blood guiltiness oh
God oh God of my salvation and my tongue
will sing aloud of your
righteousness oh Lord open my
lips and my mouth will declare your
praise for you will not Delight in
sacrifice or I would give
it you will not be pleased with a burnt
offering the sacrifices of God are a
broken Spirit a broken and contrite
heart oh God you will not
despise we'll stop
there this is what true penitence looks
like a heart that is humbled and
recognizes the egregious nature of their
sin and confesses it fully before
God and thus if you flip back to 2
Samuel 12 or you can just listen there
just one line in 2 Samuel 12 I want to
highlight
because of David's attitude of
repentance we have in 2 Samuel 12 what
was missing in the entire account of
Saul in 2 Samuel
12:13 David said to Nathan I have sinned
against
Yahweh and Nathan said to David Yahweh
has put away your sin you will not
die we'll say one more thing about
second 12 but let's put these on the
screen briefly here before we begin to
wrap up from David what we see is that
true repentance includes an immediate
confession true repentance includes an
immediate
confession we already said David doesn't
make any excuses and and think of all
the excuses that people can give when
they're caught in this example caught in
an affair I was just so tired I was I
was overwork
you know I was just so
stressed all those things may be
true but true repentance recognizes at
the end of the day those things don't
matter I chose to do
this I chose to do
it so from David we learn that true
repentance includes an immediate
confession and then second we learn from
David that true repentance as we've
already said doesn't make
excuses it doesn't make
excuses and then
third we see that true repentance
expresses
remorse it expresses
remorse when you look at Psalm
51 you see the heart of a
man who is
broken because of his remorse over his
sin when somebody makes a confession
quote unquote of sin and there's no
remorse that's not a
confession that's not true
repentance true repentance expresses
remorse and then fourth and
finally we see from David that true
repentance results in
forgiveness what we didn't see in
Saul true repentance results is results
in
forgiveness God's forgiveness is open to
all but it is only
given to those who
repent and you see that not just in
Saul's case but all throughout the Bible
that is a Common Thread the
unrepentant do not get
forgiveness only those who repent before
God David repented of his sins and as
egregious as they were God forgave
him because he
repented and so from
David we have a Biblical example of what
true repentance looks like a
demonstration of repentance let's close
with these applications here let me just
give you three applications and we'll be
done the first application is in the
form of a question that this text forces
us to consider for ourselves
when you're confronted with your sin are
you more like Saul or
David when I'm confronted with my
sin am I more like Saul or
David when you're confronted with your
sin whether it's maybe you read the
Bible maybe you read a passage and it
convicts you or maybe you immediately
commit a sin and your conscience already
Pricks you or maybe it's something that
you've heard in a Bible class or a
sermon and it convicts you or maybe
somebody brings your sin to you to your
attention however you're confronted with
your sin when it is put before you how
do you respond
characteristically like
Saul and let me just pull all these
tactics and evade repentance and this
won't stick and well you didn't really
see that and all this
or do we respond like David and we just
confessed I've
sinned I've sinned against
God and here's why this question is so
important and I've already alluded to it
this question is so important because of
our second application here evading
repentance leaves us under God's
condemnation evading repentance leaves
us under God's
condemnation there is no person in the
Bible
there is no person in the
Bible who was
unrepentant and God forgave
him you won't find
one every sinner who is Forgiven in
scripture repented true
repentance maybe you've got a sin in
your life right
now that you have not repented
of maybe God's word has convicted you or
someone has brought it to your attention
however you've been confronted with it
maybe it's words of anger you lost your
temper and you've said words of anger to
someone and you've not apologized for
that maybe it's how you've mistreated
your
spouse or maybe it's how you've
mistreated someone else in your
life maybe it's things you've been
stealing you think you've gotten away
with it no one's discovered
it maybe it's sexual
sin with a person or sexual sin on your
own with your
computer maybe it's lies you've been
telling maybe it's a lie you've been
telling to cover up another sin so
you're just adding sin to your account
whatever the sin
is God is calling you to not be like
Saul God brings sin to our
attention because of our final
application showing Repentance will
result in God taking away our
sin showing Repentance will result in
God taking away our sin Brethren when
God brings our sin to our attention
however ever he does
it it is an act of
love because he is trying to get us to
get us to repent so that we can enjoy
the blessings of his
forgiveness so that we can enjoy his
presence for
eternity true repentance is often
painful and it can be difficult it
requires us to Humble our ourselves and
it requires us to expose things we'd
rather not have exposed it requires us
sometimes to suffer some very intense
Earthly consequences for our
sin but while those things might be hard
in the
shortterm the long-term benefit of true
repentance is the joy of his forgiveness
and his eternal
presence God has gone to Great
Lengths to give us the blessing of his
forgiveness and so let me close with one
more line from 2 Samuel 12 it'll be on
the screen you don't need to turn back
there in the story of
David Nathan told David that God had
taken away his sin yes but Nathan also
said these
words Yahweh has also Yahweh also has
put away your sin you shall not die
nevertheless because by this deed you
have utterly scorned
Yahweh the child who was born to you
shall
die
Brethren this is what God has done for
each one of us in this
room each person in this room has
multiple times in our lives we have
utterly scorned
God and therefore we deserve
death but instead of exacting that
penalty from us God has said to each one
of
us Yahweh has taken away your
sin the son of David will die in your
place each one of
us can have life because the ultimate
son of David Jesus of Nazareth died died
for our sin just as David went through
in a prefigurement of what God would
ultimately do for the
world this is how
much God wants us to be with
him so when he confronts us with our
sin don't act like
Saul don't reject his
invitation be like David and repent
so that you can experience the joy of
his
forgiveness and if there's a public
confession that you need to make
tonight one of the elders will be up
here in just a moment but even if it's
not public let tonight be the night when
whatever sin you know is in your life
that you've not repented of be like
David show True repentance
confess
show those fruits of repentance and you
will enjoy the blessing of God's
forgiveness and eternal presence if
there's anything we can do for you as a
church please come forward while we
stand the invitation song
