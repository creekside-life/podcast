you know
naysayers if you listen to them which
probably shouldn't we'll try to convince
you to give up on
evangelism it's already a hard thing to
do probably only 3 to 6% of Any Given
congregation are really ever actively
involved in
evangelism that's been pretty
consistently true for the history of the
church as far as I can remember not that
many people actually do that that much
effort of trying to sit down and teach
somebody about Christ we can all invite
people to church but it's not
necessarily that Pleasant to do these
days and the world will try to convince
you to leave them
alone Charles Swindle in one of his
books called kindred spirit says these
three or four examples he mentions a
memo from the testing director of
MGM shortly after the first first screen
test of a particular actor and this is
what he said he can't act he's slightly
bald and he can dance a little Fred a
stare an old expert once said of another
young coach he possesses minimal
football knowledge but he lacks
motivation he said that of Vince
Lombardi
some of this stuff is too old for show
y'all I can see that his parents
believed his teacher and so they urged
him to become an
engineer the teacher said about him he
has no voice at all and he just cannot
sing that child was enrio
Caruso he was fired by a newspaper
editor because he said he had a lack of
ideas oh I wish we had him back his name
was Walt
Disney his teachers gave up on him and
said quote he's too brainless to do
anything his name was Thomas
Edison people will say things negatively
about you if you speak to them about
Jesus Ecclesiastes 7: 21 in the easy to
read Bible says do not take to heart
everything people say lest you hear your
servant cursing
you don't pay too much attention to what
the world says about you or about us or
about speaking about Jesus trying to
teach the faith is difficult in the best
times and it can be discouraging at
times
today it's getting kind of discouraging
here are a few stories I've heard a
teacher in New Jersey was suspended for
giving a student a
Bible a football coach in Washington was
placed on leave for praying after a game
with his kids a fire chief in Atlanta
was fired for publishing a book on
Christian
morality a marine was Court marked
for pasting a Bible verse above her
desk and most of us have had a friend or
a family member who mocked us I bet
you've probably heard this statement and
you call yourself a
Christian I don't know if you know this
but being in
Ministry is U one of of those things
that kind of draws a Target on your back
these days so I've been ridiculed and
hated by lots of people uh by friends
I've had friends turn on me I've had
family members turn on me and try to
ruin
me uh 40 plus years of preaching I
promise you there's been a Min a Monday
I wed to quit been a many a Monday I
spit in tears
just want to let it
go and now as old as I am it's going to
happen one of these days are we fit to
keep plowing
anyway are you willing to keep plowing
anyway to speak a word for the Lord
anyway in Luke chap 9 verse 62 Jesus
said no one having put his hand to the
plow of course none of us plow like that
anymore but once upon a time when he had
a mule you put your hand on the plow and
you held on for dear
life and he took off and no one having
put his hand to the plow and looking
back while he's plowing that direction
is fit for the kingdom of God because
you will not plow a straight line I
promise you
that our text has three sources of power
for the endurance given for evangelism
the
endurance given for evangelism you may
not have been evangelizing yet may have
been something almost off your list it's
time to put it back on you are a child
of God and the world depends on
you do you hear
me they depend on you your friends your
family you're important
let's look at three the endurance given
for evangelism is found in the power of
God's Proclamation the power of God's
Proclamation we speak in it we should
speak in it you'll understand that
statement in just a moment a little
better in Luke Chapter 10:9 it says and
heal the sick there and say to them so
there are things we are called to say
the kingdom of God has come near you but
whatever city you enter and they do not
receive you go out into the street and
say there are things you need to say not
just sit there you need to speak the
very dust of your city which clings to
us we wipe off against you oh that's
ugly you need to learn to say things
that they find
offensive say it nevertheless know that
that the kingdom of God has come near
you say that but I say to you that it
will be more tolerable in the day of
Sodom and Gomorrah than for that city
folks you need to have more courage you
need to believe in what you believe in
and be willing to say it say his words
quote them speak of his gospel speak
about it and speak in in Kingdom
language quit letting everybody run you
off of Kingdom language well they don't
understand what atonement means some of
you don't know what atonement means use
the word anyway let them learn they need
to learn so his way not my way not your
way his way is preaching that means you
speak other people need to listen not
you listen to them all day long along
there are things you know they don't
know you need to speak and they need to
listen that's preaching just like I'm
doing right now right you're sitting
there in listening right and I'm
speaking 1 Peter 4:1 if anyone speaks
let him speak as the Oracles of God so
use the the Bible folks 1 Corinthians 1
verse 211 for since in the wisdom of God
the world through wisdom did not know
God it pleased God through the foolish
nness of the message preached to save
those who believe so it is your duty to
preach it this isn't a subject thing
where everybody just gets to talk and
let everybody speak yeah that's fine
they get to speak but you need to preach
1 Corinthians 4:10 we are fools for
Christ's sake but you are wise in Christ
we are weak but you are strong you are
distinguished but we are Dishonored that
may be the way the world feels toward
you go ahead 1 Thessalonians 5:20 says
you may be despised for preaching and
yeah you're to be a preacher I'm not the
preacher and all of you are just
listeners no you're to be a preacher you
call to preach the gospel to the whole
world it didn't say share the gospel
with the whole world it says preach the
gospel proclaim the gospel to the whole
world and more than that first Kings
22:8 it says they'll hate you for it
buckle
up my sermons may be
weak I may be weak not going to
argue but
Proclamation is God's
way and you and I need to get on board
and a source of endurance given for
evangelism is to understand it's his way
to Proclaim not just share but
Proclaim his word number
two the endurance given for evangelism
is found in the power of persuasion so
how do you keep doing
it you Proclaim it anyway but more than
that you need to understand how
persuasive it is believe in it one of
the greatest books I've ever read that
encouraged me to preach when I was about
ready to quit about 40 years ago is a
book by Sangster you probably don't know
he's long dead now but sster had one
little chapter in it says believe in
it just believe in it do you believe in
it if you believe in it you got to share
it listen to Luke chap 10 verse 13
beginning it's up here on your screen
woe to you czen woe to you Bea can you
say things like that today oh but you
should for if the mighty Works which
were done in you had been done in tire
and siden they would have repented long
ago sitting in sackcloth and Ashes every
anybody repenting in sackcloth and Ashes
lately maybe we're not doing what we
need to be doing verse 14 but it will be
more tolerable for TI and siden at the
day of judgment then for you and you
Capernaum who are exalted to Heaven
because that's where Jesus even lived
for a little while we'll be brought down
to Hades verse 16 he who hears you hears
me he who rejects you rejects me and he
who rejects me rejects him who sent me
God is mighty and his word is mighty to
convict you don't have to be
clever you don't have to be fancy the
word of God will do what it needs to do
start believing in it
why do you think I'm having you speak it
it is powerful it changes on its own his
word is persuasive it is powerful
Genesis 1 and verse3 I bet you remember
this then God
said let there be light and there
was you believe it that's how powerful
his word
is in Isaiah 55: 10- 11 it says this for
as the rain comes down and the snow from
heaven and do not return there it's
weird how it works isn't it but they
water the Earth and make it not help it
make it that's why we need rain folks
and make it bring forth and Bud that it
may give seed to the soar and break to
the eater we're grateful for it right
you eat verse 11 so shall my word so
shall my word be that goes forth from my
mouth it shall not return to me void but
it shall accomplish what I please it
does exactly what I wanted to do if you
will just speak it and it shall Pro
prosper in the thing for which I sent it
so you got to believe in it to speak it
first you need to speak it then you need
to learn to believe in the power of it
acts chap 6 and verse 10 says and they
were not able to resist the wisdom and
the Spirit by which he spoke when the
word of God Is Spoken there is no
argument to be made
literally Grace is irresistible
when understood my abilities as your
preacher or as a
Christian may be
unconvincing I'm not very convinced M at
times may even be doubtful okay but his
word persuades not your word not your
clever
argument his word you don't have to be
clever you don't have to be
cunning and out argue people quit
thinking like that just share the word a
source of the endurance given for
evangelism is God's persuasion and that
is you just need to
believe in his word you need to believe
in his way and Proclamation you need to
believe in his word that it has
persuasive power and then the endurance
given so you'll keep doing it the
endurance given for evangelism is found
in the power of God's protection cuz I
know people get nervous well they'll
hurt my feelings they'll say something
ugly to
me rest in God's protection rest in it
listen to Luke 10 continuing verse 17
then the 70 returned with Joy saying
Lord even the demons are subject to us
in your name
do you hear that folks the demons are
scared of the word of
God and he said to them I saw Satan fall
like lightning from
Heaven the word of God can knock Satan
to the
ground behold I give you Authority now
listen this wasn't just to them this is
to you as well you've been given
Authority okay to go into all the
world I give you authority to trample on
serpents that is devils and scorpions
that is the Devils that come to you
two-legged devils and over all the power
of the enemy and nothing shall by any
means hurt you quit
worrying nevertheless do not rejoice in
this that the spirits are subject to you
but rather Rejoice because your name
names are ridden in heaven I noticed
y'all all love the way that ended I
don't know if you listened to what
happened before that but you really
loved it a while ago the way that
passage ends CU it's
wonderful he and his work is protected
in Isaiah 45: 23 I sworn by myself this
is the Lord talking I have sworn by
myself not by some book or I didn't put
my hand on the Bible he said I swore by
myself there's nothing higher I've sworn
by myself the word has gone out of my
mouth in righteousness and shall not
return that means it won't return void
it will accomplish what I say and shall
not return that to me every knee shall
bow and every tongue shall take a oath
what is that that means God is going to
do what God said he's going to do and
his word does exactly what he says his
word does Isaiah 54: 17 says this no
weapon that includes little barbs on
people's tongues no weapon formed
against you shall prosper and every
tongue which Rises against you in
judgment you shall condemn how dare you
speak that way after I've quoted the
word this is the heritage of the servant
of the Lord and their righteousness is
from me says the Lord is that true for
us was it just true for them second
Corinthians chapter 5 and verse 21 says
that he has become sin for us that we
might become the righteousness of God if
you're righteous today it's God's
righteousness that's been poured out on
you and your sins's been taken away by
Christ Jesus 1 Peter 1 and verse 5 who
are kept kept in the Bible doesn't mean
to hold you but it means to protect you
to guard you to stand as a soldier
around you that's what you are you are
kept do you not know that you're kept
you think you got this way this safely
without being torn apart by lions by
your own goodness I tell you that's not
the reason you're as well off as you are
you are kept but listen you're not kept
for just any reason but you are kept
kept by the power of God through faith
for salvation ready to be revealed in
the last time God's going to show
everybody who you really
are you see we are
kept but we will have persecution that's
what we're told there will be opposition
so we're not shocked that the world
doesn't want to hear what we've got to
say here you should expect it but more
than that acts 14 say is tribulations
are coming against us why because the
devil hates what we teach and hates the
word of God and hates what you could
share with them and he will do
everything within his power to bring the
church to nothing you need to be aware
so whether I'm talking about myself or
you my
evangelism
will work my work
will
end it's closer now than ever my dad
died at 63 I'm
66 okay course my mom's 92 I may never
die but my evangelizing work will
end yours will as
well your time to do it will
end but his work
endures and it is
protected and it will be finished and he
will accomplish exactly what he planned
to do before he ever
started a source of evangelism given
that will help us
endure is God's protection so that's the
lesson today he wants you to Proclaim it
preach
it his what that's his way
he wants you to understand it's
persuasive that's his word and you need
to know that his work is going to be
protected because he's not doing this
for like a just a weekend activity so we
have something to do on Sundays he's
doing something
here so endure to try to keep doing old
things that no one else is doing anymore
you hear
me do old things things that no one's
doing
anymore endure to try old things that no
one else is
trying no one else hardly and the
crowd's getting smaller have you
noticed some of you almost proud of it
though because you're on the liberal
side but the crowd's getting smaller
that's
non-instrumental have you noticed
the crowd's getting smaller that's not
allowing women to
preach we're not going down that path if
that's something you really want we're
probably not what you
want and we're not changing to make you
feel good about those
things there are serious reasons we're
doing that called that's what it
says and we're not conforming to culture
and it's not easy it's not fun and we
would like to make everybody happy
around us but we're trying to make
someone happy that ain't around us like
that it's called
God not interested if you don't like it
the doors swing both
ways am I making myself clear I'm not
trying to run anybody off but I'm not
trying to make anybody stay that doesn't
like
it you need to learn that there are
times when and so you need to endure to
try old things but more than that you
need to endure to try some new
things up on the stage up here for those
of you who are interested and there'll
be very few I've got six over here and
six over here I've laid out here the
back to the Bible course and I think we
need more people that knows how to teach
that that's going to be talked about in
Bible class this morning I would love
for you to come up and take a look at it
if you have never taught it we've been
teaching this since ever since uh what's
his name now just Bobby Bates since
Bobby Bates came here Bobby bates's Long
dead now he came and he taught us how to
use it it's one of the best things we've
ever done we baptized a couple hundred
people through
it okay now what we've done is because
we're talking about friend speak we're
trying to add ABCs of the faith and use
the easyto read version Bible but the
point is still the same it's basically
the same material slightly altered focus
more on Christ but the idea is folks
that we need to also be willing to try
some new stuff but the bottom line is
are you willing to teach it all are you
willing to teach or is that just
somebody else Church memb Duty and you
aren't ever going to do
that what a
shame we are reworking it but not
reworking the gospel if you try you may
fail I don't want to be embarrassed I
don't want to try and fail oh well all
the rest of us wanted to try and
fail you you you realize this that we've
all tried and fail I've been a minister
now 40 something years whatever it is
believe me first five years of my
Ministry I never baptize a single person
and I taught a lot never baptized single
person cuz it didn't learn how to do it
so I learned how to do it so once you
learn how to do it you can do it it
takes a little while you got to fail a
few times and then you learn how to do
it and you do it and then you start
baptizing more and more and more that's
what happens so we may fail we may fall
we should try to evangelize but you know
what you can do you can get up and you
can try
again and you can try
again

attitude when you walked in oh that's my
Pew whatever you did or fussing about

have the right to say whatever you want
you see here's the truth though you can

Line the Lord will work with you
the father will come
out he'll help you and you'll get
something done for him we're in a work
that's
important it's not just about building a
brand it's not just about having a
lovely little church in the community
that everybody can see the
building it's about the gospel of
Christ and it's
important and I need you to do more than
you're doing we're going to need you to
do a lot more than you're doing when we
expand these buildings but right
now get off your rear
end and do some evangelism volunteer for
prospective members class they need
help there's a lot of people that could
teach here that could more than that
invite somebody invite somebody if you
don't feel like you can
teach invite somebody to church because
now you can actually see
them who needs to repent
here we all do I need to repent we all
need to repent it's not a person here
that doesn't need to repent we all need
to try harder to reach the people around
us the gospel will do it
you got to believe in God's way which is
Proclamation you really do you need to
believe in God's word because it
actually will persuade
people and really and truly you need to
believe in God's protection his work
he's going to see it to the end this is
his work this is not your work this is
not my work this is his work be a part
of it if you've never given your life to
the Lord though you're one of the
persons that might be standing in her
way would you repent of your sins
confess the name of Christ and be
baptized would you do it we'll help you
do it today if you need to come come
while we stand and while we
sing
