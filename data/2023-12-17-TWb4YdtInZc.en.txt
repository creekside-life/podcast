I know we like Christmas mostly most of
us do but Christmas is not fun for
everyone it's not wonderful for everyone
some of you sitting here are probably
not enjoying the
holidays
38% of Americans according to American
Psychological
Association are actually
overstressed during the holidays and it
leads to physical illnesses they say and
depression and
anxiety and others
abuse chemicals drugs
alcohol just to try to relieve some of
the
stress some people are so anxious over
Christmas because they feel like they're
just too busy some of you may be feeling
that right now maybe there's uh
too much to
do you got a lot to get done all these
presents to buy and maybe your budget's
shrinking pretty quick you're too busy
because not just shopping but
everybody's having a Christmas party and
if it's work you got to go to it even if
you don't want
to uh you need to go you got to visit
your
family and some of your family you don't
particularly care
for and you're struggling to do that and
you got organized food
ladies so Christmas day I guess the men
are going to get up and cook Christmas
dinner
right what are you laughing
about Christmas music Here's a weird
concept Christmas music can make people
depressed ain't that
strange I'm not talking about because
you've heard Silent Night for 473 times
on your particular thing but I don't
want talk about if you ever worked in a
department store which I've done in and
just it's the tape and it just it oh
it's just the tape you know and you hear
everything you're just tired of the tape
by the time you threw that's not what
I'm talking about a lot of people are
filled with Nostalgia at this time of
the year and it it's the Nostalgia can
grip you I mean it can really grip you
and some people are nostalgic
because of past Christmases that weren't
good somebody died on Christmas that you
love or right before right after someone
went through something terrible heart
attack stroke something and here it is
or maybe you're feeling nostalgic
because the one I love will not be with
me this Christmas or we can't be with
the people or maybe you've got such a
great Christmas and some people do this
this is the best Christmas ever it'll
never be like this
again and you feel nostalgic about that
and depressed and believe it or not
Christmas music can make you
depressed Elvis
press he made a song famous is written
by Billy Hayes and Jay
Johnson I have a I'll have a
blue Christmas without you I'll be so
blue just thinking about you decorations
of red on a green Christmas tree won't
be the same deer CU you're not here with
me when those blue snowflakes start
falling that's when those blue memories
start
calling a lot of people go through that
maybe you've gone through it you
probably will go through it at some
point so not everybody's sitting here
going W it's Christmas not everybody
wants to wear the hats and the shirts
and Christmas Just Ain't
Christmas without the one you
love the tree is decorated the lights
are strong cheer all in the air and you
feel alone and darker than
ever Christmas music is
unbearable The Emptiness can be
overwhelming and no you're not being a
grinch you're just being
human and you have a right to feel
terrible during difficult times
depression cont take hold and positive
songs can make you feel
negative at least when you're
depressed so this is for those who at
Christmas know all the Pains of
loss how many pains are there oh I don't
know there's death there's divorce
there's Detachment from your family
you're at TDY and you can't be home with
your
family there's a single mother that and
a with an absent
father there's an unhappy child there's
an abandoned abused or rejected person
there's one married to someone
Unfaithful this Christmas there's
someone divorced and alone right
now there's one that feels like they're
the last one ever chosen sometimes
that's in sports or whatever in life
they're left standing there there's the
misused there's the one that didn't get
the
bonus the company may be going out of
business you're going
bankrupt and trying to survive some kind
of personal bankruptcy right now and
still trying to buy
gifts just been told you're not needed
at work you're fired right here the
holidays there's unrequited
love you love someone they don't love
you back anymore they don't love you at
all there's 's the
Widow who's facing Christmas without
their husband there's the widower that's
facing Christmas without their
wife your child may have abandoned you
won't have anything to do with you
anymore your child may have abandoned
the church and the faith and they won't
have anything to do with the Church of
the faith
anymore your husband May abandon you for
a younger woman your wife may have
abandoned you for a wealthier man or
maybe even you're abandoned for a same
sexual
attraction for you it feels like a very
unlovely Christmas not everybody's
there but there are people there so
don't forget that when you're wishing
Merry Christmas to everybody it doesn't
feel the same for
everybody so what are all your cares
that you could cast on Jesus this
Christmas we all have them just read a
moment ago casting all your cares upon
Him for he cares for you does he really
care yes he really does care Isaiah 53:
3 and 4 talks about he cares about our
griefs and our sorrows verse five talks
about our transgressions the things
we've done wrong our iniquities our
troubles he which he gives us peace for
and our sicknesses and he gives us
healing for but sometimes we forget that
he's been there for us for all that
verse six talks about our going astray
and he's there to bring us home our
iniquities he wants to give us
forgiveness Hebrews
4:15 he sympathizes we don't have a high
priest that can't sympathize one just in
the heavens but we have one who is here
and endured what we endureed and felt
what we feel and he can sympathize with
our feelings of infirmities he knows how
you feel so if you are struggling with
sadness at Christmas know that Jesus
really does care so I want to talk about
three of the most heartrending pains
that we can ever endure here at
Christmas you said well it sounds really
depressing I hope you'll get somewhere
else by the end of this so hang on with
me for this little ride he understands
number one what it's like to be despised
and not deserve it see I was talking
about some of you got family or friends
or somebody that doesn't want to have
anything to do with you anymore or maybe
since the Christmas they're not going to
show up they're not coming you're not
going to have them they don't come
because you're not the person they
thought you were and they've cut you
off happens more than you realize in
families Isaiah
53:3 he is despised and rejected by men
this is talking about Jesus A Man of
Sorrows and acquainted with GED and we
hid as it were our faces from him he was
despised and we did not esteem him
despised Our Savior was despised by
men
yeah by the religious people for sure
and the people who had power Psalm 11941
says I am small and
despised yet I do not forget your
precepts maybe maybe your family is
divided right now maybe you feel
despised by
someone maybe you feel like the black
sheep of the family I I've been there
I've been the one that everybody pointed
at before you ever been the black sheep
it's not
fun but this passage suggest I am small
and despised yet I do not forget your
precepts we could give our list of all
our our
faults but do the right thing anyway
even if you're despised and even if
they're wrong for despising you keep his
precepts that's the message here Jesus
knows what it's like to feel
despised and yet do what he did he kept
God's precepts and so let me be in his
precepts and know it so that I can go on
that's the one thing we can do we can do
what's right
amen number two
or he understands what it's like to be
deserted and not deserve it it goes go
on to say In this passage he is despised
and
rejected by men that's worse than just
being despised won't have anything to do
with a Man of Sorrows and acquainted
with grief and we hid we hid you ever
done that you ever seen somebody that
you didn't want to see and you look
away you hid your face oh don't look at
me like you never did
that you did and we hid as it were our
faces from him people on the street
turned
away yeah that
happened they turned away we hid as it
were our faces from him he was despised
and we did not esteem him and second
Timothy 4: 16 and 7 it says this as 16
and 17 it says at my first
offense no one stood with this is the
Apostle
Paul this is the Great great Apostle
Paul Brethren all over the world he'
reached thousands going to heaven
because of him if not today billions are
partly going to heaven because of him he
said no one stood with me but all
forsook me but listen may it not be
charged against
them I understand verse 17 but the Lord
stood with
me but the Lord stood with
me but the Lord stood with me and
strengthened me so that the message
might be preached and that all the
Gentiles might hear and I was delivered
out of the mouth of lions okay Jesus was
deserted by his Apostles that's right
you say when was Jesus ever deserted by
his own
Apostles soon as they came they fled 12
guys that way whoa I don't know who he
is
don't even know who he is oh I'll die
for him don't even know who he is oh no
I don't know who he
is don't know what you're talking about
they all deserted
him you ever been
deserted you've been through a divorce
you know what it feels
like it kind of feels like that when
somebody
dies you can kind of resent the dead
person cuz they left you why didn't they
take care
of why did they leave
me
deserted maybe a friend left you you
ever had a friend turn her back on you
won't have anything to do with you ever
again oh I know that feeling had to
happen I know exactly what that feels
like what do you
do here's what you do Jesus knows what
it feels like to feel
deserted let me be in his presence pres
I want the Lord to stand with me if
nobody else wants to be around Rex dton
I would like to think that maybe the
Lord might be willing to be around
me so if you feel deserted cling to the
Lord let me be in his presence and know
it so I can go
on and say to yourself God is with me
anyway number
next he understands what it's like to be
dismissed and not deserve it goes on to
say I'm going to read three and four now
of Isaiah 53 he is despised and rejected
by Men A Man of Sorrows and acquainted
with grief and we had as it were our
faces from him he was despised and we
did not esteem it remember who Jesus was
he was the son of God he was the King of
Kings and the Lord of lords the ground
he stepped on virtually became holy his
clothing would have been holy his sweat
would have been
holy we did not esteem
him surely he has borne our griefs and
carried our sorrows and we esteemed him
stricken smitten of God and
Afflicted he's a nothing
he's a blasphemer Jesus the son of God
was called a
blasphemer of all the things to be
accused
of the one thing that they added to it
he's a
cursed 1 Corinthians chapter 1: 26
through 28 you ever felt like you've
been
dismissed just dismiss
them that's
okay for you see your calling Brethren
that not many wise oh he's not very
smart according to the flesh not many
mighty oh he's not very
strong not many noble a he's not a
person of nobility and grace are
called but God has chosen the
foolish he's a little
dimwitted to put to shame the wise and
God has chosen listen to this God has
chosen the foolish God has chosen the
weak to put to shame the things which
are Mighty God has chosen the base God
has chosen the things which are
despised God has chosen and the things
which are not God's chosen that too to
bring to nothing the things that are God
has
chosen so if you're all the other things
and you think you're hot stuff God
didn't choose you you get the
message unless you are a little bit
dismissed you may have a
problem see family church maybe your
family's dismissed you maybe the church
you feel like's dismissed you maybe
somebody at church has dismissed you
maybe you feel like even the leaders of
the church have somehow dismissed
you yet what I would encourage you to do
is let it all go
I know you can hold these things to your
heart Let It
Go
God wants you to
know you're the one he's
picked you're his
preference you're his
preference Jesus knows what it's like to
feel
dismissed he was his
preference let me be in his preference
and know it so I can go on she's nothing
he's nothing he's inferior he's wrong oh
I felt it all haven't you in the kingdom
in the church oh yeah I've got it all
everybody I've been told what's wrong
with me so many times that I could write
a book I've had books written on me I've
actually had six pages of my faults
handed to me one
day it's
okay you can still be in his pre
preference list so this Christmas give
Jesus your griefs and that's basically
the lesson today give Jesus your griefs
what it's like to be despised and not
deserve it so let me give him my
feelings and of being despised and yet
let me be in his precepts and when I
feel deserted let me be in his presence
and when I feel dismissed let me be
aware that I'm on the list of the ones
he
prefers cling to Jesus and cast all your
cares upon Him that's your
solution I'm sorry if you're having a
rough Christmas I really am you you
should know I understand it's tough it
can be really tough for those who feel
God does not understand you need to get
from this if nothing else
that
that God does care even if you think he
doesn't with all the sadness please
allow the scriptures to speak to you so
I'm going to walk you through a little
section of scripture here and try to get
you to see it the context of the passage
of Isaiah 53 which is what we've been
studying right we were just studying
Isaiah 53 the context of it is
54 and
55 and I encourage you the next time you
read Isaiah 53 that you read
54 and 55 too many people read 53 and
quit and you haven't gathered yet the
great depth of what's been expressed to
you in 53 until you read 54 and 55 let
me read a little bit of 54 verse four do
not fear and remember it's just
expressed Jesus is dying for you do not
fear for you will not be ashamed listen
to that I know you've been embarrassed
by the things you've done you will not
be ashamed neither be disgraced for you
will not be put to shame God is not
going to embarrass you listen to me for
you will forget the shame of your Youth
and will not remember the reproach of
your widowhood anymore more for your
maker is your husband the Lord of hosts
is his name and your redeemer is the
Holy One of Israel he has called the god
of the whole earth for the Lord has
called you like a woman Forsaken and
grieved in spirit imagine yourself as a
woman who's been pushed aside by a man
who could easily divorce you and walk
away from you and wipe his mouth and
laugh about it for the Lord has called
you like a woman Forsaken and grieved in
spirit like a young wife when you were
refused and says your God for I a mere
moment I have forsaken you but with
great mercies I will gather you with a
little wrath I hid my face from you for
a moment but with Everlasting kindness I
will have mercy on you says the Lord
your Redeemer for this is like the
Waters of Noah to me for as I have SW
sworn that the Waters of no would no
longer cover the Earth so have I sworn
that I would not be angry with you nor
rebuke you do you hear that I will not
be angry with you nor rebuke you for the
mountains sh depart and the hills be
removed but my kindness shall not depart
from you nor shall my Covenant of peace
be removed says the Lord who has mercy
on you but listen to chapter 55 don't
miss this you think it's done listen to
verse six I'll just do a little bit
verse six seek the Lord while he may be
found call upon him while he is near
like right this moment let the wicked
forsake his ways in the unrighteous man
his thoughts let him return to the Lord
and He will have mercy on him and to our
God for he will abundantly pardon
for my thoughts oh yes do you see where
this verse Falls in for my thoughts are
not your thoughts see you thought that
was all about being smart how much
smarter he is and how much more he knows
than you has nothing to do with that at
all for my thoughts are not your
thoughts nor are your ways my ways says
the Lord for as the heavens are higher
than the Earth so are my ways higher
than your ways and my thoughts than your
thoughts what is he saying is you don't
even know what Mercy
is when you're at your best and you've
been the most merciful you've ever been
and the kindest you've ever been and you
took pity on somebody like you've never
done it before it wasn't even
Mercy you have no idea because my mercy
your mercy my Mercy mercy your
mercy you don't believe that's true
Psalm
103:1 is a commentary on this statement
listen to what it says for as the
heavens are high above the Earth so
great is his Mercy toward those who fear
Him oh I didn't misinterpret it that's
exactly what it
means amazing
pity
Grace unknown and
love Beyond degree in a small Cemetery
in h England stands a granite tombstone
with this
inscription John Newton clerk once an
Infidel and
libertine a servant of slavers in
Africa was by the rich mercy of our Lord
and Savior Jesus Christ preserved
restored pardoned and appointed to
preach the faith he had long labored to
destroy that's the author of the song
Amazing
Grace my mother once went to Napoleon
about her son seeking a
pardon the young man had committed a
certain
crime twice so it had been overlooked
the first time he's done it
again and he's going to be executed by
Napoleon so the mother
said after they said well he's getting
his Justice he did it twice the mother
said but I don't ask for
justice I plead for
Mercy Napoleon said but your son does
not deserve mercy and the woman cried
sir it would not be Mercy Mercy if he
deserved it and mercy is all I'm asking
for and the emperor said
well then I will have
mercy I think you need to know the god
that you
serve I think you got him almost figured
out that he's some kind of monster some
of you scared to death of him in way you
should not
be if you're swallowed up in sorrow
today seek his Mercy if this is a dark
Christmas for you I'm telling you he
knows how you
feel and if it's you're embroiled in sin
he will have mercy if you will let him
that's it you can have God's Great Mercy
this very day if you need to give your
life to the Lord we want to help you do
that what a great Christmas that would
be for your family but you got to let go
of those griefs you got to see where you
need to actually walk you need to walk
in God's precepts you need to walk in
his presence and you need to do
everything you can in your head to
realize that you are the one he
prefers you need to believe it but if
you're not there we bid you to come
while we stand and while we sing
