Yes. Yes.
So, first thing I've got to do is
introduce myself. Um, if anybody doesn't
know me, um, Rex tells me I am Dr. Seuss
this tonight. So, um, just in case um,
any of the kids are wondering who I am,
I am Dr. Seuss. So, first of all, um,
actually I'm Robert Klouse, one of the
shepherds here. Um
uh and first I wanted to thank Rex uh
for all he does here. Um preparing this
lesson has been a gauntlet of pain for
me. Um I don't know how he does this
week in and week out, but on top of week
in and week out, uh he shares with the
eldership a list
uh maybe two is it two pages now? a
two-page list of your schedule of
sermons that you have planned for the
future. Maybe. Is it just a page or is
it two pages?
Two pages. So, he's got two pages of
sermons uh planned u for the
congregation and um I've been working on
this one for about six months
um which is crazy crazy. Um, but I also
want to thank Rex for um for pushing us
um
as leaders. Um, we're supposed to be
able to teach and we're supposed to be
able to give instruction and doctrine.
And um, those two things I have not been
doing as a shepherd. Uh, that's part of
the qualifications of a shepherd and I
have not been doing it. Uh, lately I've
taught a class. Uh so my um goal is to
teach a class once a year and also to
preach once a year and uh y'all will be
full of me um once a year in my
preaching. Um I know a lot of the guys
who have been up here um giving lessons.
Uh first of all I want to give props to
all those guys. Uh they did a great job
um delivering lessons about different
things. Um,
I was I was really
It's really great to have so many men in
the congregation be able to deliver
lessons
um that weren't just Jesus loves me. Um,
John 3:16,
those type things, but really sermons
that and I just dropped out. really
sermons that meant something uh to me
and hopefully to you um as you um
endeavor to be better Christians in your
walk. Uh like I was saying,
um I've spent some time working on this.
Julie can tell you I've I've um
spent way too much time, I would she
would probably say, working on this. But
I was I had a whole different sermon
that AJ and I had been talking about for
some time that was about fear. And one
sun uh Saturday afternoon that entire
subject changed and it turned into what
we're going to be talking about tonight.
Uh even tonight
um what we're going to do is we're going
to start in one place and we're going to
wind up in a totally different place by
the end of our lesson. Uh, so you're
going to experience some of what I went
through, uh, putting this together. Um,
and hopefully we'll all get something
out of it. But before we do that, let's
pray together.
Our
dear father, we thank you so much that
you allow us to be here as a family,
as lovers of your word
and uh we we thank you that uh you have
expressed your grace to give us a chance
to be with you forever.
We thank you that uh you show us how to
forgive.
you show us, you show us how to be
humble and that uh you show us all the
good things that we should be. Dear
father, help us to watch you and to
learn from you and uh as we go through
this lesson, um
help us to open our hearts and examine
ourselves in the way that uh Paul even
asks the Corinthians to. Dear father, as
we uh get outside of ourselves and think
about the world, uh it's just like I
spoke about this morning. We have a
world that's troubled and we can't help
but think about um people that don't
even know each other throwing bombs at
each other and um the disturbances in
the Middle East and how those things
affect us here in one way or another.
There father, we pray for those people
uh the people are hurting. We pray for
our enemies. We pray that they would uh
come to their senses and they would find
some sort of love or respect one to the
other. And we pray that uh our love
would be extended to them. We thank you
so much that uh you you uh tell us that
you love us enough to forgive us of our
sins as we try our best to walk in the
light in Christ's name. Amen.
So, as Christians, um, we're called to
do many things.
Uh, and tonight, I'd like to walk us
through a few of those things that, uh,
we are strive striving, we should be
striving to do in our Christian walk.
And the one of the reasons why I wanted
to cover these in particular is because
of our marketplace evangelism.
Marketplace evangelism isn't just some
clever uh slogan we use to feel good
about ourselves as we're building
buildings because building buildings
isn't what we're called to do.
But it is one of the ways that we go
about sharing the gospel with our
community
and one of the ways that we share the
gospel that we're we're responsible to
do
and that we are chosen to do when Christ
told us to go into all the world and
preach the gospel that we find in Mark
16:15.
So, I'd like what I'd like to do tonight
is to start where we always start, where
we always should start, and that's by
looking at ourselves first
and asking ourselves
this question. Do we talk or act any
differently than the communities that
surrounds these four walls?
And if we don't, why not?
If we're no different than the community
around us,
then what does Creekide offer the
community?
Can't they just join some club or just
go to some social event?
Are we daring enough to ask ourselves,
do we look or act like the world around
us because we haven't fully committed
our hearts to God? Do we dare to ask
ourselves that?
Is that too harsh? Is that too harsh to
us for us to ask ourselves?
One of the reasons why we struggle so
much is we we all battle with
submission.
No matter how long we've been a
Christian, whether we've been or whether
we even are a Christian, we battle with
submission.
And that's where I'd like to start
tonight is talking about why we fear
submission.
Submission can um
come from a whole lot of different
places.
Many of us fear submission because it's
deeply personal.
Some fear submission because it springs
out of cultural reasons.
We also have a fear of submission
because of psychological
influences that have been woven into our
backstories for different reasons. Our
fear of submission is just some of the
junk that we brought with us when we
decided to obey the gospel.
Even as we grow in our faith, submission
is still an issue we continually face.
And as we learn more and grow deeper
into the knowledge of God,
we have a hard time submitting to what
God wants us to become.
The bottom line is we struggle with
submission because it's a it's a
constant battle each of us deal with in
our own way.
Since we all have our own reason or
maybe reasons, let's look at u five
maybe five reasons of why we struggle
with submission.
The first I would suggest is we struggle
with submission because we fear the loss
of control.
We may fear loss of control because we
don't want to lose our independence.
Submission can be like giving up our
power to decide what is wrong and what
is right for ourselves. And that fear
that feels very unsettling.
We may number two we may struggle with
submission because it because of past
hurts or betrayals.
We may we may have experienced some sort
of manipulation or unhealthy abuse from
an authority figure or some close
someone.
So we associate any submission with that
pain that came from that past situation.
We may struggle with submission because
of a fear of vulnerability. Our truce
true submission requires our trust and
trusting can make a feel a person feel
exposed open to being hurt or maybe hurt
again placing ourselves in a vulnerable
position position and that can be very
unsettling.
Number four, we may struggle with
submission because of our desire for
self-sufficiency.
As a rule, we take great pride in being
self-reliant.
We like being able to point out, I did
this or look what I've accomplished.
It's all about me, me, me. Right? By the
way, the spotlight goes right here.
Right? The spotlight always goes right
here.
We struggle with the idea of having to
lean on someone else, even if that
someone else is God.
True submission requires our trust. I'm
sorry. Ever have someone say church or
God is just a crutch? Have you ever had
someone tell you that? I have. I've I've
had that.
Number five, we may struggle with
submission because of misconceptions
about what strength is.
We may see submission as a weakness
rather than the true act of courage and
faith.
Making our walk match our talk isn't
easy, especially when it involves a
personal change.
There are other reasons that we push
back against submitting to God. But any
one of us could be dealing with one or
even more of these issues or something
else entirely.
Understanding our own fears and why we
struggle with submission can be our
first step to overcoming them.
And it can also be our way of helping
others who are who we are trying to help
or impact in our community.
Before we go any further, I'm going to
pick on brother Lou
and bring out a couple things that he
says often that I I just I hold dear to
my heart. First is, I don't mean no
harm. Usually when he says that, he's
about to stick the knife in some way or
another.
But tonight, I want you to know that I
don't mean no harm. Please keep in mind
as we go through tonight's lesson that
it's been prepared from my heart,
but especially with love to my Creekide
family.
My second Louism is you can't lead folks
where you ain't yourself. I love that
Lou's statement speaks volumes about our
lesson and our lives as Christians.
Before and I'll tell you since being a
shepherd of Creekide, I've had to deal
with some of the junk we're going to
talk about tonight in my own life.
Some of y'all may remember Jack Straen.
He was a former preacher here. If y'all
don't remember Jack, he used to say a
lot of times, this is a coming across my
shoulders first. And I always love that
that statement.
So this is coming first what we're going
to talk about tonight.
So I want us to start by boldly reading
Philippians 3:13-17.
It says, "Brethren, I do not count
myself to have apprehended, but one
thing I do, forgetting those things
which are behind and reaching forward to
those things which are ahead, I press
forward to the goal of the prize of the
upward call of God in Jesus Christ.
Therefore, let us, as many are immature,
have this mind. And if anything you
think otherwise,
God will reveal even this to you.
Nevertheless, to the degree that we have
already attained, let us walk by the
same rule. Let us be of the same mind.
Brethren, join in following my example.
And note those who so walk as to have us
as a pattern.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I did not
read that
out of arrogance.
Neither was it written out of arrogance,
but it was written read
out of love and respect
for the responsibility expected by God
and by you of your shepherds.
We are supposed to be your example.
We are supposed to be able to say follow
us.
Remember,
we can't lead folks where we ain't
already.
So,
what good is it to bring folks into this
place if it feels or acts just like the
world around them?
We've got to realize that whenever
we'll never have an impact on our
community if they don't see something
different inside these walls than from
their workplace, their community, or
what's displayed even within their own
families. So tonight, let's look at some
of the ways we need to be different.
Who's brave enough to ask yourself, have
I given my heart to God?
I'm going to say that again. Have I
given my heart to God because I dropped
out?
Now, that's probably sounds like an odd
question for a Sunday night crowd.
I know at our baptism, we all pick God's
lane, right? At that moment, we should
have decided not only to give our lives
to God, but our hearts as well.
Our question tonight may sound like
something new, but Paul asked the
Corinthians the same question in his
letter in 2 Corinthians 13:5 where he
wrote, "Examine yourselves as to whether
you are in the faith. Test yourselves.
Do you not know yourselves that Jesus
Christ is in you unless indeed you fail
to meet the test?" So, we're asking
ourselves the same thing tonight. Do we
meet the test?
So, even though this our question
tonight is not new, let's consider
Paul's question now 2,000 years later
and search our hearts in the same way
Paul challenged them to.
To do this, let's turn to Galatians
where God provides provides us a couple
of lists to help us desire decide if we
have given our hearts over to him or
not.
God's first list is in Galatians
5:19-21.
And I know that we've all heard this
list before.
Now the works of the flesh are evident
which are adultery, born, uncleanness,
lwdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred,
contentions, jealousies, outbursts of
wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions,
heresies, e envy, murders, drunkenness,
realies, and the like, of which I tell
you beforehand, just as I told you in
the past, that those who practice such
things will not inherit the kingdom. of
God.
I was telling Jeff that um my lesson was
so long that I have cut it in half
twice. So, you're you're welcome. You're
welcome. But one of the one of my edits
was to take out the definitions of all
of these sins. And then I started
thinking,
what good is it if people don't know the
definitions?
So, quickly, we are going to go through
the definition of each one of these.
So this is going to be quick. Adultery,
voluntary sexual relations between a
married person and someone who is not
their spouse.
Fornication, sexual relations outside
the bounds of marriage. This includes
premarital sex,
uncleanness,
often symbolized sinful behaviors or
corrupt desires. Lwdness, shameful,
shameless or inde indecent behavior
especially of sexual nature. Idolatry,
worshiping anything or anyone other than
the one true God.
This includes not only carved images or
pagan gods, but also anything that takes
God's rightful place in a person's
heart, like wealth, power, or even self.
often described as spiritual
unfaithfulness.
Sorcery,
supernatural powers or occult practices
that attempt to manipulate spiritual
forces apart from God. It includes
things like casting spells, consulting
spirits, or using magic for personal
gain. This includes astrology. Weird,
right? Astrology.
The Greek word often translated sorcery
is also linked to the use of po potions
or mindaltering substances.
Hatred, emotional hostility or aversion
often towards people, truth or even
God's ways. This frequency uh contrasts
with glove and is considered a
destructive force that stirs up
conflict.
Contentions, disputes, quarrels or
strife often rooted in pride, anger or
selfish ambition,
jealousies,
uh envy, rivalry or possessiveness,
emotions that lead to strife, division
or even violence. Outbursts of wrath,
sudden controlled explosions of anger,
the kind that erupt without restraint
oren and often cause harm to others.
Selfish ambitions,
pursuing personal gain or advancement at
the expense of others, and without
regard for God's will, it puts one's own
desires, reputation, or success above
love, humility, and service.
dissensions, disagreements or divisions
that disrupt unity, especially within
the body of believers. They're often
fueled by pride, selfishness,
or false teachings. Heresies,
self-chosen beliefs, or teachings that
de deviate from the truth of the gospel.
Envy is a resentful desire
of what someone has someone else has.
Whether it is their possessions, status,
success, or blessings. It's more than
just wanting something. It's the
bitterness that comes from seeing others
enjoy what you don't have. Murders,
premeditated killing of a human, not a
not um accredited
uh to or by warfare.
Drunkenness refers to excessive consult
consumption of alcohol that impairs
judgment and self-control.
Revalries refers to wild excessive
partying marked by indulgences and lack
of restraint. The original Greek word
paints a picture of loud drunken
celebrations often tied to immorality or
idolatry. It is not about enjoying it.
Not it's not about enjoying a
celebration. It's about losing control
in the ways that dishonor God and harm
others.
I'm out.
Thank you.
The sad thing is this list. We can find
this list in any any TV show, any movie.
We can find it in our families.
And unfortunately, they this list is
becoming more and more accepted in our
daily conversations
if not in our lives.
Maybe laugh with our friends who talk
about participating in some of these
sins ourselves
or worse we participate in them on our
own.
So the question is how can we lead the
lost in our community to the god if we
ourselves haven't submitted our hearts
to Christ and are participating in any
of these sins?
What does this say about our hearts?
Luke 6:45 tells us, "Out of the
abundance of our hearts, the mouth
speaks."
Remember our luism. I don't mean no
harm,
but I'm going to keep asking,
do we look or act like the world because
we haven't fully submitted our heart to
God?
Let's read the list again now that you
know the definitions and start asking
yourself, how do I stack up against
God's first list in Galatians?
Now that you know
adultery, fornication, uncleanness,
lwdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred,
contentions, jealousies, outbursts of
wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions,
heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness,
realies, and the like. Are any of these
sins part of your life?
Only you and God know the answer.
How often do we reflect on the these
sins and actively try to remove them
from our lives?
You know, the great thing is as
Christians,
God gives us a second list.
Most of us can probably recite these,
but we're going to actively um but are
we actively working towards them in our
hearts? And that's that was our
scripture reading tonight. Galatians
5:22 through 23. But the fruit of the
spirit is love, joy. Don't you love
these words, love, joy, peace,
longsuffering, kindness, goodness,
faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.
Against such there is no law.
How often do we ask ourselves, did I
just display a spirit of love?
Do I display a life as if I'm filled
with joy?
Do I feel peace in my Christian walk?
If not, why not?
Am I doing or showing others patience?
And that includes traffic, right? That
includes traffic.
Do others see me as being kind? I wonder
if others think I'm good.
Am I seen as a faithful Christian?
How often am I gentle with others?
Do I have good control over myself?
We all know it's hard to exemplify every
one of these traits.
But the thing is, we know that these are
what God wants in our our hearts to look
like and our hearts to be.
Let's not forget Luke 6:45 and 46. A
good man out of the good treasure of his
heart brings forth good, and an evil man
out of the evil treasure of his heart
bring forth evil. For out of the
abundance of the heart, his mouth
speaks. But why do you call me Lord,
Lord, and do not the things which I say?
But still, we know what we want to do
and what we want to be, but we have this
internal fight. We always run into this,
I don't want to, right? We always run
into that, I don't want to.
So, I'd like to suggest three principles
to help us get to where God calls us to
be. And they're simple. They're simple
things. I'm a simple guy. They can't be
very complicated. The first is the love
principle. Love is at the very
foundation of our Christian
relationships
reflecting God's nature along with his
command to love one another. Love is not
just an emotion but in it's an
intentional Chaz's word an intentional
act a choice of kindness compassion and
selflessness
ch
Jesus emphasized love as the defining
characteristic of his followers stating
by all of the by this all men will know
that you are my disciples if you love
one another John 13:35 Five.
Love within Christ Church involves
bearing one another's burdens, showing
hospitality,
maintaining unity, and if it all comes
down to it, just doing our best to put
up with one another because we choose to
love each other. Period.
I was talking to somebody about that
just this morning. We choose to love
each other.
Number two, the forgiveness principle.
Forgiveness is central to our our
Christian walk. It mirrors the mercy God
graciously extends to the to humanity.
Jesus taught that forgiveness to be
limitless. When he answered Peter's
question about how many times you should
forgive this brother, Jesus told him, I
do not say you to you seven times, but
70* 7 in Matthew 18:22.
So can we see that the Bible biblical
forgiveness is not about ignoring
wrongdoing but about seeking
reconciliation and healing.
It requires our own humility and grace
recognizing that we have been forgiven
by God first and should extend that same
mercy to others.
Third and I wanted this I wanted to end
with this this third principle because
it is I think the anchor
and that is the humility principle
by for by far the most essential element
in our Christian relationship is
humility.
Humility fosters unity and selflessness
because it places others needs above our
own.
Scripture teaches that pride is what
leads to division while humility
strengthens the church.
Peter instructs believer believers to
clothe yourselves with humility towards
one another in 1 Peter 5:5.
Humility involves recognizing our
dependence on God, serving others
without seeking recognition, and
embracing our spirit of gentleness and
patience.
Each one of these three principles play
a vital role in us building a strong
unified Christlike Christ centered
relationship within the church.
So let's reflect back on Galatians
5:19-21
again. Adultery, fornication,
uncleanness, lwdenness, idolatry,
sorcery, hatred, contentions,
jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish
ambitions, dissensions, heresies, envys,
murders, drunkenness, realies, and the
like. When we're involved in those type
sins or display traits that come with
those sins, we hurt those around us that
are trying to live godly lives.
The bottom line is when we're practicing
any of the sins that we just read off,
we're sinning against God and we're also
sinning against our our Christian
brothers and sisters because a Christian
walk and a sinful walk just don't mix.
And that's when we start having
conflicts with one another, within the
church, and it hurts the church.
Now, I'm going to confess that I've
unfortunately had conflicts within the
church with brothers
And I've sinned against brothers and
I've had brothers sin against me.
I would hope that this confession would
be mine alone, but I know it probably
isn't.
But neither situation is is comfortable
being the sinner or the sinee, right?
We come to worship, we have that
unsettled issue feeling
with another Christian. We have to avoid
them in the hallway or avoid eye contact
with them and then we seek them out to
make sure that they're not looking at
us.
You know, to say we're distracted from
worship is an understatement.
So let's consider how Christians can
truly be different from our community
and conflict resolution.
Let's delve into the topic of both sides
of the issue. First from the perspective
of one who has been sinned against who
has excuse me who has sinned against his
brother and the other from the
perspective of one who has been sinned
against. So, we've got to turn to
Matthew 5:23-
24
where Jesus says, "Therefore, if you
bring your gift to the altar and there
remember that your brother has something
against you, leave your gift before the
altar and go your way first be
reconciled to your brother and then come
offer your gift." In these verses, Jesus
reveals the magnitude of resolving our
personal conflicts before we should
before we should or maybe I should say
can worship God.
First, we should notice that if we
remember that our brother has something
against us, we should be thinking or
reflecting on our past week as we
consider our worship from God.
I would suggest all of us spend some
time or reflection before we get to the
building in worship prep, thinking about
our past week, thinking about the coming
worship.
How many of us just show up without any
worship prep and expect our minds to be
ready for worship? It's not going to
happen the way you you want to give your
worship to God.
Second, this reflection shows that we
should be thinking about our fellow
Christians even when we're not at
worship.
And then thirdly,
did we pick up on the place where where
God is involved in this situation?
God, our almighty creator, is willing to
wait on us to reconcile our relationship
with each other
before we even have the chance to
worship him. He'll put his life on hold,
if that's the right phrase, before we'll
we'll he'll allow us to worship.
How many times do we even forget that
God is involved in our relationship with
each other?
How many times have we heard 1 John
4:20, but not really taken it in?
If someone says, "I love God,"
and hates his brother, he is a liar.
For he who does not love his brother,
whom he has seen, how can he love God
whom he has not seen?
And this commandment we have for him,
that he who loves God must love his
brother also.
So, who are we trying to fool when we
come here to sing?
Oh, how I love Jesus.
But I do not love my brother.
Contrast
that with Psalms 95:6 which says,
"Come, let us bow down in worship. Let
us kneel before the Lord our maker."
Doesn't that sound lovely?
Humb ourselves united before God in
humble reverence and adoration.
What a beautiful picture of what a
worship should look like.
How can we be united in worship when we
won't even talk to each other and we
avoid eye contact with each other?
And yet, and we just read how our God is
willing to humble himself
until we reconcile our relationship
with one another.
Can we think of a greater example of
humility and submission than God's
example of waiting on us to reconcile?
Maybe we should be asking ourselves,
if this is the value our heavenly father
places on our earthly relationships,
maybe we should place more value on them
ourselves.
Do we remember how Paul pleaded with the
Ephesians in his letter in Ephesians 4
1-6 when he wrote, "I therefore, the
prisoner of the Lord, beseech you to
walk worthy of the calling of which you
were called, with all loneliness and
gentleness, with longsuffering, bearing
with one another in love, endeavoring to
keep the unity of the spirit in the bond
of peace. There is one body and one
spirit just as you were called in one
hope of your calling. One Lord, one
faith, one baptism, one God and God and
father of all who is above all, through
all and in you all.
Brothers and sisters, if you know you
have an issue between yourself and
another Christian,
go to them in humility and love and get
it worked out. Get it worked out
tonight. Do not wait.
How long has God been waiting for you to
reconcile with your brother or sister so
you can come back and worship him? Did
you hear that?
How long has God been waiting on you to
reconcile with your brother or sister so
you can worship God?
I hope that hurt hits some hearts.
Listen to Colossians 3:12-15.
Listen for the pride in this scripture.
Listen to the Listen to the pride in
this scripture. Therefore, as the elect
of God, the church, holy and beloved,
put on tender mercies, kindness,
humility, meekness, longsuffering,
bearing with one another, and forgiving
one another. If anyone has a complaint
against another, even as Jesus forgave
you, so you must do also.
But above all these things, put on love,
which is the bond of perfection. And let
the peace of God rule in your hearts to
which also you were called in one body,
and be thankful. You pick up on the
pride. I've been reading that thing for
a week. There's no pride in that.
Beloved, put on tender mercies,
kindness, humility, meekness,
longsuffering,
bearing one one another, and forgiving
one another. If anyone has a complaint
against another, even as Christ forgave
you, so you also must do. But above all
things, put on love, which is the bond
of perfection, and let the peace of God
rule over your hearts, to which you were
called in one body, and be thankful.
I'm going to keep reading it. Maybe
someday I'll find pride in there. So
far, I haven't.
So, we might as well move on since I
can't find pride in there. Anybody find
pride in there? Anybody find pride in
there? Yeah. Me either.
One reason God is willing to wait on us
to worship him is because he there is
nothing more important than the unity of
his church,
the body of his son.
He stresses that even feeling angry
towards your brother or sister can lead
to judgment.
Don't you think this stresses the
importance of our unsolved unresolved
anger and potential harm to an
individual holding on to it or our
relationships to our our own
relationships? Ephesians 4:26-27
further underscores the need to address
anger promptly,
preventing it from festering and giving
the devil a foothold in one's life. It
says, "Be angry and do not sin. Do not
let the sun go down on your anger and
give no opportunity to the devil."
In Luke 17:1 and2, Jesus adds to the
seriousness of causing a brother to sin
when he said, "It is impossible that no
offense should come, but woe to him
through whom they do come. It would be
better if for him if a millstone were
hung around his neck and if he were
thrown into the sea then then he should
offend one of these little ones.
Being on either side of a situation like
this is a hard thing.
There are times when we want to tell our
fellow Christians that they've hurt us,
but then our pride gets us all bowed up
and we try to exert our will or control
the situation and we just don't do it.
Then there's other times we try to
control the situation by playing some
sort of victim by setting the
expectation that reconciliation must
come
from one side and one side only. And
guess what? That side's not my side.
Can we see how playing the victim is
just an control strategy?
Let's all understand one thing. Control
strategies are not humility.
These control
tactics are just an infiltr infiltration
of the devil in our hearts.
How often will we say his will be done
and yet not reconcile with our brother
and sister?
If we've been hurt,
we should be ready to accept an apology.
And why would that be? What would our
motivation be to accept an apology?
Because we love each other.
When we love someone, don't we miss
them?
Shouldn't we want what God wants? He
wants the unity of his body, of his
church.
And God gave everything to have a united
church.
And God gave us everything in his son.
And we won't even accept an apology.
Seriously, we won't even take an
apology. We don't even want to do it. We
won't offer an apology. We won't take an
apology.
What's that about?
Not about love.
We need to move on to the second
situation.
Second situation from the perspective of
one who's been sinned against.
So let's turn to Matthew 18:15-17.
says, "Moreover, if your brother sins
against you, go and tell him his faults
between you and him alone. If he hears
you, you have gained a brother. But if
he will not hear, take with you two or
one or two that have that by the mouth
of two or three witnesses, every word
may be established."
And if he refuses to hear them, tell it
to the church. But if he refuses even to
hear the hear the church, let him be
like a heathen and a tax collector.
I had a brother come to me once
and tell me that uh he had something
against me. We sat down and discussed it
and resolved it.
He gained a brother
and so did I.
As we read further, there are additional
steps that can be taken if two of you
don't get things worked out.
The only the only additional caution I
would suggest is if you need to go to
the second step, only take folks that
you can be tr that can be trusted to
keep a confidence
just the same way that you have kept the
whole situation confidential yourself.
The last thing we need, the last thing
any church needs is an issue between two
Christians turning into church gossip.
Right?
With either situation, there has to be a
measure of humility and love displayed
towards our brother and sister for the
sake of our personal relationship, for
unity of the church.
One thing we do not do in either
situation is go around telling our
friends about what sister so and so did
or said so they go spread the
information to an even even wider
audience.
And nowadays this is also needs to
include mysterious Facebook posts to get
brothers and sisters riled up or
uncomfortable wondering what's going on
and what's causing strife.
Just to be clear, this is the definition
of gossip.
Gossip creates discord within the
church.
Discord is division, strife,
disunityity, or conflict.
There are not many things that the Bible
shares with us that God hates. Hates.
But someone who creates discord in the
church is one of them.
This can be found in Proverbs 6:16-19
where it reads, "Six things the Lord
hates. Yes, seven are an abomination to
him. A proud look, a lying tongue, hands
that shed innocent blood, a heart that
devises wicked plans, feet that are
swift to run uh and running to evil, a
false witness uh false witness who
speaks lies, and one who sws sws discord
among brethren.
So there's a diff couple different
categories we need to be aware of as we
talk about this topic of being sinned
against.
If the sin has been committed against
you personally
and if the sin has been committed
against the church,
if you're dealing with the first just a
personal affront to you, then you can
forgive it, have a conversation, move
on. But if you do, you have entered the
no grudge zone.
You can't you've got to forgive and
treat them just like you have forgiven
them. You can't hold a grudge. You can't
treat them differently.
George Lois said, "Not forgiving someone
is like drinking poison and hoping the
offender will get sick."
Now, if you're dealing with the second,
a sin against the church, you've got a
whole different set of circumstances to
deal with. For that, we need to go to
Ezekiel 3:17-21,
which talks about the the
responsibilities of a watchman.
And this is scary.
Oh son of man, I have made you a
watchman for the house of Israel.
Therefore, hear a word from my mouth and
give them warning. give them warning
from me. When I say to the wicked, you
shall surely die and you give them no
warning
nor speak of to warn the wicked from his
wicked ways to save his life,
that same wicked man shall die in his
iniquity. But his blood I will require
at your hand. Yet
if you warn the wicked and he does not
turn from his wicked ways, nor from his
um from his wicked ways, he shall die in
his iniquity, but you have delivered
your own soul.
Again, when a righteous man turns from
his righteousness and commits in
iniquity
and I lay a stumbling block before him,
he shall die because you did not give
him a warning. He shall die in his sin,
and his righteousness which he has done
shall not be remembered, but his blood I
will require at your hand. Nevertheless,
if you warn the righteous man that the
righteousness should not that the
righteous should not sin and he does not
sin, he shall surely live because he
took warning. Also, you have delivered
your soul.
So if you see something, huh? If you see
something, say something, right?
Because you're saving their soul
possibly,
but you're saving your own soul.
So, if you know somebody
within the church
that's living together that aren't
married,
it's on you to say something.
If you don't,
it's on you.
It's on them.
If you say something and they don't do
anything about it, you're clear.
It's on them.
The question is, do we love our brothers
and sisters the way God would have us to
love them? Do we love them enough to
save their souls?
Here's a question. How does it feel to
be a watchman?
Like I said, I've gone through
reconciliation process uh a time or two
and um I've put down some things. Uh Lou
and I went through some uh a school
maybe a year ago um that helped us do
some mediation courses and uh I took
some things away from that and that
helped me. Um but um here's some things,
some tips that if you do have to um
reconcile with your brother or sister,
um hopefully these things will help you
to to make that happen.
Number one, pray about it. That's where
you got to start. You got to start with
prayer. You got to start with praying
for you. You got to start with praying
for them.
Second, reach out. You got to reach out
to them. Nothing's going to happen
unless you talk to them. Okay, so here's
some rules about reaching out. No
texting,
no email.
It's got to be verbal.
You got a phone call's okay, not the
best, but finding them and having a
personal conversation is the best.
Explain why you want to have a have a
meeting.
Explain the why.
Um, you want to set up a meeting uh
location, date, time. I like meeting at
restaurants. Uh, I like having food.
Food brings down walls. Uh, gives me
something to do with my hands when I'm
when I'm not talking or whatever. It
gives me something to do. Um, number
three, have a plan.
Uh, I write mine down. I write it in
here. Um,
if you have multiple issues, write every
issue down. Write it down. Um, write
exactly what you want to say and exactly
the way you want to say it.
Uh, do this prior to the meeting. It
gives you time to reflect on on what
you're talking about, what happened,
what the issue is. Really reflect on
what your problem is. It gives you time
to take any kind of anger out of the
conversation if there is any anger.
Uh, on the day of the meeting, show up
early. I I say 15 minutes or better.
Show up early. That way you can greet
them. You want to greet them at the
meeting.
Um first thing you want to do is explain
clearly again why you wanted to meet.
You wanted to meet so you can reconcile
as a brother or sister or whatever the
situation is. Explaining the why again
to them.
Um don't be afraid to say because God
wants it because he does. Don't be
afraid to say, "Because I love you." Say
it out loud. Use the word love. Don't be
afraid. We love each other, right? We
all love each other.
Say, "I love you."
Say the words, "I miss you. I miss our
our relationship. That's why you're
getting together. I miss our
relationship. I love you." Say those
things. Say them out loud. Don't be
afraid.
Then review every point you had you've
you've put down. Just review it. The
first one, review it. Let them respond.
While they're responding, listen.
And listen without
working up your reply.
Listen without your response in mind.
You may find out that the situation
isn't exactly what you thought it was
because now you're listening to each
other.
Okay, this one's going to be hard. Be
brutally honest.
This does not mean be mean.
Americans tend to think being honest is
mean and I'm going to hurt your feelings
if I'm honest. Guess what? We already
are dealing with hurt feelings because
we're me we're having a meeting about
reconciliation.
We already have hurt feelings,
but be honest.
I'm wanting to meet with you because you
did this or you said that,
 whatever.
 But
did this or you said that,
 whatever.
 But
did this or you said that,
 whatever.
 But
be truthful. Be honest. But doesn't have
to say mean. Don't have to be mean. Just
honest.
Be ready because the beginning of the
conversation is going to be awkward.
It's going to be awkward because it's
going to have to get started. Kind of
like the beginning of this sermon. It
was very awkward and probably still is
for y'all.
Agreeing to disagree is not a solution.
That is not a solution. That is a
copout.
Oh, we just we just won't talk about
this anymore. That's not a solution.
That's that is a chicken copout.
If you don't want to solve a problem,
just agree to disagree. You got to sort
it out.
Wrap up the meeting with a prayer
together.
You called the meeting, you say the
prayer,
and say what's on your heart. If it's
good stuff, say good stuff. If it's bad
stuff, it's bad stuff. But say what's in
your heart, good or bad.
Okay, I know I've learned a lot at you
tonight. I hope something touched
somebody's heart. I don't know. I know
it's been a a work for me to get through
this myself.
I appreciate those people, those
brothers that have uh reconciled with me
over the past few months. Um really put
this on my heart.
Um so let me leave you with this.
God knew even before creation that we
would struggle with submission.
God knew we would struggle at times even
with each other. Right?
Yet God still gave his only begotten son
for the sake of us, the folks that
commit the sins in Galatians 5 19-21,
list one, so that we can be reconciled
back to him and with each other.
So here's the thing. If you're hurting
because you're not reconciled with your
brother or sister
and you need to get that started, that
process started and you need help,
I will volunteer to help.
Whatever you need, I'm here for you.
It's important. It's affecting your
worship. If your heart is so hardened
because it's gone on so long that you
don't realize that it's you can't
worship God until you get this stuff
reconciled.
You got to get it taken care of. You got
to get it taken care of because love
each other and we've got to be able to
express that openly with each other. And
if we don't do it in here, the people
from out there that come in here will
smell blood in the water.
And they won't want anything to do with
us because they can have that anywhere.
Anywhere can back bites. Anywhere can
stab back, you know, backstab anybody.
But we love each other. We talk about
each other in a different way and we
treat each other in a different way.
We're always there to help each other.
So if you need help, I'm here for you.
I'm sure other elders would say the
same. Slides rising.
