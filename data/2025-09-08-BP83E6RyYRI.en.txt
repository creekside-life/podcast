Now submission
always
has a mission and ultimately it is to
seek and to speak up for the king and
the kingdom.
But man struggles with submission.
It's a constant thing. It isn't the
world struggles with submission.
man struggles with submission.
A poll taken a few years ago
asked both men and women, should wives
submit to their husbands?
And that's almost taboo now. You're
almost not supposed to talk about that.
Now,
in 1998, Southern Baptists uh sparked a
pretty big controversy with a statement
that they came out with that um wives
should quote submit graciously
to the servant leadership of their
husband. And so, at that time, it was
publicly asked in polls,
um what do you think of that statement?
69% of those
asked publicly
disagreed with it.
There's so much misunderstanding of
submission
and it clearly has got a bad rap
because it's essential.
It's not essential that women learn
submission.
It's essential that we all learn
submission.
That's the key. Dr. Larry Payton, who's
both a minister and he worked for Tyson
Foods as a chaplain, he was writing an
article and I thought this was
interesting. It was about Ephesians
5:22- 24. And he wrote this starting
with verse 22 of Ephesians 5. You know
that passage. Wives submit to your own
husbands as to the Lord. For the husband
is the head of the wife, as also Christ
is head of the church, and he is the
savior of the body. Verse 24, therefore,
just as the church is subject to Christ,
so let the wives be their own husbands
in everything. And then he continued, it
means to follow your husband as he
follows Christ.
intended to bless and protect the wife,
not to enslave her. It does not mean
that she is without voice and
decisionmaking.
And it's never to be used by the man by
force.
That's not enough for some because some
don't want anybody to tell anybody what
to do.
Many Americans, many Christian Americans
now
believe that they can achieve Christ's
kingdom on earth through political
means. I'm probably going to offend
everybody in the room here in the next
few moments, so listen closely to what
I'm fixing to say.
They feel the need to dominate the
culture.
Which side of the political spectrum am
I talking to? Both.
So, if you are political at all, I'm
talking to you.
I'm not talking to some of you. I'm
talking to all of you, including myself.
You need to hear me.
Brian Xand
of Word of Life Church in St. Joseph,
Missouri, wrote this. Found this
interesting and it relates to what I'm
saying. I'm not going to take a minute,
then we get over into the real lesson
here.
Christianity is inherently
countercultural.
That's how it thrives.
You hear it.
When it tries to become a dominant
culture, it becomes corrupted.
I mean, that's true in history. If you
really studied history, you know it's
true.
This is one major difference between
Islam and Christianity.
Islam has designs on running the world.
It's a system of government.
Christianity is nothing like that.
The Gospels and the Epistles have no
vision of Christianity being a dominant
religion or culture.
You can't find it. Let me go back to
quoting him now. that the kingdom of God
isn't tangible for many Christians. He
goes on to say, "What's real is this
todry world of partisan politics, this
winner take all blood sport." So they
keep charging into the fray and the
temptation to bow down to the devil to
gain control over the kingdoms of this
world becomes more and more
irresistible.
that he is offended by what the American
church has become and that God does not
tolerate idols competing for his glory
and neither should anyone who claims to
worship him.
You can take up the sword of Caesar or
you can take up the cross of Jesus but
you have to choose.
I'm not through. Tim Alberta in his 2023
book, The Kingdom, The Power, and the
Glory: American Evangelicals in an Age
of Extremism, wrote this. The Bible is
written primarily from the perspective
of the underdog.
Hebrew slaves fleeing Egypt, Jews exiled
to Babylon, Christians living under
Roman occupation.
This is why Paul implored his fellow
Christian c first century Christian
believers, especially those in Rome who
lived under a brutal regime to both
submit to their governing authorities
and stay loyal to the kingdom built by
Christ.
It stands to reason that American
evangelicals can quite relate to Paul
can't quite relate to Paul and his plea
for humility or Peter and his enthusiasm
for suffering. Never mind that poor
vagrant preacher from Nazareth. The last
shall be first. What kind of socialistic
indoctrination is that?
What am I talking about? I've got a
sermon coming. It's not ready yet. I'm
working on it.
I don't know where it's going right now
quite honestly,
but everybody wants to be on one side or
the other.
And that would probably be enough,
but everybody thinks 100% their side is
right. Now, I don't care what
perspective you're in right now. You
believe that or you wouldn't be where
you are. I don't care if you're far left
or you're far right or you're a little
bit left or you're a little bit right or
you think you're dead center. You
probably aren't dead center. You
probably lean one way or the other. You
think where you are is right and so much
so that you think the others are wrong
and are in danger of potentially being
in trouble with God.
So, I'm going to be speaking future on
deconstructing faith. It's a new term.
You'll understand it when I get there.
But it's the idea
of political
obesence
almost to the point of we're idolatizing
politics.
Let me ask you a question. I asked my
wife this question this week. Would you
know it if the kingdom was already here
in its fullness?
Would
you even be able to recognize it?
We're so focused on what we think it's
got to be.
So, there's those who are
against the government and they're
certain that's right. There's those who
are for the government. I'm talking
about what we got right now. And they're
certain that's right.
And so much so that you got to be
careful what you say. Have you noticed
that
I'm talking about among Christians, you
got to be careful what you say? Cuz
you'll be thought to be a heathen nearly
by your brother.
You don't think that's a problem?
You don't live where I live.
Both political extremes. You listen to
me now. You don't want to hear this. I
know you don't want to hear this. Both
political
groups are extremists
and both are proud
and both look down on the other
and both justify their side and now it's
at the point that both are willing to
justify a little violence to get what
they want.
You need to hear what I'm saying because
I know some of you are both directions.
We got a church here. We got folks over
here and we got folks over here. And if
you don't believe that, you don't know
what what you're worshiping with. Okay?
You need to know what you're worshiping
with.
And so you think everybody's wherever
you are. That's not true in this room.
But that's not the problem I have is
thinking that force is what we need to
do.
So I'm on a lesson about submission.
which is a little different than force.
You hear me?
We need to learn how to submit.
We don't have to be the boss.
Do you hear that? You don't have to be
on the side that wins.
You certainly think you do. And some of
you sitting here thinking, "What is Rex
trying to teach?" You're the one I'm
talking to.
You need to hear me. You need to chill
out a little bit
because you don't know all you think you
know. The Lord God is in control.
I think he's still king.
And I think we're trying to be in his
kingdom, not this one. Listen to some
scriptures. Sec 1st Samuel 2:1 16. Why
was Hoffnei and Phineas condemned?
Because of this thing, you must give it
now. And if you don't, I will take it by
force.
There's no place for force and religious
convictions.
That's what went wrong with Catholicism.
Think about it.
You start thinking you got a right to
push it that hard.
Matthew 11:12, the kingdom of heaven
suffers violence and the violent take it
by force. It is a tendency. If you're
not careful, you will justify violence
for your your political convictions.
And Roman John 6 and verse 15, they were
about to take him by force to make him
king. You imagine that they were going
to take Jesus and make him the king.
How about this one? Mark chapter
10:42-43.
those who are considered rulers over the
Gentiles lorded over them, and their
great ones exercise authority over them.
Yet it shall not be so among you. But
whoever desires to become great among
you shall be your servant. We're talking
about elders.
We don't need bosses. We need servants.
Matthew 5:5, "Blessed are the meek, for
they shall inherit the earth." And
William Barkley said this, and I think
it's really great. It says, "Prow,"
which is the word for meek, means far
more than the English word meek now
means. Perhaps the word gentle comes
nearest to it. The full translation must
read, "Oh, the ble bliss of the man who
is always angry at the right time and
never angry at the wrong time." Boy, if
you can pull that one off, you're great.
who has ever uh every instinct and
impulse and passion under control
because he is God controlled who has the
humility to realize his own ignorance
and his own weakness.
Do you see it?
You see, if you see your own weakness
and your own ignorance, if you can admit
it,
then you know you don't know what should
be done.
John 18:36,
"My kingdom is not of this world. If my
kingdom were of this world, my servants
would fight
so that I should not be delivered to the
Jews. But now my kingdom is not from
here.
This
is the kingdom,
not that out there.
I know that's going to go down wrong for
those of you who are really thumping
your political chest regularly.
But you need to hear me because I'm
talking about submission tonight and see
there's a mission in submission.
We're going to look at the first one for
the first side and then we're going to
flip it over just for a moment. I want
you to see the flip side of it. Okay.
First thing
a mission of submission to leaders is to
help them teach us. So we need to submit
for us
not for them
for us. Listen to what it says. Remember
those who rule over you who have spoken
the word of God to you.
Our leaders are going to teach us.
That's what they're there for. Whose
faith follow. Listen to their faith, how
they live, considering the outcome of
their conduct. Jesus Christ is the same
yesterday, today, and forever. He hasn't
changed. Do not be carried about with
various and strange doctrines. Don't
leave the faith. For it is good that the
heart be established by grace, not with
foods which have no profit profit that
those who have been occupied with them.
So,
we have to learn to submit to being
taught. It's a lot easier. Listen, it's
a lot easier to teach than it is to be
taught.
What you're doing right now is the
harder part of this
cuz it's a lot easier to sit there and
just pick apart everything I'm saying.
That's nothing. Doesn't take a brain.
You can any child can ask a question
that an adult can't answer.
Just because you can ask a question or
pick something apart doesn't mean you
know anything.
Doesn't take a brain to do that. We act
like that. Well, I ask a question he
couldn't answer. Big deal. We all can do
it without thinking.
But learning
and that's what we need leaders for.
That's why we need them.
Number two,
a mission of submission to leaders is to
help them serve us.
We submit to them, but they serve us.
Listen to how it plates it. It's talking
about the Jewish system, but it has a
tone over what he's just been talking
about the church. In verse 10, we have
an altar from which those who serve the
tabernacle or the tent have no right to
eat. For the bodies of those animals
whose blood is brought into the
sanctuary by the high priest for sin are
burned outside the camp. I'll tell you
something that you had to quit that when
by the time you're 55 cuz chucking
around those big cows and calves and it
was a hard job. You can have a heart
attack right there in the temple. Verse
12. But they serve the people. I mean
they burn sacrifices every day.
Therefore Jesus also that he might
sanctify the people with his own blood.
He served us. Suffering outside the
gate. Again, leadership serves. The Old
Testament leaders served. Jesus served.
Therefore, let us go forth to him
outside the camp, bearing his reproach.
For here we have no continuing city. But
we seek the one to come. Therefore, by
him, let us continually offer the
sacrifice.
We serve. They serve. We serve. That is
the fruit of our lips. Giving thanks to
his name. But do not forget to do good
and to share for which such sacrifices
God is well pleased.
We have to learn not just to submit to
being taught.
We have to learn to submit to being
helped.
There's a lot of pride in this world.
You may be one we're bringing food to.
Someday you may be the one we're
bringing clothes to.
But for sure, you're being served every
Sunday by our leaders and every week by
our leaders. They're serving you.
You have to learn to submit to it and
allow it and not think, "I'm not going
to let anybody do that for me."
No,
you got to be humble enough to let that
happen. There's a mission in you doing
that.
I'll get to that in just a second.
Number three, a mission of submission to
leaders is to help them watch us.
We're not watching them. So, though
sometimes people think that's their job
is to watch those elders, make sure they
do the right thing. Well, okay, that's
fine. You can do that. It's a waste of
time most of the time, but you could
try. Hebrews chap 13 17-19 says this.
Obey those who rule over you and be
submissive
for they watch out for your souls
as those who must give an account. They
This is special
burden. It's a burden on them. I know
some of y'all think this is a position
of authority and power. This is a
burden.
Let them do so with joy and not with
grief for that would be unprofitable for
you. Most of the time it's with grief.
You ask an elder. You get an elder who
really talked to you.
It's not a lot of fun.
Ain't much fun in this.
It's mainly grief because they know too
many sad stories that y'all never even
hear about.
Verse 18, pray for us, for we are
confident that we have a good conscience
in all things, desiring to live
honorably, but I especially urge you to
do this that I may be restored to you
the sooner I I just want to be serving
you. But he wanted to watch after them.
That's the whole point. And submitting
to being watched after. You know, when
you're a kid, you were watched after.
You didn't know it. So many people in
the church don't know they're being
watched after.
don't even realize it.
In other words, it's kind of like this.
If you don't hear the tree fall in the
forest, did it actually make a sound?
If you didn't see it, did it actually
happen?
In other words, if you in in your genius
thinking
don't not aware of what they're doing
for you, then it's not real.
You can't know it all.
There's no way for you. If you were told
it would ruin this church, if every week
we nobody would come here. If every week
the elders got up here and told you what
they were dealing with, half the people
would leave because they don't want
their story told next week.
You can't do that. So, we don't get a
report on the benevolence. That's right.
And we're not going to report on who got
what this week. That's right. Well, we
don't get a report on who you went to
see this week. That's right. We're not
going to tell you what who we saw this
last week.
Well, how are we going to know you doing
your work? Well, it's just like
children. Do children know what their
mom and dad are doing? And when a child
walks over and flips the switch, they
go, "Boy, mom and dad really stole out
the money.
They paid the power bill.
They don't think like that.
But you need to recognize as a child as
you grow up and as you get a little more
mature that it was being taken care of
or don't you? At some point you go, "Hm,
my mom and dad fed me. Hm. My mom and
dad had water. H my mom and dad left the
electricity on. My mom and dad puts gas
in a car. H right? You begin to learn
that which is going to bring me to my
next point. But let's do a summary of
what we looked at so far. Here's
basically it. The mission in submission
to church uh to church leaders is the
mission of submission is they teach us,
they serve us, and then they watch us.
That's what they do for us. That's why
we should submit to them, right? That's
why we should submit to them.
I'll get to the second message in just a
moment. John Calvin said this. You must
submit to supreme suffering in order to
discover the completion of joy.
If that doesn't sound true to you, then
you're not there yet.
Leadership requires you kind of going
there.
Charles Haden Spurgeon said this. I
think a better thing than thanksgiving
is thanksgiving.
How is this to be done? By general
cheerfulness.
By an obedience to the command of him by
whom mercy we live. By a perpetual
constant delighting of ourselves in the
Lord and by a submission of our desires
to his will. You can't be a Christian
if you don't agree to obey. You can't be
a Christian if you don't agree to
submit. You can't be saved if you don't
give yourself to submission. Submission
is expectancy without expectations.
I don't have to get what I want. Well,
God didn't give me my so and so died. My
my I I got sick. Oh, I I don't I'm not
going to follow a God like that. No,
it's expectancy. God is working for me,
but I can't have expectations. That's
submission.
Submission is surrendering to who's in
charge without challenging their wisdom
at every turn.
If you think you're smarter than five
elders, you're smarter than I know of
anybody I've ever met.
Nobody's that smart.
Ryan Larson
has a story in the Associated Press from
February 22nd, 2008. Y'all like seat
belts? Y'all remember when we didn't
have seat belts? Y'all remember how many
you remember that? How many remember?
Look at that. Kids, y'all know y'all
never seen that day, have you? So, once
upon a time, we didn't have seat belts
and most of the time we survived.
But this one guy saw it as a real
hassle. And most of you probably don't
particularly care for them sometimes
either. It's probably best though on
vinyl seats when there's just a bench up
front.
Do y'all remember going too fast around
the corner and almost being in the
middle of the car? Okay, so that that's
one of the things. So vinyl seats kind
of Anyway, buckle up is the right thing,
right? It's the right thing to do. Amen.
It is the law, right? Amen. Submission
to the government. Back to that point
earlier. Uh, law requires that we buckle
up and uh, alarms go off now. Well,
Associated Press, there's a New
Zealander named Ivan Seigodan, I think
is the way you say it. It's up there.
Uh,
and the police ticketed him 32
times
over five years. He refused. And they
knew it. They knew he wasn't going to be
wearing it. So he just started there he
is pull him over because you could see
you know they can see in your car right
they can see whether the straps on your
shoulder or not. Well he figured that
out. So he he was so against seat belts
he created a strap in his car that tied
to where the strap was and dropped over
your shoulder so from the back it looked
like he had the strap on. He didn't have
the strap on, but he was not he was not
going to submit to that crazy rule that
you have to wear a seat belt. I'm a free
man. I'm going to do what I want to do.
Right? And he had that right across him,
which was great. Wasn't getting tickets.
They were leaving him alone. It looked
great until he had a head-on collision.
It threw him forward into the steering
wheel and killed him instantly.
The coroner described the fake seat belt
this way. Though his car was fitted with
seat belts, an extra belt with a long
strap had been knotted above the seat
belt on the driver's side providing a
belt to supply to simply excuse me sit
over the do uh driver's shoulder. make
you think it
submission.
Maybe
it's just not a good thing.
Maybe it's essential.
Maybe it's not just that we need to
learn to submit to Christ. But maybe we
don't have a right to proclaim Christ to
the world if we can't learn how to do
it.
Maybe not only does submission need to
be done, but it is the call of obedience
to a cross,
not a kingdom of our own.
Maybe submission is filled with
blessings like wearing a seat belt
where we submit to authority
or church leaders because actually it's
in our best interest because they will
teach us, they will serve us and they
will watch us.
All right, let's see this flip side.
Okay, here's flip side. So that's the
mission in submission, right? is that we
need to learn to submit and not think
that we don't have to submit to anybody,
right? Because it's actually in our best
interest. Seat belts aren't terrible.
May be irritating.
They're not terrible.
Helmet maybe if you ride on a
motorcycle.
Stopping at red lights, right? Or stop
signs, yield signs, yield.
driving in one lane at a time. I almost
drove in two yesterday and almost had a
wreck. So, it's not a good idea.
What's the second side of this?
Submission isn't just about learning to
submit to those who are over you.
It's about learning to be those that are
over others.
You see, if you can't learn to submit,
how's anybody going to ever submit to
you?
At some point in your growth process,
we need to listen to you.
You need to teach us.
At some point in your growth process,
we need you to serve us.
We don't just need you to be a a vacuum
cleaner.
We need you to go there, young people.
We need you to go there. We won't have a
church if you don't go there. We need
you to become the person that watches
after all the rest of us.
That's the second mission in submission.
Because the mission is to teach you how
to do it yourself and see what it feels
like on the other side. It's not as much
fun as you might think.
Might not be as much fun. But maybe
submission is actually the only path
because if you're not willing to submit,
then I guess you won't repent of your
sins.
You won't confess the Lord Jesus. You
won't be baptized.
You won't live the Christian life. You
won't surrender to the will because you
won't submit. Submission is a a message
because it is a mission. So you may not
like the subject and if you're a lady
today and you may think there's no
message in that, but I want to tell you
something. There's a great message in
every woman that submits to their
husband. There is a great message in
every teenager that submits to their
parents. There is a great message in
every child that submits to their
parents. There's a great message in
every church that submits to their
leaders. There's a great message in
every church that submits to its country
without thinking we're going to fix it.
We need to pray for them.
Be careful what you say about it. Either
side. Either side. Be careful because
you're sending the wrong message. You
don't have the answers. We serve the one
that does.
Submit to him. If you're here tonight
and you haven't given your life to the
Lord Jesus, want to give you that
opportunity. Hope offended you too much.
Would love to see you come forward if
you need to. Why don't you do that while
we stand and while we
