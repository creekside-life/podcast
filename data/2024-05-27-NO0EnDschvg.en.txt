Abigail is probably the closest biblical
person in the scriptures to the idea of
substitutionary atonement we'll talk
more about that nabal is probably one of
the closest biblical personalities to
emulate modern
narcissism which is a terrible blight on
our world why did The Narcissist cross
the
road he thought it was your
boundary that's not funny is
it so want to look at preventive Grace
or preceding Grace in theolog in
theology it refers to the grace of God
in life which
predes and prepares us all for
conversion Augustine talked about it a
long long time ago when he says the form
of an effectual calling leading
individuals to Salvation armenius which
most of you are probably Armenians I
don't know if I am but you probably are
uh dispense to enable people to respond
to the offer of Salvation Spurgeon said
it this way God sends this grace to
prevent saints and sinners from running
into sin those are all part of it
there's more to it than
that all Christians have experienced
more grace than we need that's right
there's enough Grace for you that you've
already received more grace than you
need to be saved 1 Peter 4:10 talks
about the manifold grace of God which
means The multi-layer Graces is like an
onion every time you peel it away
another layer appears right below it
there are various forms there's God's
preventive Grace which is keeping us
back from sins that would consume men
that's a critical concept and you need
to understand it a little more hopefully
by the end of this you will God's
perceiving grace is shows us the hate
and the sorrow and the pain of sin that
makes us want to turn away from it and
then then there's God's pardoning grace
which gives us the power to believe in
Jesus and be forgiven by his atoning
sacrifice but that's only the
beginning in what ways did we see this
grace in our life before our conversion
I'm going to use an illustration that's
probably
oversimplified so if you don't get this
I don't know how to explain it so these
are my work gloves I washed them
especially for today so they don't smell
too
bad the reason that I wear work gloves
it's because I want to have pretty hands
you know and if you work in the yard you
probably or work outside with Lumber or
you going to move some concrete blocks
it's not a bad idea cuz I've got scars
in this and this is my third pair that
I've worn out so the grace of God
there's a form of the grace of God who
acts like my work
gloves the purpose of it is to prevent
my hand from getting chewed all to
pieces where it's useless right that's
why I put it on that's the grace of God
that appears to us before our conversion
there are many examples of that I've
given you four up there it's the grace
of Godly education and any form of Godly
education that you might have received
how very small it might have been was a
way of preventing you from getting into
some things that you would have gotten
into it's the things that kept you from
maybe some blasphemies that you would
have committed or some drunkenness or
some behavior that you would have gotten
into you might not have gotten out of it
was expensed To You by The Blessed holy
mother you may have had or affectionate
father who taught you the right things
and raised you appropriately who prayed
for your soul that's that Godly advice
that they gave you like Lois and Eunice
did for Timothy that helped you
immensely in your life and protected you
on the inside from so many things it's
the grace of Godly associations that you
had that is 1 Corinthians 15:33 we know
that evil companions can corrupt good
morals if you had good friends not all
of us had good friends if you had good
Godly friends people who went to church
who tried to do the right thing and they
encouraged you to do the right thing and
you grew up around people that actually
kind of kept you protected in the
environment you were in those
associations that may have prevented us
from indulging in some sins that would
have under other circumstances literally
have plunged us into such deep sin we
might not have come out of then there's
that Grace of Godly Providence Romans
8:28 that all things work together for
good to those who are called according
to his purpose well there are
temptations that maybe are Temptations
to you but because of some protection
when you were tempted you weren't able
and when at other times when you were
tempted you had no desire and so those
times when by the Providence of God you
you stayed away from some things and
then there's the grace of Godly
preachers and teachers who taught you in
Hebrews 13:7 where you maybe you were
going to church didn't really mean
anything to you but you were being
protected by people teaching things
around you that helped you stay a little
closer to the straight and era had you
not had any of that influence into your
life that's when the
glove is protecting you it literally
kept help you from ending up with a
cut or a scar that you could not get
over and you never would have been but I
want you to see these gloves in a little
different way now put one over here one
over here so y'all can see them they're
real
gloves now if I say to these gloves get
up and go do
work they're not
lisening they don't have the power to
get up and go do work work they really
don't there's another type of Grace that
can be seen in these gloves and that's
the grace that comes into our life after
our conversion you see the truth is is
that without the grace of God you don't
even have the power to be a
Christian you can't even function if
you're struggling today to live the
Christian Life it's likely because
you're like that glove you don't have
the power to be the Christian you need
you see that's that Grace of Godly
churches that help us because Christ is
in that church and the truth is being
tested regularly it's the grace of Godly
calamities believe it or not some of the
best things have ever happened to you
was the fact that you nearly died from
something that you got sick and weren't
able to participate in some of the
things you would have participated in
it's the grace of Godly consciences that
help you and spared you from some habits
since you become a Christian whereas
it's like the eldest leaving and it
influenced the youngest to leave when
they all picked up rocks to Stone that
woman it is that other influence and
it's that Grace of Godly countries
believe it or not where it not for the
good restraint that God has placed upon
this country you can't imagine how bad
this country could
be it has been the thing that has saved
this country oh I know modern society
just detest the restrictions that have
been influenced by Christ onto our
culture and our laws but it is that that
saved you and this country and so
literally though without something we
become like these
gloves there's something that gives us
the power and it's the
grace of Christ in
US it turns nothing but a piece of
material into something that can do
something so you want to know how to
live the Christian Life Christ Christ in
you the hope of glory that's it that's
the whole thing those are the two Graces
you might have not understood but it is
so true and it's so real all of our life
both
before and after we're saved I want to
give you three examples in the story of
Abigail of this kind of Grace this
proceeding Grace and more than that I
want to talk to you about
substitutionary atonement because that's
what actually saved you that's in
between the glove before and the glove
after in between is that salvation which
comes through substitutionary atonement
and all of this is in 1 Samuel 25 Now 1
Samuel 25 is not the cross it's not what
saves us forever I'm not trying to
suggest that I'm trying to give you an
example of something that we ought to
see in our daily walk because it
actually happens in this story so the
first one I want you to see
is God's preceding and preventive Grace
that was extended to shephers by
Abigail's substitutionary atonement
that's a mouthful a it so think with me
this whole story if you know the story
is is that David and his men had
protected nabal's Shepherds and their
sheep while they're out in the
wilderness that's how bad this country
was and it's also how bad there were
criminals out there and it tells you
that there were roving Bandits all the
time in a country that's supposed to be
following the Lord it was that evil out
there in the countryside that they
needed an army to protect the Shepherds
and the Sheep that's what they did they
did it naturally that's who they were
they were protecting that was that
protective preceding preventive Grace
that was around them but what's
interesting is in verse 22 when we read
may God do so and more also to the
enemies of David this is David after
nabal dared to not even offer a little
bit of food when he's a very rich man
and they're having this big feast and he
asked would you give us a little bit of
food my men have been doing this Duty
for you would you just give us something
anything would be helpful and he's got
like 400 men out there to 600 men they
got to eat right and he makes a joke
about it and turns him down verse 22 may
God do so and more also to the enemies
of David if I leave one male of all who
belong to him my morning I'm going to
kill him I'm going to kill he everybody
in his household I'm going to kill every
one of those Shepherds I'm going to put
them all to
death let me tell you something
somebody's had your name on their list
at some
point somebody wanted to do you in
somebody wanted to hurt you somebody's
tried
somebody has
tried somebody might have succeeded a
time or two but the fact that they
didn't succeed every time is this Grace
we're talking about here the Shepherds
were kep
alive by
Abigail now Abigail wasn't present when
David's men
came abigael didn't see any of this she
heard it later from some of the shepherd
boys that told them what had happened
she hears this and she intervenes it is
Abigail that saves all the men's lives
including Neal it's Abigail and her
offering which brings us to the second
Point God's proceeding and preventive
Grace was extended to nabal by Abal a uh
Abigail's substitutionary atonement and
you really see it in verses 24 and 25
when it says so she fell at his feet
that is at David's feet who had already
put so swords on and were going to kill
them now listen to me David was not
right to want to kill
them make no mistake David was
wrong he should not have thought that
way but how many times have we done that
I'll get you back you dare say that to
me you dare talk that way to me
you think that I'm not going to come
after you right slap me on One Cheek
I'll slap your cheek
off
right he wasn't right but look at verse
24 so she fell at his feet that is
David's feet and said on me my
Lord on
me let this iniquity be that's called
substitutionary atonement kill me not
them take me I bet some of you prayed it
for your children right your child was
sick you didn't know what was going to
happen Lord let it hit me not them I'm
old let me
go we've probably all prayed it haven't
we or at least thought about
it trying to make a deal with the Lord
on me my Lord on me let this iniquity be
and please let your made servants speak
in your ears don't kill me before I have
a chance to speak and hear the words of
your made servant verse 25 please let my
Lord regard not regard this Scandal
nabal don't kill nebal
wow don't kill nabal he's a
fool he's a rich mean old scoundrel fool
that is what the Bible says not what re
St says that's what the Bible says about
now if the Bible calls you a fool you're
a
fool for it as his name
is so is
he nabal is his name and Folly is with
him but I your maid servant did not see
the young man of my Lord whom you s I
didn't
know I didn't know now she's bringing
all this food she made way she had about
four Lambs prepared a bunch of cakes all
kinds of Raisin things she's getting
there and she has it with
her she says I didn't see
it now whether you know this or not she
was the
substitutionary sacrifice for a
fool is there a message in that for you
and me and Christ on the cross
for a fool you calling me a fool brother
doesn't oh I would be too
kind you've been worse than that it's
called
sin you think you didn't do
it you think you haven't sined why do
you think cries out on the cross part
cuz you
burped no you've done
wrong and Neal's life is saved
by
Abigail and this is preceding Grace this
is an opportunity for the Shepherds to
really get right with it's an
opportunity for nabal to get right with
God it's an opportunity that's preceding
Grace number next last Point God's
proceeding and preventive Grace was
extended to David by Abigail's
substitutionary atonement that's right
David needed to be saved from who
from
himself you know that's who you mainly
need to be saved from right have you
thought about it who do you mainly have
as an enemy it's sitting in your chair
that's your biggest
enemy listen to what it says I'll start
in verse 26 as the Lord lives and as
your soul lives since the Lord has
listen to these words the Lord has not
me Abigail's not saying I did
this says as the the Lord has held you
back from coming to
Bloodshed and from avenging yourself
with your own hand now then let your
enemies and those who seek harm from my
Lord be as nabal don't do it verse 31
and this will be no grief to you nor
offense you w years so now go oh I
killed all of the Shepherds and
everybody that was a part of nabal oh
why did I do
that you got stuff like that
right either that you had shed blood
without cause or that my Lord had
Avenged so either way whether you really
they don't really deserve this or you uh
were just about avenging yourself they
might have deserved it by the way some
people deserve you're saying some ugly
things to them but don't avenge yourself
leave it to the Lord amen are you
listening are you listening are you
really hearing me are you just hearing
about the person sitting next to you
listen to me now this is to you and me
okay so not only about not avenging
yourself but not actually harming
someone to the point that I will be
grieved about it later listen to verse
32 then David said to Abigail blessed is
the Lord God of Israel not blessed is
Abigail is this blessed is the Lord God
of Israel who sent you this day to meet
me verse 33 and blessed is your advice
and blessed are you because you have
kept me this day from coming to
Bloodshed I did not harm anybody listen
and from avenging myself with my own
hands something I should never do I
should never do amen amen walls I should
never avenge myself amen walls I should
never ever avenge myself amen all right
verse 34 for indeed the Lord God of
Israel has kept me back from hurting you
Abigail I to killed you
too so this is the lesson
Abigail God's proceeding and preventive
Grace was extended to
Shepherds to nabal and to David because
Abigail offered
herself as a substitutionary
sacrifice God's preceding and preventive
Grace and substitutionary atonement are
real forms of God's manifold Grace
Abigail's substitutionary atonement is
seen in verse 24 so she fell at his feet
and said on me my Lord on me let this
iniquity be we are see Jesus
substitutionary atonement in Isaiah 53
and verse 6 says and we like sheep have
gone astray we have turned everyone to
his own way and the lord has laid on him
the iniquity
of us all 1 Corinthians 5 puts it this
way for he made him who knew no sin to
be sin have you been ever been treated
like the one that was wrong when it was
the other
guy who knew no sin to be sin for us
that we might become the righteousness
God to Bear the brunt of hard things for
another is our highest
calling you can't do anything greater
than that
that's
it that's what you're called to do and
it's what you don't want to
do it's when someone donates an organ
who wants to give up the organ that you
have
really
anybody there's been over a million
donors now the very first one was done
by Dr Joseph Murray and it was Rick or
Ronald herck for his twin brother and
all he did is give up one
kidney he got a Nobel Prize for that the
police officers do it they do it all the
time the military do it the police
officers do it I read of this one Anita
good year was just a uh cop for the
police I mean for the police for the
school and just acting as one of the uh
Middle School in Cecil County Maryland
guides guiding the kids across the
street somebody decided to go even
though she's telling them all to
stop and there's a little girl in the
way and what did she
do she became the substitutionary
sacrifice she went down grabbed the
child threw the child out of the way as
the vehicle hit her now she
survived but she did it without
thinking that's a substitutionary
sacrifice not not the little
one women like Abigail do it all the
time they enter the Valley of Death just
to have a child they risk their lives to
keep their families together Jesus did
it for us all our highest calling in
this world is to be so like Jesus like
we sang a while ago that we would be
willing to be the substitutionary
sacrifice the atonement for the people
around us this is why I can't atone for
their sin no but you can also not
react you cannot do what David was going
to do you can you to do like Abigail in
John 13:15 as I have done to you what
did Jesus do for you he went to the
cross for every one of us right
did he deserve
that what have you done for
anybody he's called you to be like
that but he didn't deserve it I don't
deserve
it I would never do it for a fool like
that
person if you're not willing to do it
for a fool like that person you're not
willing to do it at all because we were
all
fools 1 Peter 2:21 to this we were
called that Christ suffered for us this
is what we were called to Christ
suffered for us leaving us an example
that we should follow in his
steps so you're called a substitutionary
atonement proceeding and preventing
Grace that's our
job so what do we do for the
week we become the glove
so the weak at church who say foolish
things and do foolish things and the
young people we become the glove we try
to
prevent that's the grace we EX
stand for the
fools we try to show them our love to
the point that we will let them hurt our
feelings and hurt
us for
them that's what you're called to
did you know
it did you even know
it it's the highest calling there
is you got a Tippy Toe to touch
it the invitation is God's proceeding
and preventive Grace for The Young and
the
weak and God's substitutionary
atonement for the fool now we'll tell
you
doesn't work very
often oh you thought I was going to tell
you it worked all the time no I'm going
to tell you that it doesn't work very
often Abigail did
this and she didn't tell her husband she
saved his life and all of his men's life
and everything they had she didn't tell
him for a day or two Let It Go oh I'm
afraid he'll get mad he might not like
what I've done I don't know I don't know
I don't know how he'll handle this
so she told
him he did not receive it
well instead of him saying thank you
Abigail thank you for stepping in from
me thank you for helping me which is
what you think people will do you think
they'll rush in here to be
baptized but that's not what fools
Do Fools go
silent what did you do
Abigail who do you think you
are you call yourself a
Christian he went So Silent his heart
died within him about 10 days later he
fell over
dead I'm sorry but all your
substitutionary
atonement may only lead to that
but we're called to it anyway have you
noticed Jesus died for the world and the
world isn't following
him don't forget what you call her
preventive Grace protect the little ones
substitutionary atonement protect the
fools it's your job it's been done for
you will you receive it will you repent
of your sins confess the name of Christ
and be baptized and receive the
substitutionary atonement you've already
received preventive Grace you're here
this
morning want you come if you need to
while we standing while we sing
