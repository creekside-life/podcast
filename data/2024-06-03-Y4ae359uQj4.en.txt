parenting often happens in a noisy
house that's not as
clean often as you'd like it to be the
laundry
expenses schedules piling up on you no
one may be satisfied at this moment you
may feel exhausted you might feel
unappreciated and you just broke up
another fight
parenting can be tough and parents can
get lost in it doing lots of things but
not knowing why they're doing them
parents can get lost in The Daily Grind
and lose what they're actually supposed
to be working
for parents can get lost in the shock of
their kids and the level that they're
able to irritate them and frustrate them
parents can get lost in Endless duties
and not see the overarching vision of
what they're supposed to be about
parents can get lost in Practical
strategies and practical steps from some
latest book you've read on exactly how
to handle kids in some particular
situation which only fits some kids and
don't fit every kid parents need a big
gospel parenting worldview that's what
I'm going to try to give you that will
not only make sense of your task but
will change the way you approach this
whole subject parents need to see the
big picture of who you are as a
parent ownership
parenting seems
right but it's pointed in the wrong
direction ownership parenting is seldom
expressed
but from time to time you'll hear the
operative attitude that suggests it
these children belong to me so I can
parent them in the way I see
fit ownership parenting is on a
trajectory leading away from God's
design that doesn't go down easy
ownership parenting is a subtle shift in
moments that seem insignificant at the
time ownership parenting is what parents
want for and from their
children ownership parenting is what we
want our kids to be and give us in
return ownership parenting seems right
it feels right it does good things but
it is fundamentally misguided and flawed
and will produce
what God does not
intend good parenting which does what
God
intends begins with this radical and
humbling
recognition that our children do not
actually belong to
us God entrusts children as a gift to
stewards not owners
but they belong to him and parents are
his agent to see that his image is
formed in
them you might not realize that that's
your shift in your
thinking but it pretty much is for most
of
us
biblically
parenting is to be like a
steward and that our children are to be
who we are stewarding through this world
we're not to be owners of
them we'd never own our
children Psalm 127:3 says children are a
gift from the Lord that may sound like
it belongs to you job 41:11 everything
under Heaven is mine so they
don't everything on this planet belongs
to
who what here belongs to
you
nothing not even
you nothing belongs to you quit thinking
you own it your house isn't yours your
car isn't yours the money in your pocket
is not yours your husband is not yours
your wife is not yours It ultimately all
belongs to him Ezekiel 18:4 says behold
All Souls are mine the soul of the
father as well as the soul of the son is
mine who does he belong
to God Luke 12:42 therefore who is that
faithful and wise Steward his master
will make ruler over his household so
you will be you're given a household if
you're a good Steward to give them their
portion of food that's what a steward
does takes care of something but doesn't
Own It 1 Corinthians 4 and: 2 says it is
required in stewards that one be found
faithful so that's your
responsibility in the Bible this in in
between position if you will is
therefore called an ambassador an
ambassador let me see if I can sus that
out a little bit so it begins to make a
little more sense because we just read
it a moment ago and then we'll look at
some scriptures on it an ambassador is
to Faithfully represent the message the
methods the character of the leader
who sent you him or her an ambassador is
to be a strong leader a good manager a
resilient negotiator a respected
representative of who sent you an
ambassador is not free to think speak or
act
independently an ambassador in every
action every decision and ever in every
interaction is shaped by this what is
the will and the plan of the one who
sent me it has nothing to do with what
you
want there's the problem an ambassador
is not there to represent his own
interests his own perspectives his own
power that is if he wants to keep his
job as an ambassador he doesn't because
they find out you're out there like a
cowboy and you don't have a job an
ambassador must maintain relationships
and promote policy strategies that are
mutually beneficial to two different
groups parenting is therefore
ambassadorial work from beginning to end
Ambassador parenting is not about what
we want for our kids it's not about what
we want from our kids neither for nor
from from that's not what Ambassador
parenting are about it's not about what
we want for or from our kids but about
what God in His Grace has planned to do
through Us in
them you have a job from the King this
is not your
property so ambassadorial
parenting is pretty
humbling as we are seek to rescue our
children from the power of sin and to
lead them to God's amazing
grace sin makes us all
more natural
owners bosses rather than
ambassadors sin makes us all more
demanding rather than
patient sin makes us all more willing to
punish rather than EX in
grace sin makes us all more judgmental
about the sins particularly of other
people and their weaknesses and their
failes even of our
child's we might be more judgmental of
their sins more than our own that's what
sin does to us sin makes us all more
willing to
take uh the time to talk at you but but
not to listen to
you so ownership parenting versus
ambassadorial parenting and I'm not off
that stump yet so I I want you to I want
you to feel it okay because I think you
haven't gathered it yet takes a minute
for you to absorb what I'm really saying
here let's just talk about identity for
a minute I'm not got to any points of
the sermon yet okay this is all just
preemptive
strikes
identity owner parents what they do is
they tend to get their identity their
meaning their purpose and their sense of
well-being from their
children that's who they are look at my
kids they tend to saddle their children
with the unbearable burden of their
parents' sense of
self-worth I feel good about who I am
because look at
Johnny Ambassador parents however
approach parenting as a re
representative with a deep sense of
identity they already know who they are
they're a child of the king they're an
ambassador representing the king they
don't need to feel insecure about that
that's a gift from God you've got it you
don't need anything else Representatives
with a deep sense of this identity are
motivated by meaning and purpose that
they have gotten from the one whom they
represent the Lord Jesus Christ and they
understand that that's their identity
what about work let's see how owner
parents think and then how Ambassador
parents think when it comes to work
owner parents think their job is to turn
their children into
something they have a vision of what
they want their children to be and they
think their work is to use their
Authority their time their money and
their energy to form their children into
what they conceive that their children
should
be you feeling that yet Ambassador
parents really do understand they are
never anything more than representatives
of someone greater someone wiser someone
more powerful someone more gracious than
they are they know their work is to
introduce Jesus and not their ch turn
their children into
anything they have come to understand
that they have no power whatsoever to
change their children really that
without God's wisdom they wouldn't even
know what even is even close to being
best for their
children that's work what about success
maybe you'll begin to understand what
I'm talking about yet as you probably
haven't got it yet we talk about owner
parents how do they see success they
tend to be working toward a specific
catalog of indicators in the lives of
their children that tell them they
succeeded things like academic
performance if my kids aren't making
then I'm not succeeding academic
performance athletic achievement look at
that trophy on the wall musical ability
he can sing social likeability everybody
loves my kid because the horizontal
markers of how well they have done their
job you see wait a second the sticker on
the back of the car isn't for the kid
then Ambassador
parents have face the scary
truth that they have no power at all to
produce anything in their
children and thus they haven't attached
their definition of success to a catalog
of horizontal out
comes successful parenting to them is
being usable and useful in the hands of
the one who alone is able to really
produce good
things in their
kids reputation let's talk about that
maybe you'll get it when I get through
this one so how do owner parents look at
reputation and how to Ambassador parents
look at reputation well honor parents
unwittingly turn their children into
their trophies
they parade their children in public to
the Applause of the people around them
oh look at my
great children in these homes feel both
the burden of carrying their parents'
reputation and the sting of the
embarrassment when they
don't and eventually they
won't what about Ambassador parents
they've come to understand that
parenting
Sinners which is what you're little rats
are will expose us all to
embarrassment just as we've been
embarrassed oursel by our own
behaviors they accept The Humbling messy
the
messiness that God has called us to do
which
is to show them
Jesus even though we're messing
up they understand if their children
mature in God
godliness they're not our
trophies they're
his he can put them on his shf I have no
right to
that so on us look at three biblical
principles I know some of you sitting
there going I don't agree with that at
all I don't like what he's saying I
don't agree with that blah blah blah
can't wait to get home talk to my wife
well you're going to love these 15
weeks number one and Ambassador parents
are called to be
reconcilers that's the job of a
Ambassador according to text we read a
while ago I'll read it again verse 19
that is that God was in Christ
reconciling the world to himself that's
amazing and he did this for himself they
got out of position he created them they
got out of position with himself because
of what he created and now he's
reconciling them to himself through
Christ that he sent himself he saved
them by himself from himself that is
that God was in Christ reconciling the
world to himself not imputing their
trespasses to them and has committed to
us the word of reconciliation now then
we are ambassadors for Christ as though
God was pleading through us we implore
you on Christ's behalf to be reconciled
to God now this word Ambassador is an
interesting word it's actually where we
get Presbyterian or presbuteros it's
that same kind of root word has to do
with being older but it also means to be
a representative and we are ambassadors
for Christ as though God were pleading
through us one of the jobs of an
ambassador is to plead for Christ you
say I don't like that term I'm in
charge you're in
charge but we need to plead for Christ
to our
children number two
ambassadors and Ambassador parents are
called to be
revealers somebody's got to do
it somebody's got to do it it's what a
Ambassador does in Ephesians 6 it uses
that same term again verse 19 and as for
me that utterance may be given to me
that I may open my mouth boldly to make
known The Mystery of the Gospel you mean
some folks don't know it sure maybe it's
your kids verse 20 for which I am an
ambassador in
chains that in it I may speak boldly as
I ought to speak he's in prison at that
time but he's been an ambassador in
Chains but he needs to speak the
mystery so this means that we
particularly parents are to teach for
Christ that means teach we'll talk more
about that in a week or two but to
teach you can't just not say anything
about Jesus in your
house they don't belong to you you
better hurry up and tell them something
they need to know something about the
Mysteries third
list told you go straight be quick when
we get to the
punchline here it actually uses a
different word it's not a different word
it's the same Ro words but it means the
same thing uh it's in translated the
Aged in this text Ambassador parents are
called to be requesters verses 89 of fan
it says therefore though I might be very
bold in Christ to command you what is
fitting he uses a little bit of
manipulation here with him in verse n
yet for Love's sake I rather appeal to
you I'm not going to command you to do
something I'm appealing to you but such
a one as Paul the Aged which is the word
for Ambassador and now also a prisoner
of Jesus Christ Titus 2:2 uses the word
the same way uses it as the word the
older but it's where we get the root uh
presbuteros this means that we are
according to this text as that type of
person the older one who would be an
emissary we are to appeal for Christ so
I don't like this talk Rex we're to
plead we're to teach and we're to appeal
for Christ where's our punch our
Authority you haven't lost it my friend
why is it that that's where we
go that bothers me that I need to even
say that you think I could take away
your Authority you have it really is
that what you need to feel
good these are not so much steps or
techniques to be
learned but attitudes of his grace if
I'm a
steward and I'm an ambass ambassador
he's the king and I'm his Ambassador
creating relationship with the child
that lives in my
house then I should be a
reconciler I should be a revealer of
Secrets I should be a requester pleading
appealing so please don't take this as
some weak need unauthoritative form of
parenting I'm not advocating for that at
all
but I'm also not advocating for you to
feel like you own your kids because you
don't and you need to get grips with
that you don't fact is you don't own
anything David fiser 21st
century uh Pastor said that's the name
of the book A Vision based on the
ministry of Paul wrote these
words and what's interesting to me is
I've actually I've actually seen the
king not the king you're thinking I've
seen the king that we're talking about
here and I've seen some of his work I've
been right up to his house so this is a
real guy but it's not who you
think I served on the board of a I'm
reading now I served on the board of a
Christian college for several years
during that time the government of
swasiland
the government of swas land been there a
few times wanted to recruit Christian
School teachers to come to their country
and help them set up a Christian School
System Swaziland is a monarchy it is a
king and this was the desire of the
king swasiland ambassador to the United
Nations was Nelson
molinga he came to the college to
interview students I was privileged
along with another board member and
students that would graduate and then go
and teach from their college I was
privileged along with another board
member to serve as his host for two days
it was an eye openening
experience my life and my in my lifetime
in a democracy had not prepared me for
the power of a
monarchy I had never before met a
government official and I discovered
that ambassadors are a very special type
of governmental official
ambassadors of a king are even more
unusual the first thing I noticed was Mr
malinga's sense of
dignity it was quickly apparent that he
was the personal representative of a
king his office bore an inherent power
that gave the Ambassador
great
confidence you feeling that parents
from his behavior it was clear that he
was well aware he spoke for the
king he was quick to say the king
says if anyone had question his
authority or his word or anything he had
said he could have simply
replied call the
king Mr malinga's dignified confidence
rested it in his assurance that he spoke
for a monarch who had nearly absolute
power and he
does because the Ambassador spoke for
the king a certain Authority accompanied
everything he did or
said parents you feel
that at the same time however the
Ambassador was quite
reserved he didn't just behave any which
way he's quite reserved at all times he
deferred to the king from whom his
confidence and power came for neither
the message he spoke nor the mission he
was on were his own you get that one
neither the message you speak nor the
mission that you were on belongs to you
quit acting like it
does it
doesn't at night when the meetings were
over and we all went back to our hotels
Mr melinga had one last task he called
home to talk to his
King message in that
and when you don't know what to
do call
home talk to your
king he had known the king all of his
life that's a good truth isn't
it he had known the king all of his life
and represented his King and this King
he loved and he respected
it it's important isn't
it I think that much of the ambassador's
dignity and quiet sense of authority see
those of you who needed that Authority
thing emphasize
listen I think that much of the
ambassador's dignity and quiet sense of
authority came not just from his high
office which you have as a parent but
also from his relationship with the
King you need to have a Rel relationship
with the King if you're going to be an
ambassador for him wouldn't you think
actually would have to know something
about what he
wants he knew what the king thought what
the king desired he lived to make the
king's wishes come into
being there you have it
parents embarrassed her
par with all authority of an ambassador
let me simply do this
let me plead for Christ
tonight if you haven't given your life
to Christ I plead with you give your
life to
Christ let me teach you about Christ
without Jesus Christ there is no hope
for any of us the Grace has been
bestowed to us all if we will receive
it and let me appeal for
Christ Christ is waiting on the other
side if you give your life to him
I want to be United with my king what
about
you I want to be an ambassador every
day you say well I don't think this has
anything to do with parenting I can just
feel somebody's thinking
that everything about the gospel has
everything to do with every aspect of
your
life that's the problem when we start
segmenting parts of our life and saying
well my job is
work Jesus doesn't have anything to do
with my
work well that's my sport that has
nothing to do with Jesus well I'm going
on a vacation that's got nothing to do
with
Jesus I have children that's got nothing
to do Jesus no no no you're an
ambassador for a
king quit thinking you own them
represent the king that's your job
if you're willing to give your life to
the Lord and you haven't well an
ambassador you aren't not for the king
so maybe you want to become one why
don't you come if you need to why don't
we standing while we sing
