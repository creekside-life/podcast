we struggle with a lot of
things we struggle with faith I know I
struggle with faith
personally and then of course we
struggle with our
Brethren during the work in China a
missionary named Hudson Taylor wrote to
his wife in a bad time when they were
just struggling to get by he wrote these
words
we have 25
cents and all the promises of
God faith is a
struggle we don't just struggle with
faith we struggle with edification or
building up we struggle with that
personally and then we struggle with our
Brethren Blair
Walsh was a
kicker for the
Vikings from uh 2015
2016 uh he was 33 of 34 field goals from
30 yards
away which is pretty good by the
way but he in they got into the playoffs
with the Seattle Seahawks and they were
down 10 to n with 22 seconds left and
Walsh who had been hitting everything
lined up for a 27 yd field goal which
was it within the the 30
yards he
missed they lost their season was
over social media as you can imagine
stormed and just raged against
walls but a group of first graders from
the town that they're in Ali
Edwards uh organized and she wrote Blair
was really sad so we wanted to make him
feel better and one of her classmates
wrote dear Blair Walsh I think you
should keep
trying sometimes a word of edification a
word of
encouragement is hard to
give and sometimes not heard so we
struggle with edification we struggle
not just with faith and edification but
we struggle with patience especially
personally but then with
Brethren James Austin in
2022 wrote when my oldest daughter was
15 months old my wife and I were at a
youth convention during the
summer as she walked back to the
dormatory with her little girl in toe
Anna their little girl kept stopping and
laying down on the
sidewalk apparently it was a long walk
mom would heave her back up and walk a
few more feet but Anna would then try to
lay down again on her
back and so Mom was starting to get
frustrated with little Anna and was
fussing at her and finally mom stopped
and got down on the ground with Anna and
looked up and at that moment she saw
what little Anna had been
seeing the stars and the Summer Sky were
an amazing
display sometimes patience is just being
able to see it from the angle that the
other person's looking at
it see other people's side of the
coin but I think we all struggle with
faith edification for others and
ourselves and patience especially when
it comes to the idea of unity The Plea
of the Churches of Christ
is Unity let us be United and today
United by the steps we've talked about
how that we live in a fallen world and
so division has been our friend and our
enemy at the same time the division
being our friend because it's prevented
a tyrannical Unity of all nations of the
world because that would not be a safe
thing I know that's true because of
Genesis
11 so I don't have to guess that that'd
be true we all dream of one all
everybody getting along but it wouldn't
work out the way you think it would it
would be a bad
thing because we live in a fallen
world and in a fallen world we still yet
are called by the Lord who wants us to
be United to
unite it was prayed for by Jesus it was
preached by Paul we read the passage a
moment
ago but we struggle because it's this
and it's that
but we should be United on the steps of
Salvation here they
are we are taught to that we must hear
the gospel Romans 10:17 says faith comes
by hearing and hearing by the word of
God we're taught that we must believe
the gospel Hebrews 11:6 says without
faith it's impossible to please him for
he who comes to God must believe that he
is and that he's the rewarder of them
that diligently seek him
we taught that we must repent of our
past sins Luke 13:3 and 5 both say the
same thing except you repent you will
all likewise perish we all must change
our
heart we must confess confess faith in
Jesus Christ it's not so much about
confessing sin as it is about confessing
faith in Jesus because confession we're
told in Romans 10:10 is made unto
salvation which is what we really want
and then we must be baptized Galatians
3:27 among other passages say the same
thing that we're baptized into Christ
where salvation is
so
everyone is not United on these five
steps but we should be they're so simple
they're so straightforward they're basic
things right and we're to teach this may
not be known but we are to teach the
same thing
everywhere that's what Paul did 1
Corinthians 4:17 says I have sent
Timothy to you who is my beloved and
faithful son in the Lord who will remind
you of my ways in Christ as I
teach everywhere in every church so
every church should have heard the same
message right so when it comes to
The Plan of
Salvation that should be taught
basically
everywhere now the restoration movement
of which the Churches of Christ are part
of believe in being biblical being very
biblical 1 Peter 4:1 says if anyone
speaks let him speak as the Oracles of
God I've been chatted a few times for
using too many
scriptures not just once I've been
chatting a lot actually for that
but actually isn't that the only thing
that's worth listening
to is anything I say really valuable
other than maybe explaining what he said
if I can do
that so I agree with the slogans that
have been both popular in the Churches
of Christ I really do I I I'm not saying
this lightly I I've given my life to
this in matters of Faith Unity in
matters of opinion Liberty in all things
charity I'd like to claim that the
Church of Christ invented that slogan
they did not it was invented by a Peter
or something and another German Luther
back in
1627 but it's still a good
say just because somebody else came up
with it or the saying no book but the
Bible no Creed but Christ no law but
love that came into being in the stone
Campbell movement is one of the early
19th century SL an I still think it is a
really good slogan and we ought to pay
attention to it I I still think speak
where the Bible speaks and be silent
where the Bible is silent is a great
statement Alexander Campbell probably
coined that in about 1809 he also coined
do Bible things in Bible ways and call
Bible things by Bible names and it was
about that same time he coined that
statement I I really agree with that
statement
but what are the term the five steps of
Salvation it's not a biblical
term it fits it's
correct it's not a biblical term and so
when I originally we're going to preach
on this I got to be honest with you that
was where I was
going that was my plan the whole lesson
would be about that problem was is that
that's not the primary way that the uses
the term the
steps so I'm going to try to focus on
one primary way to speak where the Bible
speaks and be silent where the Bible is
silent and call Bible things by Bible
names and do Bible things in Bible ways
I'm going to try to use it the way the
New Testament uses the term the steps
which it never uses it in the five steps
of the Plan of Salvation there's no such
term but don't let that worry you
there's no such term as Trinity in the
Bible and we all believe in the Trinity
so just because the term is not in the
Bible doesn't mean it's not a Biblical
idea but I'm going to try to be even a
little more biblical if I can and give
you as I understand it three ways we can
go a little higher than just hear
believe repent confess and be baptized
and follow the steps here we go number
one let us be United by the steps of the
faith of Abraham let me read the text
then we'll talk about it begins in
Romans chapter 4 I encourage you to read
the these passages with me I'm going to
read the whole thing you what you got up
there is just a portion of it beginning
in verse one What then shall we say that
Abraham our father has found according
to the flesh for If Abraham was
justified by works he has something to
boast about but not before God see even
Abraham the father of the faithful
didn't go to heaven because he was such
a good man verse three for what does the
scripture say Abraham believed God and
it was accounted to him for
righteousness no he was attributed
righteousness just by faith verse four
now to him who works the wages are not
counted as Grace but as debt you go to
work get a check on Friday they owe that
money to you actually verse five but to
him who does not work but believes on
him who justifies the ungodly his faith
is accounted for righteousness wow so
even if you don't do much for the Lord
but you believe that Faith Can Be Your
Righteous act verse six just as David
also described the blessedness of the
man to whom God imputes righteousness
apart from works when he says in verse
7even blessed are those whose Lawless
Deeds are forgiven and whose sins are
covered verse 8 blessed is the man to
whom the Lord shall not impute sin so he
doesn't count his sin against him that's
a blessing verse n does this blessing BL
this then come upon the circumcised only
or upon the uncircumcised also so he's
dealing with the subject of circumcision
here and whether or not the new Gentiles
needed to be circumcised does this
blessedness then come upon the
circumcised only or upon the
uncircumcised also so in other words can
the Jews be the only one that received
this blessing of Salvation through faith
even though they're not all that great
because of what Abraham did or does the
uncircum
uncircumcised get that same blessing
does this blessedness then come upon the
circumcised only or upon the
uncircumcised also for we say that Faith
was accounted Abraham for righteousness
how then was it accounted while he was
circumcised or uncircumcised not while
circumcised but while uncircumcised he
this was said in Genesis 15 Verse 6 and
he was not circumcised until Genesis 17:
9 through 14 verse 11 goes on I'm still
in your passage and he received the sign
of circumcision a seal of righteousness
of the faith which he had while still
uncircumcised that he might be the
father of all who believe he is our
father because we're Sav because we
believe though they are uncircumcised
right in heart ears and in body that
righteousness might be imputed to them
also so we have obtained the
righteousness imputed to us through the
cross of of Christ verse 12 and the
father of circumcision to those who not
only are of the circumcision but who
also walk here it is in the steps of the
faith which Our Father Abraham had while
still circumcised Faith saves and yet
Faith Works and that's the point if you
are going to walk in the steps of
Abraham you must walk in the steps of
Faith but that Faith Works and so that's
Abraham he believed and received
righteousness and then later he is
circumcised and so two it isn't about
all the good works you do you don't have
to live a Godly life perfect to go to
heaven that's not required but you are
required to try to do the works of
Abraham and to have the faith of Abraham
which saves that's an important little
lesson number two
talking about the steps that are
mentioned in the scriptures but let us
be United by the steps of the
edification of Brethren okay or
Believers if you want to use that 2
Corinthians chap 12: 14-19 is where the
next time this term is used now for the
third time I'm ready to come to you and
I will not be burdensome to you for I do
not seek yours but you I'm not after
your money I'm not after your stuff
I'm after you this is Paul for the
children ought not to lay up for the
parents but the parents for the children
I'm not trying to live off of you I'm
trying to take care of you but it might
look to some of you like I'm trying to
live off of you that's just what he's
saying verse 15 and I will very gladly
spend and be spent for your souls I
would use the last penny I had for you
I'm not after your money though far the
more abundantly I love you the less I'm
loved which is often the case the more
you love someone the less sometimes
people love you back verse 16 but be
that as it may however that ends up I
did not burden you in other words when I
was with you I didn't do that
nevertheless being crafty he's being
sarcastic now nevertheless being crafty
I caught you by cunning did I take
advantage of you by any of those whom I
sin so I didn't take advantage of you
did the people that I sent to you did
they take advantage of you was it all
about money did I take advantage of you
by any of those whom I sent to you verse
18 I urged Titus and sent our brother
with him so I sent Titus and some other
guys did Titus take advantage of you was
it all about money was it all about what
we could get out of you clothing food
whatever it was did he not Walk In The
Same Spirit did he not behave just like
I did did we not walk in the same steps
there it is the same steps again do you
think that we excuse ourselves you we
speak before God in Christ but we do all
things beloved for your
edification I'll tell you this we've
actually asked people to leave this
church
before who wanted to use you as a source
of income
that's happened people have been asked
to leave here because they wouldn't
leave you alone they were after making
money off of you by the way if you want
to be a member here to make money off of
us we're going to find out and we're
going to have a
conversation that isn't appropriate do
your business out there don't do your
business in here don't get our mailing
address and use that make money off of
us amen amen amen walls this is not the
place for your business amen I'd like to
hear a better amen than that
amen amen so now so we're not to take
advantage here's what we are to do
according to that the steps we're
supposed to walk not are just the
abrahamic steps of Faith but we're to
walk the steps of not just not taking
advantage but edifying one another we
are so it's your respon responsibility
to encourage the person sitting next to
you we're not about taking we're about
giving
amen amen number
next didn't expect that from that lesson
didn't you okay here we go number
next let us be United by the steps of
the patience of Christ this is only the
third time this terminology is used so
pay attention to it it says for this is
commen able if because of conscience
toward God one endures grief suffering
wrongfully which he's talking about
being mistreated in the world we live in
and by the way if you think mistreating
people is
new you must be very young okay uh verse
20 for what credit is it if when you are
beaten for your faults you take it
patiently if you do wrong and you get
pulled over what are you fussing about
but when you do good and suffer if you
take it patiently when you're patient
then this is commendable before God all
these videos I'm seeing where people are
bragging about taking on the police in
the car shame on them that's no way to
be we're to be people who are patient
not trying to show who you can't push
around that's not who we
are this is commendable before God for
to this you were called do you
understand your calling you're not
called to be a tough guy you're not
called to be able to tell people get off
my prop talk to don't you dare talk to
me like that you weren't called to do
that I wasn't called to do that we're
not called to be tough guys there's a
different kind of tough and that is when
you don't do it and you could that's a
horse you ever notice what we call a
gentle horse it's one that kick your
brains out but never
will listen to me again for to this you
were called because Christ Christ also
suffered for us are you telling me that
Jesus couldn't have stop
that twist his finger and everybody on
the planets
gone leaving us an example that you
should follow his
steps there it is who committed no sin
wow that's a call is't it you pick up on
that following his steps means don't
sin it doesn't just mean be patient it
means don't sin
nor was deceit found in his mou you know
what that means if you want to follow
Christ you can't lie amen
amen who when he was
reviled did not rev you don't talk to me
like that no he didn't revile in return
when he suffered he did not threaten but
committed himself to him who judges
righteously here's the
deal we are I don't know if we I don't
know if we're up to apprenticing
Jesus that's a tall order because I'll
be honest with you I have just as much
trouble with patience as anybody else
especially in traffic if they just it's
obvious they're on their phone
right move
alone
right um so the distinct plea see
because this is what I'm talking out
today should govern us here more than
anywhere else the distinct plea of the
Churches of Christ is let us be United
by the steps yes the steps here believe
repent confess be baptized absolutely we
should support those because those are
biblical but the term the steps are
applied to these things in the New
Testament the steps of the faith of
Abraham believing what you cannot
see look at the stars and that's how
many many descendants you'll have when
you've had no
children that's
Faith the edification of other believers
not what I can get out of them not what
they can do for me but what can I do for
them how can I encourage them there's a
step and then the steps of the patience
of
Christ doing nothing to to them
back taking
it hit me again
buddy taking it
all this is so
basic it is so basic it's literally the
ABCs of our faith the steps of Abraham
the steps of Brethren and the steps of
Christ they're great examples of Faith
everywhere you don't have to go very far
you begin to see them I've I can't help
but mention and these are not
necessarily members of the church but I
have to say their faith is amazing
Joanie ericon toada on the radio written
40 plus books been paralyzed ever since
she was a teenager and yet she still
believes you know how hard that
is Gertrude bidy Chambers probably don't
even know who that is Gertrude bitty
Chambers you won't see it on the book
there's a little book going around that
I bet you've read some from My Utmost
For His
Highest and she's the one that actually
got us that book was from the work of
her husband but she made the
book Charles Coulson prison fellowship
yeah I know he is involved in the
Watergate scandal but that prison
fellowship was
amazing Francis Jan
Crosby or as we know her Fanny Crosby
you know Fanny Crosby is you should you
sing your songs
regularly she was blinded as an infant
and at the age of eight she wrote her
first poem but folks she wrote at eight
oh what a happy child I am though I
cannot see and she really was she had
irrepressible uh Joy about life a great
memory let me tell you how great her
memory was just so you know a blind girl
she could quote Genesis Exodus Leviticus
Numbers Matthew Mark Luke John word for
word can you do
that can I do
that she wrote over
8,000 hymns so yes you've sung her
hymns she did that for 51 years and her
hymns were known throughout the
world Listen to This One Pastor me not

I love to Proclaim it Jesus Keep Me Near
The
Cross in the cross I am thine O Lord
draw me nearer still nearer he hideth my
soul in the CFT of the
rock tell me the story of
Jesus I believe one of the songs we sang
this morning of Fanny
Crosby so are you an example of great
faith are you an example of great
edification are you an example of great
peace see if we want to claim that we
are all about Unity it starts with
me I have to be about
Unity John Moore I want to talk about
him a little bit tonight so you need to
come back but John
Moore uh wrote a song for Steve Green
many years ago Steve Green made it
popular it's one of my favorite it's
about faithfulness and there I I'm not
going to get into why he wrote that
right now I'll talk about it tonight but
John Moore m o HR if you want to know
how you spell it he wrote we're
pilgrims on the Journey of the narrow
road and those who gone before us ly the
way cheering on the
faithful encouraging the weary their
lives a stirring testament to God's
sustaining Grace surrounded by so great
a cloud of witnesses let us run the race
not only for the prize but as those
who've gone before us let us leave to
those behind us the her itage of
faithfulness passed on through Godly
lives oh may all who come behind you and
me Find Us Faithful May the fire of our
devotion light the way may the
footprints that we
leave lead them to
believe and the lives we live Inspire
them to obey oh may all who come behind
us Find Us Faithful after all our hopes
and dreams have come and gone and our
children sift through all we've left
behind all the Clutter May the clues
that they discover and the memories they
uncover become the light that leads them
to the road we each must find oh may all
who come behind us Find Us
Faithful faithful how was
Abraham
encouraging that was
Paul and then of course
patience that was our Lord and Savior
Jesus
Christ you know if we apply those we'll
have unity in this church and the whole
world will be full of his
glory if you're here today and you
decided to receive the Plan of Salvation
we
will help you in that process
today but the rest of us we need to have
a change of heart we need to be
committed to
Unity it's what he prayed for and it's
what Paul pleaded for
