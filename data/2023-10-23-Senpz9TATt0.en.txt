yeah you don't hear too many two-hour
long lessons but
uh we
all have hard
tests and they test our
faith and it's tough for any of us to
get from here to
there I'll just mention the Dutton
family and I'm talking to the broader
family that you don't even know much
of like you we faced many tests of our
faith through many
hardships like you we Face
sickness I've seen to mention here I've
seen Heath Emily Bethany Deb and myself
on death's
doorstep like you we faced
hospitalization surgeries scary
prognosis like you we face our share of
tragedies deaths
divorce Financial setbacks mental issues
traumas attempted suicides alcohol drug
abuse been victims of crimes of rapes of
abuse of thefts and of many
threats the duttons like you have been
blessed like you
even though your faith is
tried God's blessed you through it we
have had healings from sicknesses from
surgeries from
diseases and giving our last we've run
out of
gas and yet in the middle of giving your
last and being totally empty God would
always come
through just like you and some somehow
we would sit hugging each other thanking
the Lord that we made it
through it takes Faith because for us
all it is hard to get from here to
there what Joseph went through was tough
for him to become the deliverer that
would literally save the world it was
hard on his faith what Moses had to go
through to become the deliverer of the
Israel was hard on his faith what David
had to go through to become the king of
Israel that would deliver Israel over
and over again was hard on his
faith you could even speak of our entire
country as spoke earlier America has
gone through a lot to get from there to
here July the 4th 1776 was an
announcement it didn't fix anything
there was a revolutionary war and men
died there was a Civil War and men died
there were world wars and men died and
then there were depressions and there
were civil rights issues and there was
911 and there's been covid it hasn't
been
easy life can be
tough but it can especially be tough if
you don't realize that it's only by
faith you get from here to
there the path of faith and getting to
Heaven is hard Matthew 19: 23 through
24 spells it out this way then Jesus
said to his disciples assuredly I say to
you that it is hard for rich man to
enter the kingdom of heaven and again
and by the way every American is Rich
compared to everybody else in the world
so this sign on here and again I say to
you it is easier for a camel to go
through the eye of a needle than for a
rich man to enter the kingdom of God
when his disciples heard that they were
greatly astonished saying who then can
be saved if it's that hard we're sunk
but but then Jesus looked at them and
said to them with men this is
impossible so you can't save
yourself we're all
doomed but With
God all things are possible that means
with faith it's possible in fact Hebrews
11 that starts out the text we're going
to be looking at today please turn to
Hebrews 11 if you have a Bible or a
device turn there that's where we're
going to be to get through 12 points I
have to move along but let me remind you
what Hebrews 11 in verse 6 that sets the
stage for all we're going to look at
says but without faith it is
impossible wait minute I thought it was
possible with God no without faith you
don't have God so without faith it is
impossible to please him for he who
comes to God Must Believe that he is and
that he is the rewarder of those who
diligently seek him so faith is
essential not kind of essential it is
the
thing and if a preacher gets up and
tells you that the Christian Life is
easy you should run for the
hills and go find somebody who won't lie
to you about
it I want just look at 12 quick examples
number one to get from here to there we
have to develop the worship of Faith oh
yes you must engage in worship if you
want to claim Faith Hebrews 11:4 by
faith Abel offered to God a better
sacrifice than Cain through which he
obtained the testimony that he was
righteous and testifying about his gifts
and through faith though he is dead he
still speaks you can't get from here to
there without the enough Faith to go to
worship number
two to get from here to there we have to
develop the Walk of Faith Hebrews 11 and
verse 5 says by faith Enoch was taken up
so that he should not see death and he
was not found because God took him up
for he obtained the witness that before
his being taken up he was pleasing to
God what was that witness Genesis 5:24
he walked with God let me emphasize this
you don't get from here to there unless
you walk with God my friend daily number
three to get from here to there we have
to develop the works of Faith yes you
Faith Hebrews 11: 8-10 says by faith
Abraham when he was called obeyed by
going out to a place which he was to
receive for an inheritance and he went
out not knowing where he was going oh
yes my friend if you want to have faith
you have to start when you don't know
how you're going to finish number verse
vers 9 goes on to say by faith he lived
as an alien in the land of promise he
didn't get what he was promised yet as
in a foreign land dwelling in tents
which Isaac and Jacob fellow Heirs of
the same promise for he was looking for
the city which has foundations whose
architect and Builder is God that's the
ways of Faith going and stumbling and
not knowing where you're going what
what's going to happen next that's what
faith does it just goes number
next verse F number five to get from
here to there we have to develop the
welcoming of Faith what do I mean by
that listen to Hebrews 11 beginning in
verse 11 by faith even Sarah herself
received ability to conceive she
received it
by faith the ability to conceive even
beyond the proper time of life since she
considered him faithful who had promised
therefore also there was born of one man
and him as good as dead at that as many
descendants as the stars of Heaven in
number and innumerable as the sand which
is by the seashore all these die di in
faith that's the critical key they died
in faith without receiving the promises
but having seen them and having welcomed
them from a
distance I'll get back to that in a
moment and having confessed that they
were strangers in Exiles on the earth
the welcoming of faith is welcoming the
promises that you have not
seen I welcome
the trip to Heaven amen I welcome it but
I have not seen it I have not seen it I
welcome that Christ died on the cross I
didn't see Christ I welcome it that's
what faith does it not only is glad to
hear about it it welcomes it as a part
of what it believes from then on number
six to get from here to there we have to
develop the wants of Faith you got to
have the desire that faith has verse 14
says for those who say such things make
it clear that they are seeking a country
of their own this is not what we're
seeking faith is not seeking this verse
15 and indeed they have been thinking of
that country from which they went out
they would have had opportunity to
return go back to ER you know or her
heran verse 16 but as it is they desire
a better country there is a lot better
country than the United States of
America oh didn't hear an Amen on that
let me try it again there is a lot
better country than the United States of
America amen that is a Heavenly one
therefore God is not ashamed to call
their them their God for he has prepared
a city for them to be called there God
sorry next one number seven to get from
here to there we have to develop the
willingness of Faith are you willing to
do what faith requires you to do verse
17 by faith Abraham when he was tested
offered up Isaac are you really willing
have you thought that one through your
only child Faith by faith Abraham when
he was tested offered up Isaac and he
who had received the promise
was offering up his only begotten son it
was he to whom it was said in Isaac your
descendants shall be called he
considered that God is able to raise men
even from the dead from which he also
received him back as a type there wasn't
anybody that been raised from the dead
before and he still believed it and he
was still willing because he believed
the promise do you believe the promise
is enough When Death gets involved are
you still willing to
do that's a different Faith number
eight to get from here to there we have
to develop the waiting of Faith oh yes
my friend you don't get instantaneous
blessings every time you need them every
time you want what you want that is not
what happens to people of faith it says
in verse vers 20 by faith Isaac blessed
Jacob and Esau even regarding things to
come well they didn't have it right then
verse 21 by faith Jacob as he was dying
blessed each of his sons of Joseph and
worshiped leaning on the top of his
staff by faith Joseph when he was dying
made mention of The Exodus they were
dying and still believing something was
coming made mention of The Exodus of the
sons of Israel and gave orders
concerning his bones that's how long he
was willing to wait and sure enough his
bones went there number nine to get from
here to there we have to develop the
worth of Faith look at verse 23 by faith
Moses when he was born was hidden for
three months by his parents because they
saw he was a beautiful child and they
were not afraid of the king's edict that
could have been death for them verse 24
by faith Moses when he had grown up
refused to be called the son of
Pharaoh's daughter I don't want any part
of that all that money most powerful
country in the world at the time I don't
want any part of that I don't need any
of that verse 25 choosing rather to
endure ill treatment with the people of
God than to enjoy the passing pleasures
of sin what you
serving
pleasure or be with the people of God 26
considering the reproach of Christ
greater riches than the treasures of
Egypt for he was looking to the reward
is that greater treasure than here faith
says yes
amen develop the worth of Faith whatever
it cost that's worth it number 10 to get
from here to there we have to develop
the Winds of Faith that's W NS The Winds
of faith not wind verse 27 by faith he
left Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the
king for he endured as seeing him who is
unseen by faith he kept the Passover and
the sprinkling of blood so that he who
destroyed the firstborn might not touch
him let me tell you something our side
wins the other side is crushed make no
mistake our side wins listen to the rest
of this verse 29 by faith they passed
through the Red Sea as though they were
passing through dry land and the
Egyptians when they attempted it were
drowned the other side loses by faith
the walls of Jericho fell down after
they had encircle it for seven days our
side wins their side loses by faith AB
the Harlot did not perish along with
those who were disobedient after she had
welcomed the spies in peace our side
wins the other side perishes and what
more shall I say for time will fail me
if I tell you if Gideon baric Samson
jeepa David Samuel the prophets Faith by
faith conquered our side wins their size
lose by faith conquered kingdoms before
acts of righteousness obtained promises
shut the mouths of lions the other guys
that went in there after Daniel were
eaten our side winds their side loses
quenches the power of fire the guys who
threw them in the fire died the ones in
the fire walked around with the Fourth
Man our side went escapes the edge of
the sword from weakness were made strong
being mighty in war put foreign armies
to flight how many times did David do
that
our side wins Faith wins you may think
it loses that's because you have so
little
faith if you have faith you start
recognizing Faith
wins even when it looks like it loses
you ever heard of Jesus he looked like
he lost didn't he to get from here to
there we have to develop the wisdom of
Faith what's the Wis wisdom of faith in
verse 35 women received back their dead
by resurrection and others were and here
it is here's the wisdom of Faith
tortured not accepting their release
they could have got out of
it by
denying but they wouldn't
deny they were willing to be tortured in
order that they might obtain a better
Resurrection that's wisdom my friend you
go through hard things now for the
cause to have a better one there amen so
whatever you can do do a little more
it'll make that even better whatever it
is and number last to get from here to
there we have to develop the
worthiness of Faith worthiness listen to
verse 37 again it was read earlier let
me read through it quick they were
stoned they were stwn in two that's
Isaiah they were
tempted they were put to death with the
sword quite a number of prophets
were they went about in sheep skins and
goat
skins being destitute Afflicted ill
treated wearing that kind of clothing
because you couldn't afford actual cloth
or
linen of whom the world was not worthy
the world's not worthy of such
attitudes wandering in deserts and
mountains and caves and holes in the
ground and all these having gained
approval through their faith oh they
were going
there they did not receive what was
promised you mean you're willing to live
your life and not get all the things you
would really like to have absolutely
amen absolutely well that's strong amen
y'all with me
because God had provided something
better for
us so that apart from us they should not
be made perfect so that's a
lesson I will not repeat all 12 of
them you know it's hard to get from here
to there is the message if you don't
believe it take a long look at the cross
and let me say something to you here
about the cross the cross was harder
than you
think
we haven't touched how hard it
was oh no there's so many pieces of how
hard that was you've never experienced
anything that
hard no
nothing have you ever wondered though
here's the question have you ever after
all this have you ever
wondered why is it so hard
has that ever hit you like that all the
way I mean you got to it's hard all the
way to you I mean you think well I'm you
know I'm 50 now it won't be hard now I'm
60 now it won't be hard now I'm 70 it
won't be hard now I'm 80 it won't be
hard now oh no no no no all the way in
that march to Heaven it is hard every
step of the
way
why here's the thought maybe the
hardness attracts you to
it Luke
14:27 whoever does not bear his cross
and come after me cannot be my
disciple something about that pulls us
sin Matthew
2413 he who endures to the end shall be
he
saved a faith that goes from here to
there with
God almost wants it to be
hard have you
noticed it's strange Theodore Roosevelt
26 president one of the youngest
president if not the youngest said
nothing in the world is worth
doing
unless it's
hard or difficult and full of pain and
effort and
difficulty it seems that we love it if
you don't believe that here's a
interesting article that came
up July the 30th 2023 Associated Press
article said Marine recruiting
surges while other services are
struggling Marine leaders say they will
make their recruiting goal this year
while the active duty Army Navy and Air
Force all expect to fall
short you remember that saying the
few the proud the
Marines maybe it's that scent of it
being really
hard it draws Us
in have you ever considered that had
Christ been on a cross from the not
because he wasn't the same but just from
the perspective of following would it be
as
appealing would you be pulled
in there's something there let me give
you a story then I'll be
through Chuck Swindle Charles Swindle
wrote a book living above the level of
mediocrity he tells an interesting story
there now I know Disney is not as
popular as it was but I want to talk to
you about Walt Disney okay so now Walt
Disney several years ago uh Chuck
swindall said he met a gentleman who
served on one of Walt Disney's uh boards
uh one of his advisory
boards and he said the early days of
Disney were really tough they were much
harder than you probably have heard they
were tough just to make
it
and this guy Walt Disney just refused
ched to give
up and so whenever he would go to his
board he would often go to his board
with some idea it always seemed like it
was outlandish it always seemed like it
was impossible crazy and so whenever he
would present something they said that
the board their eye they would blink
they would stare they you know move
around they because they they thought
this is crazy and so did
but unless this was Disney now listen to
this unless every member resisted the
idea every member of the board must find
it foolish and be
wrong unless every member of the board
did that this board member said Disney
usually didn't even pursue
it he said but the challenge wasn't big
enough enough in his mind to Merit his
time and Creative Energy unless they
were
unanimously in disagreement with his
idea unless it was the hardest possible
thing he didn't even want to be
involved folks that life out there with
all its hardships is easier than this
life and I'm I'm excited about
it faith will walk where it's
hardest and keep moving if you want that
kind of Faith you can repent of your
sins confess the name of Christ be
baptized I'll just tell you straight up
there's nothing easy about the Christian
walk now listen to me even along the
path I just said you get to choose how
hard you want it to
be so not every Christian that's going
to heaven will that makes it from here
to there will have it as hard as the
others you get to
choose and you get to choose how deep
you will believe in the midst of
that it's your
call you get to do it but if you want to
make that step towards something hard
and not that easy stuff out
there repent of your sins confess the
name of Christ and be baptized and come
join on us why don't we stand and while
we
sing
