that's kind of different but that's fine
I wonder if I've got stuff up here yeah
I do wow that's a whole lesson right
there Robert S Arnold
uh I gotta be quick tonight Robert S
Arnold uh died in 2003 but he's uh a
shape note music publisher which is
wonderful for us because not everybody
is anymore
and you may not think this is important
but four part harmony may not be that
important but shape notes are important
and we need to maintain notes with our
singing or we won't be an acapella group
in the future
it won't be possible to maintain it
because you won't know the tune
it's essential that we have the notes
and shape notes if we want our four-part
Harmony
but he did 26 M's he was the singer and
he was a composer this Robert S Arnold
uh he had a singing school he's a
teacher in the senior School his cousin
might be somebody that you would know
he's a country western singer his name
was Eddie Arnold know the name now
Eddie Arnold but now Robert S Arnold was
inducted into the Texas Gospel Music
Hall of Fame on September the 14th 1985.
he is the author of the song no tears in
heaven
no tears in heaven no sorrow given all
will be glory in that land there'll be
no sadness all will be gladness when we
shall join that happy band The refrain
goes its way no tears in heaven Fair no
tears no tears up there sorrow and pain
will have flown
no tears in heaven Fair no tears no
tears up there no tears in heaven will
be
no
this all comes from the concept that we
just read in Revelation 21 which I don't
need to read again
but I think you need to understand that
Revelation 21 1-4 actually has an origin
and that origin isn't just the holy
spirit it's Isaiah 25. Isaiah 25 verses
89 says this
he will swallow up death forever
and the Lord God will wipe away tears
from all faces the rebuke of his people
he will take away from all the Earth for
the Lord has spoken and it shall be said
in that day behold This Is Our God we
have waited for him and he will save us
this is the Lord we have waited for him
we will be glad and rejoice in his
salvation
I'm a quick three points and I'll be
dying
tears that day God shall wipe away all
tears from their eyes
you may not realize that but that
implies a bodily Resurrection
First Corinthians 15 44 says it is sown
a natural body is raised a spiritual
body there's a natural body and there's
a spiritual body now I don't know
exactly what all that means but I do
know that if it's a spiritual body even
if it's a tangible or corporeal body
that means it'll be a body that doesn't
work against us it won't be a fleshly
body one that fights against God it'll
be one that supports God but the point
of First Corinthians 15 is clearly we
are bodily raised and we have eyes that
can cry
and God will wipe away those tears eyes
that can cry is the next point it says
the Lord well this is from Isaiah the
Lord God will wipe away their tears not
from their eyes as Revelation says but
from all faces so you'll have a face
so that's the important little concept
and I believe that just exactly it says
have no reason to doubt it some of you
got to go often to Never Never Land to
be happy but I'm not in Never Never Land
I just believe just like it says it
right there First John 3 verse 2 says
beloved now we are children of God and
it has not yet been revealed what we
shall be but we know that when he is
revealed we shall be like him for we
shall see him as he is so that implies
to me Jesus has a face if we have a face
that's got to be wiped away Jesus has a
face so it's beginning to feel a little
more normal isn't it either way there's
tears that day and we have eyes that cry
a final thought though is there's
another type of Tears
that we may continue to be able to have
and so the song no tears in heaven is
true
but maybe it's a bit overstated
because there's another type of Tears
and that is what he goes on to say in
Isaiah which is this is our God we have
waited for him I don't know just even
reading that just
gets me we have waited for have we not
have we not
we have waited for him and he will save
us
this is the Lord that's capital L
capital O capital r capital D
we have waited for him
we will be glad
and rejoice in that day there's another
type of tear
but those tears don't need to be wiped
away
the New Living Translation translates
Jeremiah 31 9. tears of joy will stream
down their faces and I will lead them
home with great care they will walk
beside quiet streams on smooth paths
where they will not stumble for I am
Israel's father
that sounds so good to me will there be
Tears in Heaven yes but no sorrow is
given it will be the Blessed tears
because your eyes can cry you have a
face you have tear ducts and your eyes
can cry but you won't be crying from
sorrow ever again
but you could cry from tears of joy that
don't need to be wiped away
sounds pretty good to me then even the
wedding everybody cries at a wedding
especially the father
of the Bride
no tears in heaven so I believe that
there are tears there
now I'd agree I had three great aunts
and I'll end it with this I had three
great aunts and great ants because
well they were just old and anyway so
great ants they lived across the road
from my house as I grew up so I grew up
there my grandmother was on the other on
the other side of the road as well my
great aunts over there my uncle's over
here so it was at an intersection that
was known dutton's Crossing get it
figure that out so we lived out in the
country pretty good ways out in the
country and so my aunt since I was the
smallest in the family and the youngest
in the family
I was around longer in their later life
than anybody and so it was kind of my
duty to check on everybody every day
especially during the summertime I
checked on everybody every day so I
checked on my great aunts and checked on
my grandmother I checked on my uncle and
his family I checked on him every day
among the tasks I had to do that was one
of the things I kind of did so I went
and I've spent
I don't know probably two or three years
worth of time at my great aunt's house
and they would tell me all kinds of
stories from way back in the day when
they rode mules y'all didn't do that but
they rode mules and they had wagons and
they told me all kinds of stories
well then they were there three of them
there was frema
charity and Bell okay
frema that's her whole name charity was
charity Lou partheeni
and Bale was Arbella Rochella but the
oldest was just frema
f-r-e-m-a frema frema or it might be two
e's I'm not 100 on that
she was different
and when I say she was different now
they were they were teachers they were
retired teachers School arms never
married
you know and they taught so guess what
my English got corrected all the time
I about couldn't say anything that they
weren't correcting my English not that I
speak badly or but I do so
Prima the reason I told you that all of
that is so you get a context of Fremont
when frema was a was a teenager probably
about 12. the mules got scared by
something and she was sitting in in the
in the wagon
they got scared by something and I don't
know what it was and it took off and she
couldn't get control
and it bucked her out she had her head
on a rock
she never cried again
she could not cry
no tears would come out
since she never cried
she will
but not the kind that we thought
even my frema
my aunt Freeman will cry again tears of
joy
I truly believe
the greatest thing is the tears of joy
that won't be wiped away in heaven
because you will have a face you will
have eyes you do have tear ducts you
will have all those things or God
couldn't wipe away your tears so you
will wipe away your tears of Sorrow
but not to tears of joy they will flow
forevermore
Great Moments in worship when we all
lift our voices Millions upon millions
billions and then the angels and how
many of them there might be as we all
lift our voice in one chorus
you won't be able to make it through
without tears of joy
the first song
I look forward to seeing frema cry
yeah
why would you want to miss that if
you're not right with God I want to give
you an opportunity if you'll come while
we stand alone we sing
