Amen.
&gt;&gt; Isaiah 5 and verse 20 says this, "Woe to
those who call good evil
and evil good. Who put darkness for
light and light for darkness, who put
bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter."
But Charles Spurgeon said something a
little different. He said this, and I
thought this was interesting. He said,
"Discernment
is not knowing the difference between
right and wrong. It is knowing the
difference between right and almost
right."
That might be the most important thing
that we learn today. If we can learn it,
there are a lot of things that are
thought about people who go to church. I
would say that over 50% and I I hate
this is true, but over 50% of the people
in America are either in their beds or
on a sporting event right now
or watching TV. They're not in church.
Worldwide, it's worse than that.
It's a remnant who are dedicated enough
to be at church on a Sunday morning,
even sporadically, little less every
Sunday.
You are the unique, but you are thought
to be the fools.
You could still be in bed right now.
You could be at a breakfast.
You could be at a sporting event.
You could be teeing off at a golf
course.
You could be on a vacation, laying on a
beach somewhere.
There's a lot of things you could be
doing.
Here's the thing. There are things
unbelievers believe to be true that are
not true.
I don't know how they got to the point
that they could believe these things,
but they're simply not true.
They believe that something came from
nothing and yet they do not believe that
miracles can be.
They believe that life came from
non-life and yet they say they don't
believe in miracles.
They say that order came out of chaos
and yet they say they do not believe in
miracles.
They say that morality came from matter
and yet they say they do not believe in
miracles.
They say complexity came from entropy.
And yet they say they do not believe in
miracles. We're fools because we do
believe in miracles.
Isn't that peculiar?
Truth.
Here's more. There are things that
scientists believe to be true
but cannot be true.
Science can describe brain function
but cannot explain how physical
processes create subjective experiences
like you and I are having at this very
moment.
They have no ability to do that. But
it's got to be true.
Science can describe the operation and
the framework of reality but cannot
answer the ultimate of why the universe
exists. There is no why. They will say,
"Well, that doesn't make any sense."
Science can describe the universe with
mathematical laws and logic, but cannot
prove the inherent truth or why they
perfectly describe it. How in the world
could there be math? How in the world
could it describe it so logically? And
does it make any sense if we're an
accident?
Science can do a lot of things and I
won't go through the rest of them. I'm
simply saying I'm a real believer in
science, but I don't believe science can
tell you how we got here.
That's the truth that they don't want to
admit. But here's the thing. The world
thinks we're fools because we don't
believe those things. Now, isn't that
interesting?
Good is called evil and evil is called
good.
Light is called darkness and darkness is
called light. I want to talk about the
truth. When we get to the subject of the
Bible now, so the Bible claims to be not
a truth or containing truth. The Bible
is the truth, not some of it. It is the
truth that matters. the only real truth
that matters.
And there are many times and in many
ways the Bible says this. Look at the
different ways that it says it. It says
God's judgments are truth. God's
commandments are truth. God's works are
truth. God's laws are truth. God's word
is truth. And it says it over and over
and over and over again.
You know, there's many types of truth,
but there's still truth. There's
religious truth, that is the knowledge
of God. If you don't know God, you don't
know truth.
There is moral truth. If you can't tell
what's right and what's wrong, you don't
know truth. There's prophetic truth, the
impossible knowledge that's contained in
the scriptures that foretell all that
happened with Jesus alone. If you don't
understand that concept, you don't know
the truth. Consistent truth that 40
authors over 1500 years could possibly
write a document that we could now look
at thousands of years later and know it
guides our lives. And yet it's truth.
And if you don't know that, you don't
know truth. There's symbolic truth of
all the allegorories, all the metaphors
in the scriptures that teach us how to
live. proverbial truth. That's the
wisdom. And how we figure out that right
actually works. There are actually
things contained in the Bible that you
can look at the other way, but you're
being foolish if you don't do what it
says because it will keep you out of all
kinds of trouble. And we try to ignore
that truth. And yet it is truth. There
is the truth of historical truth. They
want to try to make you believe that the
Bible cannot be proved. But every single
event, every single action is
historically accurate and every place is
exactly where it says it was. And you
say, "Well, how do you know that?"
Because I spent a lifetime looking at
it. Because of all people on the planet,
I'm trying to find a problem with it.
And I'm not finding it. Everything's
where it says it was. Everything
happened when it says it happened. And
historic historically, it keeps coming
back. That's what happened. That's what
happened. That's where it happened.
That's what happened. Then there's
scientific truth. There's events
discussed in the Bible that could not
possibly be known by people in the
primitive 1500 BC. Couldn't poss
there's infallible truth of how Jesus
rose from the dead. It's so obvious. If
you don't believe it, look at Saul. How
could Saul go from being against him to
being for him? How could James, the
brother of Jesus, ever believe his own
brother could be the savior of the
world? Come on. Nobody would believe
that about your own brother.
And yet there it is. There's textual
truth. The accuracy and the veracity of
all the scriptures we have. Oh well,
there's no documentation. Let me tell
you a book that has no documentation.
The Quran.
200 years passed before we have it
documented. But the scriptures are up to
date from 50 AD. And besides that,
there's 25,000 texts of the New
Testament alone.
25,000.
Don't tell me it's not documented.
So maybe men do not believe. And listen,
so I'm going to shift gears now. I've
just said a bunch of stuff. I'm g
totally shift gears.
Maybe men do not believe because of
evidence because I just laid it out
there. And those things are absolutely
true. And everything I just said is 100%
the truth. And yet that will not cause
people to believe. You know how I know
it? Because it isn't.
It isn't.
They're still laying in their beds this
morning.
It isn't. So, evidence, science,
surveys, philosophy doesn't do it. I
want to talk to you about about five
ways that I believe people end up
believing. And if you'll recognize this,
you can help people come to Christ.
Number one,
the truth is found in Epiphany.
Listen to this text. John 8:28.
Then Jesus said to them, "When you lift
up the Son of Man,
then you will know."
An epiphany is a manifestation.
Paul saw Jesus.
And here's what happens.
If you're honest and you're watching
what's happening around you, there will
be a moment when you will go,
"Huh?
Huh?
I saw God change my family."
Huh.
I've seen God answer prayers.
Huh?
That's a aha moment, an epiphany.
That gets people's attention if you'll
pay attention to it. The second thing,
the truth is found in positivity.
Listen to what he goes on to say. Verse
29. And he who sent me is with me. The
father has not left me alone. Listen the
statement. For I always do those things
that please him.
The message itself
is so positive.
It is constructive.
It makes life bearable.
I can sleep at night.
This message helps me sleep.
I can have friends with anybody.
It helps me get beyond any barrier.
It is so positive. It gives me
inspiration to take the next step. And
if you haven't recognized that, you
haven't looked at it very closely.
It is the most positive thing in the
world. People look at this and a it's
negative. It makes tells people we're
not supposed to. Let me tell you, this
is the most positive document on the
planet.
Positive makes it possible to take the
next step.
If you see it, you got to believe it.
Number three,
the truth is found in stability. We know
this is true because of the stability it
offers. John 8:es 30 and 31. And he
spoke these words. Many believed in him.
Just words. And they believed. Why? Then
Jesus said to the Jews who believed him,
"If you abide in my word,
you're my disciples indeed."
Here's the truth.
This little thing right here is the
reason we have countries
that work.
Without the influence of this little
thing right here, you and I are in
chaos.
This is the only reason the world's as
stable as it is.
It is the stabilizer of the world. It's
the stabilizer of your home. If your
home's falling apart, this hasn't been
paid attention to very closely.
You pay attention to this, your your
home will work. It will work. You got
trouble with your husband, your wife, go
read it again. Do what it says. It will
stabilize your home. You're having
trouble at work, read it. It will
stabilize what you're doing at work.
You're having trouble. I'm seriously do
what this thing says. Amazing how it
stabilizes everything. And if you don't
recognize that, you're a bit of a fool.
Because only a fool would look at what
would make your life better and keep you
safer and ignore it and say, "I don't
need that. I don't need to read that. I
don't need to pay attention to that." It
stabilizes everything. It makes us firm
and I can go on and I don't fear or
worry.
Number next,
the truth is found in clarity. Look at
verse 32. and you shall know the truth.
Not hope it's true. I don't hope the
Bible's true. I'm not guessing it's
true.
I'd like to get an amen. I know it's
true.
I don't think it's true. I know it's
true.
It's true.
The gospel is true. Christ is true. You
shall know the truth and the truth shall
set you free. It's an understanding. I
understand it. Once you understand it
and what God has done in Christ, there's
no going back. You can't abandon it. You
know what the truth is. This is like
Aladdin's lamp. The harder you rub it,
the more it shines. You want to check it
out, check it out. You want to look it
up and see if there's wreck could
possibly be true. You dig in. Dig in, my
friend. Dig in. I've dug in for 50
years. Dig in. I have looked at it
harder than most of you will ever even
think about looking at it. And I'm
telling you straight up, it's true. It's
true. It's true. Every page. Is it true?
Is Genesis 1 true? It's true. Is
Revelation true? It's true. It's all
true. It's every word of It's true.
And you end up knowing it's true. If you
don't know it's true this morning, you
know why? You had looked at it. Hadn't
looked it.
Number five, the truth is found in
liberty.
Liberty.
This brings liberty to the world.
There's no slavery today because of
this.
And I say no slavery. No slavery in the
United States. There's 40 million slaves
in the world today. And I think it's
disgusting that we don't think anything
about the other 40 million. But
nonetheless, no slavery in America
because finally the Bible actually had
its way with us. That's the real truth.
John 8:32, "And you shall know the truth
and the truth shall set you free or make
you free." It it isn't about slavery
though. I don't mean it. I was just
using that as example. It's not that.
Here's the truth.
It gives us freedom to not agree.
You hear me? The Bible doesn't confine
me to do what you think I must do.
The Bible sets me free to do what he
says I must do. I don't have to make you
happy. You don't like what I believe?
Doesn't matter.
I don't like what you believe. Doesn't
matter. It's not about you and me. It's
about him.
He sets us free. And the one thing I
know is if your religion manipulates
you, you haven't found freedom yet. If
you can't disagree at church, you're in
the wrong church.
If you can't sit down and say, "I don't
know if I think that's right." You know
why? Because liars try to manipulate you
to say it the way they say it. To
control you the way you think. That's
what liars do. Because they can't allow
you to think. If you start thinking, you
don't find out they're lying to you. But
here, you get to think because you just
got to agree with him, not me. Amen.
Just agree with him, not me. I You don't
have to agree with me.
Freedom that that is, that is such a
freedom. You may not realize how great
that is. That's such a freedom to be
able to walk in here. You can go into a
Bible class. Some of you won't be in one
this morning, but you can go into a
Bible class if you were grown up enough
to go to a Bible class. If you go into a
Bible class, here's what you'd find. You
can have an opinion.
What a thought. How in the world could
that be true and yet the truth be a
thing? Because the truth set you free.
See, now there there it is. It's a
simple little concept. See, it isn't all
that scientific evidence stuff. It's not
all the philosophy. It's not all the
arguments I give. Listen to me. Here it
is. This is the reason 99% of us all
believe we've had an epiphany. We've
experienced God. We've experienced the
positivity of the message. We've learned
the stability it brings to our life. We
see clarity in it because the more you
dig into it, the clearer it becomes. And
we see the liberty that it has brought
to us and the worldwide.
There it is. That didn't come from a
man. That came from God. Only God could
do that. So the change in your
experience and the change you see in
other people become the real evidence.
There's the real evidence. And if there
hasn't been a change in you, that's
evidence, too.
Don't trust proofs of service.
Don't trust scientists or groups of
scientists. You know, you don't trust
scientists. Not a lick of them. I don't
have trust scientists. I trust science.
I don't trust scientists. Scientists
just people. They lie to you just like
everybody else. Any anybody to lie.
You can pay people to say stuff. People
can be proud and say things that they
have no ability to prove. And they can
look for prestige. So, there's all kinds
of reasons people will lie to you.
So don't trust proofs.
Let me give you an example.
There are phony, if you don't know this,
you're going to find out if you go out
to eat today. There are phony hotel and
res uh restaurant reviews. Did you know
that? If you look on the internet and
you're going to pick a restaurant today
because the reviews between 16 and 40%
of all the reviews of any restaurant and
any hotel is a lie.
They are being generated by AI. They're
being generated by competition. They're
being gen in fact it's being paid to be
done. Did you know that they are paying
people to give positive reviews? But
worse, the competition when you find a
negative review, it often also is a lie
because their competition is paying for
negative reviews of their competition.
And so much so that now the government
is getting involved on and the Wall
Street Journal carried a whole story
about this, how that they you come up
with several different ways of trying to
figure out whether or not it's a real
review or not a real view. A couple of
them was you have to look at the
picture, you avoid the extremes, check
the timing of the reviews. There's
different things you can do, but there's
literally a Federal Trade Commission
looking into it. Going to start, they're
passing laws. They're going to start
trying to put people in jail for giving
falsified reviews of restaurants and
hotels because it's so prevalent. Here's
what that all means to me. You can't
trust what people are saying.
You can't trust that. So, don't trust
everything an authority says. Oh, well,
I went to a university. They taught me
this in a university.
Well, the government says, "Well, now we
really know it's true, right?"
Really? Susan and Darby Nye of
Arlington, Virginia. Been married 30
years. Let me tell you how trustworthy
the government is.
They're retiring.
Susan, they're retiring. Married 30
years. Susan started receiving
condolences from various federal
agencies regarding the death of her
husband Darby.
Problem was Darby was alive and well.
It started when Darby's purchase of a
pharmacy at a pharmacy was declined.
Uh and he tried to find out why. They
said, "Well, they said the Social
Security Administration has informed us
that you are dead." That's what they
told him as he's standing there.
It's estimated, just show you how safe
the government is. It's estimated that
12,200 are declared dead by the Social
Security Administration every year due
to keystroke mistakes.
The dead
because of social security can't get a
job, can't make a bank transaction,
can't file their taxes, can't visit a
doctor,
and they can't convince the bureaucracy
of the truth that they're still alive.
It's almost impossible. Oh, you can
trust. You can trust. You can trust.
There is something you can trust. It's
been checked out for about 2,000 years
now. There's something you can trust.
But I'm going to tell you what you
really can trust. You can trust your
experience
and the change that you have experienced
and the change you've seen in others.
You can trust that because that's real
evidence. That's evidence. That's real.
I've lived through that evidence. I know
that's real. Many believe
similarly that you know their stuff is
real.
But let me tell you what I do know is
that epiphany
that's real. That positivity
that's real. That stability
that's real. That clarity
that's real. That liberty
that's real. If you're here today, you'd
like to experience it, we'll walk you
through it. You can repent of your sins,
confess the name of Christ, be baptized
today. Not because I said it, because
it's here and it's real. If you want it,
why don't you come while we stand and
while we sing?
