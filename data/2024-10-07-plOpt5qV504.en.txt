the Soul's comestibles that's the word
for an item of food I just us a fancy
word basically I'm trying to suggest you
idea that church feeds us I really
believe that's true it feeds our soul
especially when you're
hurting American Bible Society though
reported in 2002 a little disturbing it
says Jane uh Jane John plaque wrote this
we reviewed our calculations we double
checked our math and we ran the numbers
again and again what we discovered was
startling disheartening and disruptive
in
2021 50% of Americans roughly said that
they read their Bible on their own at
least three or four times a year that's
not a lot but that's 50% of Americans at
least three or four times a year that
stayed steady until 2011
it had been like that for a long time in
2022 it dropped 11 points to
39% that means 13 million people stop
reading their Bible three or four times
a
year and that's where we stand right now
we need to be fed my
friend and the only way I know to be fed
is to go where the food is and to get it
attendance at all church services has
dropped some as well during this
period um so I'm I'm concerned because
sentiment I believe has shifted for some
from a gladness I think they're used to
be a gladness about going to church I
really do and I don't know what to do
about it but I know Psalm has said
things about it Psalm 122:1 said I was
glad
when they said to me let us go into the
house of the Lord but I think for some
it's now weariness Malachi talks about
this you say oh what a weariness and you
sneer at
it the sentiment has shifted for some
from I'm coming to be
fed Psalm 23:5 you prepare a table
before me
to I'm not being fed at church
Ezekiel 34:8 the Shepherds feed
themselves and did not feed my
flock the sentiment has shifted from
some who from attendance being respected
as an activity it used to be if you saw
people dressed on a Sunday headed to
church even the people not go and
respected
it 1 Corinthians 10:31 whether you eat
or eat or drink do all to the glory of
God and now it seems that it went from a
glory to God
to almost almost a forbidden
activity the enlightened considers you a
fool to be
here 1 Timothy 4:3 commanding to abstain
from foods which God created to be
received with Thanksgiving by those who
believe I know that's talking about
literal food but it's also talking about
the other kind of food but the world
would not want you to be here the world
does not want you
here it does not want you to hear the
word of
God sentiment has shifted for some from
attending to hear and have more faith
Romans 10:17 faith comes by hearing and
hearing by the word of God or the word
of Christ it shifted now to what Paul
talks to Timothy about to a large degree
now second Timothy 4:3 it says they will
not endure sound or healthy
Doctrine but they will turn their ears
away and turn aside the
fables we who attend all the services of
the church we will still
try hurricane or no
hurricane to not be dissuaded from the
path for those wondering why we attend
all the church services let me give you
four reasons today that relate directly
to your
feeding and I believe that you know at
moments like this listen to me at
moments like
this you know you need a little
something we
attend all services to be continually
devoting ourselves to
teaching that's what it says New
American Standard I'm going to read from
this morning they were continually
devoting themselves to the apostles
teaching why is that why would you be
continually doing it not just one day
but every chance you get why would you
do that because teaching for those who
actually are aware it's like
milk 1 Peter 2:2 as newborn babes desire
the pure milk of the word that you may
grow thereby now you may think that that
meant that Peter was addressing them as
newborn
babes no that's not necessarily what's
happening there he's not necessarily
saying they were new in the faith he's
saying that that's the way you should
desire
it you should desire the word like you
were a newborn babe and like that was
the most important thing in your world
what can you do for a baby who's hungry
other than feed them they're not
happy and teaching is like our bread
Matthew 4:4 says but he answered and
said it is written man shall not live by
bread alone Keegan made reference to
this a moment ago but by every word that
proceeds from the mouth of God it's like
our bread I know nowadays gluten is the
big thing but there are very few people
that don't eat bread because it's like a
staple right fills you up when nothing
else will and teaching is like our meat
and everybody I think likes meat 1
Corinthians 3:2 says I have fed you with
milk and not with meat for hitherto you
were not able to Bear it neither yet now
are you able so the truth is is that
there's part of this that's more like
milk
and bread and then some of this is like
meat and you have to chew on it a little
while so we attend all services to be
continually devoting that's the idea why
are you doing it well acts
two what did they
do they continually devoted themselves
to the teaching so I think soul food you
want talk about soul food and by the way
I like soul food what we call real soul
food you give me some turn of greens and
collards I'm good man I'm telling you
but straight
up this is your soul food
teaching teaching that's your Soul's
food number two we attend all services
to be continually devoting ourselves to
fellowshipping in Acts 2:42 goes on to
say they were continually devoting
themselves to the apostles teaching and
to
Fellowship what's Fellowship like
Fellowship
is like our
friendship these are my
friends not
those
these second 2 Kings 10:15 I'm going use
this text kind of interesting way verse
15 says when he departed from there he
met uh jonadab the son of
RAB coming to meet him and he greeted
him and said to him is listen to these
words is your heart right as my heart is
toward your heart and John deab answered
it is is your heart right like my heart
is right toward you that's Fellowship
Fellowship that's true
fellowship and it's a
friendship that's not like anything else
out
there this is different fellowshipping
is like our
companionship we go through things
differently than we go through things
with anybody else on this planet he goes
on to say in 15 he says Jus
said if it is in other words if your
heart is really there with my heart give
me your
hand exactly that's what we want here
right at right hand so he gave him his
hand and he took him up to him into the
Chariot then he said come with me and
see my Zeal for the Lord so they had him
ride in the Chariot we're in this thing
together that's what real Fellowship is
it's a companionship
and fellowshipping is like our
comradeship what do I mean by that we
are in the same War
together there's a war raging against
our soul he goes on to talk about it in
that same text I'm just using this a
parallel verse 17 and when he came to
Samaria he killed all who remained of
Ahab in Samaria till he had destroyed
them according to the word of the Lord
which he spoke to Elijah come see what
I'm doing and then when he got there he
says watch and he kills all these see
what he's saying is we're on the same
side in this
war and that's true my brethren so we
attend all service to be continually
devoting ourselves to fellowshipping
which what which is one of the ways that
feeds our soul it's truly our soulle
food fellowshipping there is nothing
like a right hand when you're not doing
so well and you come in this building
amen there is nothing like that when
your world has been
shaken and you walk in this building and
we sing the same words
together number
three we attend all services to be
continually devoting ourselves to
communing it goes on to say they were
continually devoting themselves to the
apostles teaching and to fellowship and
to to the breaking of bread probably
referring directly to communion because
it uses the article the in the Greek
making it interesting communing is like
our exercise we're exercising when we
come here we take communion it does
something for us you may not realize
this 1 Corinthians 11 says this it says
for this reason many are weak if they're
not communing properly
if you're not taking communion on a
regular basis properly it makes you weak
it's the same as if you didn't
exercise if you do nothing if you just
sit and you become a vegetable I assure
you you're losing strength every day you
got to do something to keep your
strength up this is like exercising it
will make
is like our healing it goes 1
Corinthians 11:30 the great passage on
communion for this reason many are weak
and sick not only will you be weaker if
you don't take communion with us you may
be sick now it's not talking about
necessarily physical sickness here he
talking about healing though and that it
offers you a healing if you're sick and
I don't mean physically sick but I'm
telling you there are a lot of spiritual
sickness es that would be made well if
you just showed up every Sunday and took
the Lord's supper with us and communed
with us and then also communion is like
our waking it goes on to say for this
reason many are weak and sick among you
and many sleep some think that refers to
death it may refer to spiritual death I
don't know but when we take communion
it's like a wakeup call for us all
the
bread the breaking of the bread but I
think this has a greater meaning than
just that because if you read the whole
context of Acts chapter 2 you see they
eat from house to house so I think it
probably did refer to the communion of
the bread that we have at the table but
I think it also refers to the idea of
just wanting to be with each other and
eating with each other and the strength
we gain from that kind of community so
communion with brethren
is soul
food nothing like it number
next we attend all services to be
continually devoting ourselves to
praying it says and they were
continually devoting themselves to the
apostles
teachings and to Fellowship to the
breaking of bread and to
prayer praying is like our
protection right
now we just prayed about
Milton
why you know why you feel safer after
you've done it don't you amen amen walls
yeah acts 4 verse
29-31 now Lord look on their threats and
Grant to your servant that with all
boldness they may speak your word what's
changed we just praying for boldness by
stretching out your hand to heal and
that signs and wonders may be done
through the name of your holy servant
Jesus and when they had prayed the place
where they were assembled together this
is an assembly of the Lord assembled
together was shaken and they were all
filled with the Holy Spirit and they
spoke the word of God with boldness
there is something about prayer that
will make you
bold it'll make you
unafraid so when the storm comes on
Wednesday
most of us will be throwing them
up and you know what you'll be bolder
than you would have been otherwise so
together we do that and it makes us more
powerful and praying is it's not only
like our protection praying is like our
passion I love the 1 Thessalonians 5:17
pray without ceasing that just refers to
the idea of praying should be a
Perpetual thing th the continual thing
thus the reason we need to be together
as often as we can thus the reason that
we assemble every opportunity to pray
together the number one thing we do here
is Prayer by the way singing is praying
communion is praying listening to a
sermon you may not be aware of this but
listening to a sermon is
praying everything we do is praying
maybe announcements are questionable but
everything else we do is praying it is a
way that we're communing with God it's
meditating on God it's thinking on God
and in the middle of a sermon if you're
really listening to a sermon and not
just listening the way you know you're
not really paying but if you're really
listening here's what you do every now
and then you stop listening which is
what you should do stop
listening and pray about what was just
said yeah that's what happens that's
what happens Lord I I need to think
about that I need to work on that one I
need to do something about that yes and
praying is like not only our passion
because we do it all the time but
praying is like our profession it's like
the duty of the kingdom of God it's like
we are the priesthood Because by the way
we are the priesthood of God now on
Earth and Hebrews 13:15 says therefore
by him let us that is the priesthood of
God continually offer the sacrifice of
praise to God that is the fruit of our
lips giving thanks to his name we are
the Priestly tribe who it's our job to
pray it is not just something was nice
to do it's our job the world needs us to
pray today Florida needs us to pray
today we need us to pray today so we
attend all service to be continually
devoting ourselves to praying which is
like the Soul's comestibles it's
basically our soul food what does I what
is it that my soul needs to eat more
than anything else to make me healthy I
need to be in teaching I need to hear
somebody teach me I go to Bible classes
just like you do I need it I need
somebody to teach me I need to hear
because if you get off by yourself like
kind of I do and study by yourself all
the time you can go so weird off in a
weird Direction you don't know you need
people inputting and you think you can
go home and study and you're just as
good as if you would BR here no my
friend I'm telling you the best way to
be sound is to listen to what other
people are saying in a Bible class and
be studying all the time so teaching is
my food fellowshipping is my food to put
a hand out when I'm doing bad and I'm
not handling things if I'm sinning or if
I'm just struggling within because of
hurts within me I need to see your face
you may think your face doesn't matter
you may not even think you look that
great but I'm telling you it doesn't
matter what you look like when I'm
struggling on the onside just to see
another Soul at church lifts me up amen
and if it's just you and me I'm telling
you I'm better off for seeing
you fellowshipping communing that plate
passing in front of me may look like all
that just some right that's not useful
to anything that's the most important
thing I do every
week it's the most critical thing in my
spiritual
walk a piece of bread how could that be
like that how could a little cup of
juice do that I don't know my friend but
I'm telling you it's the most important
thing I do every week amen and it makes
a huge difference and then praying and
being here and hearing you know one of
the greatest things I love I love to
hear you guys lead
prayer cuz you pray differently than I
do thank the Lord and I hear things that
I'm like I I didn't even think about
praying that it didn't didn't even occur
to me to pray what you
prayed and I it's one of the reasons I
love the diversity of this church cuz
when I hear somebody praying from a
different cultural background and they
say something differently then I would
have said I'm blown away I'm like oh God
I never in my life thought of saying it
like
that so
yes but I simply do not want to come
Sunday night or Wednesday night well I
don't want to come this Wednesday
night it's not surprising that people
wouldn't want to
come but it may surprise you that it
says something about you
attendance May relate mainly to personal
tastes I I just got to be real honest
can I be real honest for a
minute I don't think you don't come
because you don't like
it but I do think there is something to
personal taste you know the United
States of America they say is one of the
best places in the world for
food do you know that I say we have a
more variety of food here than anywhere
in the world so yeah I'm not saying
Florida is I'm saying United States of
America is just think about the things
we have apple pie that's good stuff is't
it apple pie with ice cream how about a
Alaskan king crab you ever had Alaskan
king crab that's good stuff amen how
about New York hot dogs that's good
stuff folks uh how about bagels with
cream
cheese good stuff Ain it chocolate chip
cookies and then of course the kind of
chocolate chip cookies we have make
those chocolate chip cookies look
bad they're really awesome how about
Philly cheese
steak that's good is it uh how about
deep dish
pizza yeah and then of course there's
all that junk stuff that I like it's
that's probably really bad for chips and
all that kind of we have really good
food did you know the pleasure of
Taste starts with you taste
buds but it really happens in
here a't that
weird when I'm eating what's happening
is in there did you know that it's kind
of a weird thing and it's not really
happening there it's happening in here
and what you may not have thought about
is that humans are not the only ones who
taste things did you know that did you
know a
catfish taste in the water
did you know that in fact they call a
catfish the swimming
tongue cuz whatever it swims through it
tastes on its skin its entire skin it's
like a taste bud and it tastes the water
around it but they're not the only ones
did you know
flies and spiders and fruit flies
have taste buds on their
feet did you know that so when they put
their foot down on something they taste
it it's like wow it's like a
snake taste the air with its tongue
waggling around we're not the only ones
that taste things have you ever seen a
squirrel in the
yard what's he do and he'll put it in
his mou
he's tasting it he's discovering the
parts he really
likes it's not just us but
taste is pretty
neat it's a
gift Psalm 34:8 oh taste and see that
the Lord is
good if you never attended a
restaurant if you haven't gone there
long enough let's say you've gone there
before and he didn't like it but I don't
know if you know this but they're just
like us some days they have good days
and some days they have bad
days I bet you've eaten at home and
thought boy she's cooking that again I
love that stuff that's just okay tonight
what's
wrong on the other hand you go wow that
was so good tonight right restaurants
are kind of the same way occasionally
believe it or not it's better than it is
at other times maybe if you just went
back you might find out you just had a
bad day but more than that restaurants
are kind of interesting you know just
because somebody else says I went to
that restaurant and I didn't like it
ignore that their taste buds might be
totally different than yours you what
you like and what they like it's two
different things or maybe you go back
just to discover what you're missing
maybe I'll get something else on that
menu you know try something else cuz
maybe it was just that that I don't care
for
right think think about in light of a
church Proverbs 27:7 says A Satisfied
soul loves the honeycomb but to a hungry
Soul ever bitter thing is sweet I don't
have you ever really been hungry I
remember when we were getting ready to
go to Africa we were selling everything
we had and we got down to the last
little bit we basically sitting on
church chairs at the house we got rid of
everything okay and the day that we sold
the last little bit we worked with our
friend and we sold everything that day
but it we started early in the morning
and we went to like 4:00 in the
afternoon but finally it was all gone
and everything was gone and we said we
got some money in our pocket now that we
sold everything why don't we go out to
eat so we went to Red Lobster I don't
like Red
Lobster that was the best food I've ever
eaten my life we didn't have breakfast
that day we didn't have lunch that day
we got there and that was the best food
I've ever eaten in my life so
maybe you just been full of other
things one who is hungry wants to attend
and will love the services if you're
really hungry Matthew 5 and verse6
blessed are those who hunger for
righteousness one who is full doesn't
want to attend and will loathe any
service because Isaiah 5 verse 20 says
woe to those who put bitter for
sweet Personal Taste can change
though you know I don't know I bet you
remember this I bet there was a time
when there's food that you eat now and
you like that you used to not
like have you noticed that that happens
some things when you were a kid yck I'm
not eating that right but now you love
it Galatians 1 verse 23 he who formerly
persecuted us now preaches the faith
which he once tried to destroy Paul
changed his taste 1 Timothy 1:13 I was
formerly a blasphemer a persecutor and
an insolent man but I obtained Mercy you
know I think it's childish I'm going to
tell you something I think's really
childish to not like something you've
never
tasted I think that's really
childish that looks yucky you never had
it how do you
know right so I don't want to come
Sunday night yucky Wednesday night yucky
Sunday school yucky I got other thing
you never tried it how would you
know well I tried it once well I went to
a restaurant one time and I didn't care
for it and I went back and another time
and I liked it just fine maybe it was
just in the wrong class at the wrong
time you know what I mean by that folks
maybe we're acting like children maybe
we need to grow up a little bit and
realize that we need this food and we
need to eat regularly if you're here
today and you haven't given your life to
the Lord Jesus this is a great
opportunity I would recommend it in
light of what's coming this week but
that's your call why don't you come if
you need to while we stand while we sing
