does a person's name
matter does naming a child matter or are
we just coming up with
cutesies and it doesn't really matter
and we don't really care just naming a
thing
matter do we
care did you know our country has 18
doctors in America named
doctor so they are actually doctor
doctor we have another guy just one as
far as I know his name well he his name
is surgeon so he's Dr
surgeon there's a dermatologist named Dr
rash there's a psychiatrist named Dr
couch and there's an anesthesiologist
name Dr
gas names can be used abusively as epets
it could be not something positive it
can be designed to chip away at the
image that God has given to all of us
name calling uh is a terrible thing that
is in our world identity theft is
another big problem we're facing now
offenses uh come and go but really
ultimately when you defame someone's
name you have have defamed the Divinity
of humanity it's a form of blasphemy of
God but we don't tend to take it that
way you know slavery often took away a
person's name it replaced it with their
name to give power over the
individual sometimes it was replaced
simply because they couldn't pronounce
their real name
it was a different language but often it
was to put a person in their place and
to put them in their box so that they
had you defined we see that in Daniel 1
and verse 7 the chief of the Unix gave
names he gave Daniel the name of
belshazzar to hananiah Shadrach and
mishel uh they gave the name of uh
Shadrach meach and Abednego so they did
change their names that's a common way
of
degradation but names do matter as the
angel said to Joseph in a dream as he
thought about putting away Mary he said
of Mary in Matthew 1 verse 21 that Mary
will bring forth the
son and you shall call his name Jesus or
Yeshua for he will save his people from
the sin from their sins the name Jesus
is literally if you pronounce it
correctly and it's this is English
change from Greek but literally in the
Hebrew it' be Yeshua and it's the same
as the word for
salvation uh even though it's pronounced
the same it's Yeshua with an H on the
end of it uh so it wasn't to be
cute his name's not about God being cute
to give him muty name that we would
always
love uh actually Jesus is not even
appropriate to use that but we have no
other choice at this point because it's
so ingrained in our
culture but it was a revelation about
the child the child would be savior the
child would be salvation for the world
and that's the meaning of his name to
name a person or a thing is to manifest
the meaning and the value that God has
given it to know its coming from God to
know its place and function within the
world that God has created for it it is
to bless God with that name so we might
have slipped a few gears on the subject
of
names consider how
important name
is well if I could get it
right let me go one forward there we go
Genesis 1 and verse 5 God called the
light day what do you call it day stuck
didn't it God called the light day and
the Darkness he
called night stuck did didn't it so the
evening and the morning were the first
day Genesis
1:8 God called the firmament heaven so
the evening and the morning were the
second
day and then Genesis 1 and: 10 and God
called the dry land Earth same thing you
call it and the Gathering gather of the
water he called Seas same thing you call
it and God saw that it was good the name
stuck didn't it it really did
stick how about this one Genesis 219 out
of the ground the Lord God formed every
beast of the field and every bird of the
air and brought them to Adam to see what
he would call them and whatever Adam
called each living creature that was its
name likely the words we used to today
on all of these animals derived to some
degree from whatever he called them we
just don't know all the
atmology so in Genesis 2:23 it says and
Adam said this is now bone of my bones
and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be
called woman pay attention ladies
because she was taken out of man the
meaning of woman is not something
else so when somebody tells you what is
a woman here it is the one who was taken
out of
man that's what a woman is the one who
was taken out of man in Genesis 3 in
verse 20 though it says and Adam called
his wife's name Eve that's significant
ladies that's your name
too and Adam called his wife name e
because she was the mother of all living
it is a very significant name and it's
applicable to every one of you ladies
you might not have paid attention it's
also like today I mean we really got a
lot of crazy kind of talk about these
two subjects don't we the name Adam gave
her has deep and eternal significance
these are not just flippant Little
Things we throw around and act like they
don't matter they do matter and they
matter significantly Eve literally
signifying life the septu agent puts it
Life Spring so Eve means life or Life
Spring it's a substantive of a noun it's
a feminine it's not a feminine adjective
like the living one that's not what it
means it it mean doesn't mean the life
for one it doesn't mean that Eve means
life
life your wife your mother your sister
gentlemen that's
life
life and you'll see the significance of
that as we move along through here
that's not applied to
men it's applied to a
woman Adam's Faith after the fall is
displayed in he using that name it's not
an insignificant thing that he does this
it is very significant God doesn't
record stuff in his Bible that means
nothing okay God doesn't do stuff that
means
nothing okay so Adam's faith is
displayed after his fall into sin in
this text because his faith actually
remained intact and it's seen in the
naming with faith Faith so our text has
three messages to all mothers based upon
this naming and thus there are three
significant meanings of this naming her
evees let's see if we can observe
that by faith Adam called her name life
because she would give life to the
Christ and that's the Genesis 3:15 15
statement in our text and I will put
enmity that is division or dislike I
will put enmity between you that's the
devil that he's talking to and the woman
significant battle would happen between
the devil and the woman not the devil
and the man but the devil and the woman
and the woman would
win imity between you and the woman and
between your seed that is those that
follow Satan and her seed it's talking
about now a man because then he says he
shall bruise your head her seed would be
a he he shall bruise your head and you
shall bruise his heel which is the wound
that only happens in a certain kind of
killing of a man called a cross
Eve not Adam became the mother of
eternal life in Christ I didn't you
didn't gentlemen the woman became that
Hebrews 7: 9 and 10 says even Levi who
received tithes paid tithes through
Abraham so to speak for he was in the
loins of his father when MDC met him
that's a significant odd concept but it
is still true 1 Corinthians 15:22
references that kind of concept when it
says in Adam all die we were all in Adam
when he
sinned based upon that same concept in
Adam all die in you can say it
metaphorically too in Adam in a
spiritual metaphorical sense all die
even so in Christ all shall be made
alive
now Romans 5:12 says this as through one
man sin entered the world and death
through sin and thus death spread to all
men because all sin either directly
because they did wrong which is what all
of us do if we reach any age or as a
child even before birth because he was
in or she was in Adam when Adam sinned
as a result we are all worthy y of
death by faith Adam called his wife's
name Eve or life because she would
become the
lifegiving mother of eternal life found
in Christ so if there ever was an
appropriate name for woman because if
you live forever the only reason you
live forever is because woman gave birth
to the Christ
men don't do
that by faith Adam called her name life
because she would give life to Children
Genesis 3:16 the very next verse says to
the woman he said I will greatly
multiply your sorrow and your conception
so there had been no children born now
but suddenly in pain you shall bring
forth children and there isn't a woman
in the place that would doubt that in
pain you shall bring forth children but
the great part is the bringing forth of
the
children your desire shall be to your
husband and he shall rule over you
that's another discussion for another
day that's a part of your pain Eve
became the lifegiving mother of her own
children directly the one that that she
would hold in her lap the ones that she
would teach Little Things to that was
Eve's place that's your place life women
in Genesis 4: 1 beginning it says now
Adam knew Eve his wife that's not
talking about getting there knowwhere
that's talking about intimacy as you
well know if you've been in scriptures
at all now Adam knew his Eve his wife or
life Adam knew life his wife and she
conceived and bore Cain and said I have
acquired a man from the Lord verse two
then she bore again this time his
brother Abel now Abel was The Keeper of
the sheep but Cain was a tiller of the
ground dropping down to verse 25 of the
same chapter verse that's chapter four
if you're following and Adam knew his
wife again and she bore a son and named
him Seth for God had appointed another
seed for me instead of Abel whom Cain
killed so that's three boys we know
about right Genesis 5 and verse4 says
this after he begat Seth the days of
Adam were 800 years and he had sons and
daughters so we know he had more than
three sons and we know he had daughters
so she had many children we don't know
how many Deuteronomy 32 2:8 makes
reference to this when it says when the
most high divided their inheritance to
the peoples according to the numbers of
the children of Israel so literally
there were many such
children so in very real sense by faith
Adam called his wife's name Eve meaning
life because she would become the
lifegiving mother of her own children
the only the only reason you are here is
because of
that and let that seek into you right
now as the only reason you're
alive I'm not talking about your mother
now I'm talking about Eve is the only
reason you exist right
now that she had
children
by faith Adam called her name life
because she would give life to countless
children Genesis 3: 20 in the NIV it
says Adam named his wife Eve because she
would become the mother of all living
now I'll tell you the significance of
that she had not become the mother of
all living yet but she would become
become the mother of all living the easy
to read version puts it this way Adam's
name his wife Eve or life he gave her
this name because Eve would be the
mother of everyone who ever lived as a
very appropriate way to put it Eve
became the lifegiving mother of
literally countless
billions it's it's it's kind of odd to
think about it that we all came from one
woman how many Genesis 32:12 says M I'll
make your descendants this is to Abraham
I'll make your descendant as the sand of
the sea which cannot be numbered for
multitude that's definitely true of
Eve it's an unlimited number Adam named
his wife because Moses wrote this
passage and follow with me Moses wrote
Genesis 3 as he did Genesis Exodus
Leviticus Numbers in Deuteronomy he
wrote the pentiuk Moses is the author of
that through the power of the Holy
Spirit and maybe some emanu insis that
also helped in but nonetheless he wrote
that and so he's explaining this text
from his historical fulfillment that he
knew at a later date much later couple
of thousand years
later she became the mother of all
living because even though they had all
sinned and this is the really the
significant thing here maybe you haven't
picked up on this this is really the
Deep big
thing she became the mother of all
living in spite of the fact they had
eaten the tree and they deserved to
die now how many children has she
mothered because we are all her
children right we are all her children
every last one of us came from Eve you
want to make something of race think
about it just a second we all came from
Eve okay scientists try to tell us that
they think there's been aund 17 billion
humans so
far I think they're wrong but that's not
uncommon for me to disagree with them I
think it's probably closer to between 16
to 20 billion but I quibble over a
billion here or a billion
there to give a sense of how countless
that is let's count to a billion
one two
to count to a billion if I count one
number every second would take me 30
years but let's go to 16 billion which
is probably more in the case that would
take us
480 Years Around the
Clock to get to 16
billion well let's go to 117 billion
which is what the scientists try to tell
us that's 3,5 110 years to count there
let me just put it this way it's a
countless number now it what's amazing
is is all you duplicates are still
functional after that many
duplications that you function at all is
a
miracal so you go fussing about we got
problems I don't work all that good that
you function it all is a
miracle after that many duplications
that's a pretty neat system isin't it
God nearly KN looks like he knew what he
was doing doesn't it by faith Adam
called his wife's name Eve meaning life
because she would become the lifegiving
mother of literally countless
billions that's pretty interesting in it
I love that so the meaning of Eve by
faith here's what we see Adam de
demonstrating his faith at that moment
he called his wife's name Eve meaning
life because she would become the
lifegiving mother of the Christ and
thereby extending
life eternal life to
us because she would be the lifegiving
mother of her own
children has resulted also in her
becoming the lifegiving mother of the
countless billions that we
have that's a pretty impressive name now
isn't it don't you think her name is
appropriate
life so names really do
matter now you'll hear it today that
people are all confused what the word
woman
means but not if you read the
Bible amen not if you read the Bible
woman means you came from
man Eve approach for every
woman why because life flows through you
ladies not through
us life you're the
lifegiver appropriately
so the beginning of the third Century in
North Africa the persecution against
Christianity got really hot and heated
by Rome I mean it got really bad in
Carthage particularly it was
terrible per per petua is the name of a
lady who actually was of noble birth if
you will she had money they had money
and she was a mother she was even still
nursing one of her sons when she was
first incarcerated because she was a
Christian so her father who was not a
Christian went to see her in prison
began to beg her to renounce the name of
Christ to to renounce her Christianity
to say that she didn't believe why
because he said for the sake of our
family me and everybody what they're
going to think of us but more than that
for the sake of your family and more
than that for your own sake but more
than that for your little son who you're
having to nurse and you can't even get
to him hardly to take care of him right
now you should renounce it to save his
life perpetua answered there was a
picture sitting on a table and she said
this and by the way if you want to
question this you can look this up and
the her diary is quite extensive so this
comes directly from her
diary she said to her father father do
you see this vessel this picture
here you see it is a little
picture right or is it something
else
he looked over and he said yeah it's a
picture then perpetua said can it be
called by any other name than what it is
really and he said
no and she said neither can I call
myself anything else than what I am a
Christian and after that time in the
dungeon which was quite terrible if you
read the story she was put in a an
arena and she was killed by a
gladiator what was written after her
death is in her diary and it says this
perpetua that she might taste some pain
being pierced between the ribs with a
sword Cried Out loudly and she herself
placed the wavering right hand of the
youthful gladiator who shaking cuz he
really doesn't want to do
it she placed the right hand of the
youthful Gladiator to her
throat and helped him finish what he
started she would not deny the
name if you're a Christian you should
never deny it but be proud of it if
you're a disciple of Christ never deny
Christ if you're a woman ladies never
deny your Womanhood it is who you are
whether you think it is or not you came
from the
man but more than that if you are a
mother you are the life you're the life
of the family you're the life of the
world you are the life that brought
eternal life
Proverbs 10:7 says the memory of the
righteous is blessed but the name of the
wicked will
rot there are people who have done their
name
damage your name giving to you as a
child matters it may be simple but it
matters protect your name protect your
family name don't let it just just be
rotting away in somebody's mouth protect
it it matters it doesn't just matter
what your family name is it matters what
you were baptized in the name of in the
name of the father in the name of the
son in the name of the holy spirit that
matters it matters when you are baptized
for the remission of your sins in the
name of Jesus Christ it matters the name
matters who we honor matters we met here
this is a church
of
Christ it
matters it matters we must honor the
names
appropriately call yourself a Christian
or Disciples of Christ and be proud of
the
name if you're the last one in the whole
world disregards all of us Christians
stand proudly for the
name mothers be proud that you're a
mother don't be ashamed of the name
mother
mommy mom mama mother or whatever else
you're called wear it with pride it's
God's plan this isn't our plan we didn't
come up with this I didn't decide who I
was going to
be I Am What God made me you are what
God made you be proud of it God knows
what he's
doing now never deny the
name
life there you are
ladies
life that's who you
are so if you want eternal life that's
been provided by the way through Eve and
we're grateful for it's available in
Christ Jesus the one who gave his
life for you if you repent of your sins
confess the name of Christ you can be
his today won't you come if you need to
why don't we standing while we
sing
