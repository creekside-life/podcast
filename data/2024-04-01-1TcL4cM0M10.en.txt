back in
1992 A letter came from the health and
human services department to a resident
of Greenville County in South
Carolina this is what the letter the
lady receiv received
said your food stamps will be stopped at
the end of
March because we received notice that
you passed away
may God bless
you you may reapply If your
circumstances
change a family was watching a movie
about the life of
Jesus was on television there's been
many of them at this
point and their six-year-old daughter
was deeply moved by uh how realistic the
film was and how Jesus was being
portrayed and then of course his
crucifixion and death and how horrendous
that is to observe and really take in
tears ran down that little girl's face
as she looked at the cross and saw this
man dying and then being laid in a bored
tomb the reason that they a Bor tomb is
acceptable is because they would get it
back the Jews never left people in the
tombs like that they let them rot and
then they put them in an uary and they
buried this little box of an
uary that's why you could put a man in
your bar tomb and then use it yourself
later so they laid him in the bar
tomb and she this little girl watched as
a guard was set
then with a big smile it broke out on
her face and she bounced up on the arm
of the chair and great anticipation and
this is what she shouted now comes the
good
part that's
right she's 100% right the resurrection
of Our Lord changes
everything are there evidences
of a resurrection if you're one of these
people who want to see
facts maybe you want proof there may be
more proof around you than you've
realized let me take you to this are
there suggestive evidences of Jesus
resurrection just found in nature if you
just looked at nature for a moment is
there a suggestion that God may have had
a resurrection in mind all
alone well the resurrection is seen in
the spring when all our dormant plants
begin to wake up and burst forth in life
the resurrection is seen in a tree you
can cut a tree down and then it will
Sprout again and burst forth into a new
tree the resurrection is seen in what's
called a resurrection plant I actually
have a piece of a resurrection plant I
could take out right now I've had it for
30 something years I could take it out
of the book that it's in and put it in
water and that plant that is dry and
brittle and if you just touch it it will
break apart and if you put it in the
ground right now and water it it lives
in dehydration mode and will come back
again as dead as it is right now you
ever had sea monkeys some of you kids
said sea
monkeys you can let those sea monkeys
live in that little packet for over 30
years and drop them in the right
solution as long as they stay dry and
they will pop out again not all of them
will live but most of them will live and
those aren't actually monkeys they're
size egg stage of this creature and then
of course it's a shrimp of sort but then
Resurrection is seed seen in a seed just
a simple seed have you ever helped the
seed rot you take the seed and wet it
and you let it rot maybe put it in the
refrigerator or somewhere cool and it
begins to stink something awful is it's
dead it's rot and now it's perfect for
planting perfect but we don't normally
do it that way we normally put it the
ground let the ground do all that work
but you can do it that way and then
it'll burst forth with life so even in
nature there's suggestions that God had
something in mind all along but is that
the only place no there's suggestions in
history there's evidences of a
resurrection of Jesus Christ in history
itself the empty tomb by the way is real
they didn't put him in an uary he did
not write and that's opposed to David's
tomb which is mentioned in Acts 2 and
verse 29 and said that his his body is
still here with us even to this day
that's made reference in The Sermon on
the Mount I mean not Sermon on the Mount
sermon on Pentecost and then there's the
emergence of Sunday itself why are we
meeting on
Sunday what happened on
Sunday why would all the church churches
of the world meet on Sunday why would
you do it something happened that
changed the day of worship which was
Saturday Sabbath and then the
extermination of the Apostles why in the
world would 12 men allow themselves all
to virtually be killed why would you do
such a thing as that why would you put
yourself in Peril all those years and
preach a
resurrection and then there's the entire
New Testament 27 books
still here with
us how did that happen if everybody
around the thing knew that they could
prove it was a true how could that
happen how could it be and then there's
the existence of
you here you sit you're the
church how in the world did a a group of
people small little group 12 then about
120 be you thousand thousands of miles
away and the church still be going is
there
evidence well you're here aren't you I
think that's a little bit of evidence
but that's not what I want to focus on I
want to focus on today what I believe
are probably the three most convincing
testimonials in the New Testament and I
believe that they are undeniable I
believe that that it's so unlikely that
they would do this or that they would
lie about it it is so so unlikely that
there are the three most outstanding
examples of the fact that Jesus came out
of that tomb and then ascended back to
the father let's walk through them real
quickly number one the testimony of Paul
the unbelieving persecutor now somewhere
between
37 ad which would have been about four
years after the so-called resurrection
of Jesus Christ and to about 40 That's
somewhere in those numbers is where Paul
was likely reached by
somebody and then the latest that I want
to take you to is when he records what
he says in 1 Corinthians 15 that's about
57 ad but in Galatians around 40 ad
Galatians chap 1: 23 and 24 it says but
they were hearing only he was formally
person he who formerly persecuted us now
preaches the faith that he once tried to
destroy and they glorified God in Me
Paul writes this how in the world could
a man who's such a zealot such an
absolute Zealot for the cause of Judaism
suddenly go from actually killing and
imprisoning
Christians to preaching it knowing that
he could be killed by his fellow Jews
for doing it the story is recorded in
Acts 9 it's a great story there also in
Acts 22 Acts 26 records the story but in
1 Corinthians 15 1-11 he writes about it
himself and he says last of all he
appeared to me as one born out of De
seas and then 1 Timothy 1: 12-6 he says
I'm a pattern for you to believe I'm a I
was a persecutor I was an insolent man I
did everything against that
that cause that you now believe in he
says but I'm a pattern for everybody so
that everybody can once believe and do
what I did that's Paul the second one I
want you to see is not just Paul it's
James this one may be harder to deny
even than Paul because it's James the
unbelieving brother I don't know about
you there is no way on this Earth that
my brother would ever believe I was the
Messiah I promise you our experiences
together there is is this no way your
brother you know how it is you know how
we treat each other this is not possible
the way we talk to each other the way we
deal with each other but somewhere
between 45 and 48 ad which was a little
time after Paul was changed we know for
a fact this is written Mark 6: 3 and 4
it says this is this not the carpenter
the son of Mary and the brother of James
Joseph Judas and Simon so James is the
Lord's brother it says and are not his
sisters here with us apparently they
were married at that time and they were
offended at him but Jesus said to them a
prophet is not without honor except in
his own country and among his
own
relatives and in his own
house his people didn't believe in him
how do I know that well it suggested in
that text but John 7 and verse 5 says it
straight out his brothers did not
believe they didn't believe would you
suddenly your brother saysi the Messiah
the Son of God you're going to go yeah
right I'm the king of whatever you know
you're not going to believe that it's
mentioned in 1 Corinthians 15:7 among
what Paul just wrote is that James saw
him Jesus made a special visit to just
James it
says he believed in Acts 1 and vers 14
Luke records that he's with that group
or with his other brothers that aren't
named in that text but they're there
with Mary and he's a Believer now he
went from mocking him to being believer
in James 1 verse one he claims himself
to be a servant of the Lord Jesus Christ
so here you have it first you have a
persecutor becomes a Believer now you
have a brother of a man that you never
believed he was who he was and then
suddenly he's a
Believer what happened what did they see
what happened their testimony is rocking
strong I'm telling you the number
next this one may be the strongest of
all the testimony of John and I'm
talking about the Elder John I'm not
talking about young John that saw him
initially even though I am going to
mention the scripture about that this
this somewhere between 66 and 90
ad he lived to be
there he wrote we're going to talk about
what he wrote in just a second but John
20 and verse 8 was read a while ago it
says then the other disciple who's
always attributed to John because he
didn't name himself then the other
disciple who came to the tomb first
outran Peter probably wore out so
hanging on the outside breathing hard
and then the other disciple who came to
the tomb first went in also and he saw
and it says and
believed so you know what that suggests
he didn't really believe in the
resurrection before that but the point I
want you to see is now he is old when he
writes John chapter 20 that we read he
wrote that right he's now old he's got
to at least be in his 60s when he writes
John chapter 20 and John chapter 21 he's
60s something years old he is 30 years
down the line from seeing this he has
seen his fellow Apostles
killed he's the last one standing in 90
to 95 ad They're All Dead all he wants
to talk about in first John 2 John third
John is love and truth you get in the
The Book of Revelation he uses the word
Love and Truth over and over
again why do you talk about love and
truth over and over again if you know
you've been advocating a lie for over 50
years oh no if he's anywhere true to
what he
wrote he's the most reliable example of
believing this that could be so if you
really sit here just a moment I know
people have skepticism and they wish
that there was a resurrection cuz their
honey died their their loved one died
their grandpa
died and they'd love to believe but they
only have a wish you know most people
don't believe in the resurrection
because of science no more than you
believe in God because of science most
people believe in it because it hits
them right here in the
heart if you just get a moment here and
realize what's happened here you have
got three
undeniably strong proofs that you
shouldn't just wish there's a
resurrection or want that there's a
resurrection you should absolutely
know this is true it's reliable
testimony that proves the resurrection
oh there's so much more than Paul or
James or John John the ponderer thinking
on on this for 50 years and still
advocating the
resurrection you know if it's so
undeniably true
Rex why doesn't everybody
believe ain't convinced
me
well there's a little
thing called free
will you get to
decide and everything you believed up
until now you decided on
many live a life like
this I watch the news program that I
like and I believe everything they tell
me and I never watch the other
one and that's how I approach what I
believe I listen to the people who
support what I believe instead of
actually listening to the Bible or
listening to the evidence of the
Resurrection ction all I do is listen to
the science that suggest it isn't
true that's what we tend to do a lot of
us live there all the time and so if
you're asking why people don't believe
it's because they chose not to look have
you chosen to
look have you really
looked but if we saw him alive today let
me ask you this question let's just say
you saw Jesus alive today I'm not
anticipating that but if you did
and you believed it
today what would you
do how would that affect you I want you
to imagine
America okay let's Imagine That America
is
invaded and it's taken over we're
defeated put up a fight but they caught
us off guard and we
lose they take away our communication
we're not able to talk to each other
all the internet's down all the
telephone lines are down we can't do a
cell phone we are defeated we're
relegated to Pockets around the country
imagine this just for a second if you
will but our military is able to
strategize and figure out a way to come
back at them and they come back hard and
they win and they defeat our enemy
right but nobody knows knows it the
communication lines are down so you were
brought into a group of people by the
military and they tell you we've
won okay absolutely true but the people
don't know the internet's gone
telephones it's all gone will you be one
of our people who goes out and tells
we've
won would you go out like this uh well
you know you know uh uh uh uh well we I
think I think we're I think we've won or
would you go we've won we're no longer
slaves we're not given to that anymore
they're gone we have freed ourselves
from that would you not shut it from the
rooftop would you not want everybody to
know we're free we're out from
underneath that terrible
oppression Matthew chapter 10:27 what
you hear in the ear preach on the
housetops we need to make this the core
of what we talk about to everybody out
there that Jesus died for their sins he
was buried he rose again we need to make
that a part of every conversation we can
it was on February the 27th 1991
February the 22nd
1991 this actually happened Ruth dillow
received a very sad message from the
Pentagon her son Clayton Carpenter a
private first class had stepped on the
landmine in Desert Storm in cour wait
and was
killed she said this she later wrote I
can't begin to describe my grief and
shock it was almost more than I could
bear for three days I wept for three
days I expressed anger and loss for
three days people tried to comfort me to
no avail because the loss was too great
three
days after she was told that her son was
dead killed by a landmine she got a
phone
call
Mom it's
me I'm
alive he was injured but he wasn't
injured that bad rotillo said I couldn't
believe it at first but then I
recognized his voice and he really was
alive I laughed I cried I felt like
turning cartwheels because my son whom I
had thought was dead was really alive
I'm sure none of you can even begin to
understand how I
felt well there's a glimpse of it is
there if you got a call from Jesus today
on your cell phone this still works if
you got a call today imagine that what
if Jesus called you on the
phone would you believe
then gave you some information that only
he could know about you what you believe
then would you say I got to tell
everybody Jesus is
Alive he rose again and the best way you
can tell
everybody is let it change
you people believe that a lot better
than they believe a sermon you listening
to a sermon right now this is not nearly
as impressive as your
life not even
close but if you really
believe it'll change everything if Jesus
rose from the dead it
changes
everything to believe
is everything then you it's easy to
repent it's easy to confess Christ in
fact you almost want to shout it it's
easy to be baptized if you really
believe it's up to you Paul James John
they didn't believe it they knew it was
true and they gave everything they had
to
it do you
believe if you're ready to believe and
give your life to him why don't you come
while we stand while we see
