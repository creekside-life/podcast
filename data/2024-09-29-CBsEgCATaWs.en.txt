saw the Lord so Jesus said to them again
peace to you as the father has sent me I
also send you and when he had said this
he breathed on them and said to them
receive the Holy
Spirit if you forgive the sins of any
they are forgiven them if you retain the
sins of any they are
retained now Thomas called the twin one
of the 12 was not with them when Jesus
came this a little
boy who was sick one Sunday and it was
Palm Sunday and their Church did some
special events with Palm Sunday and gave
out palm branches anyway he had to stay
home that time from church and being a
little boy his mother had to stay with
him somebody had to watch
him and
after church was over his father who had
gone to church came home and he was
holding one of the palm branches that
they' given out at church to remind
everybody of Palm Sunday when Jesus made
his triumphant
entry the little boy was curious and
asked well why do you have that Palm
Branch
dad and his dad began trying to explain
it he says you see when Jesus came into
town everyone waved palm branches to
honor him so we got palm branches today
and the little sick boy said the only
Sunday I missed and Jesus shows
up well Jesus showed up and Thomas
wasn't
there the soul is challenged by
attendance every one of
us I know you think the people who come
all the time and you maybe don't think
well it's no challenge to you
it's always a
challenge the Soul's custom should be
like Jesus though I mean our goal is not
to build some kind of institution here
ultimately our goal is to be like Jesus
amen just to be like Jesus and so Jesus
had a couple of Customs take a look at
them Jesus custom was to regularly
worship
in attendance with attendance it says
again as we read a moment ago so he came
to Nazareth where he had been brought up
and as his custom was he went into the
synagogue now the synagogue came to mean
the building just like church has come
to mean the building but originally
synagogue just means assembly and church
means the household of God that's what
the word literally means uh the
household of the Lord but that's where
Jesus found himself on the Sabbath
day and Jesus custom wasn't just to
attend if you read it carefully his
custom was to read in church the Bible
he wanted to be one of the ones who
would read the Bible in church
gentlemen he wanted to be one of the
ones who would read the Bible in church
he says so he came to Nazareth where he
had been brought up and as his custom
was he went into the synagogue on the
Sabbath day and stood up to
read wouldn't it be great whoever
organizes their service this morning I'm
not know which one did it so much this
morning wouldn't it be great if men
stood in the line to serve in our
services just can't wait to be a part of
leading the
servants Jesus did that
he didn't wait to be assigned he
volunteered did you pick up on
that but it was more than that so Not
only was he consistent it was his custom
to be consistent in attendance it was
his custom to be consistent in helping
standing up to read but his custom was
also a third thing jesus' custom was
regular worship teaching in Matthew
13:54 it says and when he had come to
his own country
that's
capernum he taught them in their
synagogue so they were astonished and
said where did this man get this wisdom
and these Mighty works so it was not
just his custom to attend it was his
custom to volunteer to read and it was
his custom to teach when he was there
every chance he got I wish every man
would take that as an example you say
well what about the women I wish the
women would take that we have Bible
classes that need you
ladies wouldn't it be great if there
were lines
formed wouldn't that be great brother
Henson if you had to knock people
backward nearly to keep them from
volunteering to be a Bible class teacher
wouldn't that be
great just want to be like Jesus amen
amen just want to be like Jesus I'm not
very often like Jesus I want to be like
Jesus
the challenge of some is
attending because their custom is not to
attend regularly they have an an
attendance custom but it's very sporadic
it's just all over the show it's kind of
like when the notion hits you y'all
remember 911 was talked about a moment
ago you remember
911 do you remember September and into
October what church was like
you couldn't find a place to sit
down you remember that we had people in
the
forer yeah because they had no place to
sit you see some once each Sunday is
actually too much of
God that's too much Hebrews 10:25 says
not forsaking the assembling of
ourselves together as is the manner of
some new American Standard puts it as is
the habit of some it means the same as
this word that we're using in our text
in Luke 4 the custom but exhorting one
another and so much more as the day the
the problem was is that their custom
their habit their manner was not to
come you got that right that was their
habit for some once each Sunday is not
enough of God
to just come Sunday morning to worship
not go to bible class not go Sunday
night not go Wednesday to some that's
not enough of God they want more God you
see it's not about being churchy and
doing churchy things because we're a
member of the church but it's about
being with
God Psalm 55 verses 16 and 17 says as
for me I will call upon God and and the
Lord shall save me evening and morning
and at noon I will pray and cry aloud
and he shall hear my
voice now for
some they can just never get enough of
God you think well there it is morning
noon in evening unto thee I will pray we
even sing that song remember we sing it
here in church it's one of the songs we
sing but listen to this passage Psalm
1191
164 seven times a day I praise you
because of your righteous
judgments funny how we can go from seven
times a day to maybe once a
month
maybe you remember I mentioned this in
the last few lessons Dr Robert
Godfrey when he was asked should we have
two services on the Lord's day and he
said my inclination to that is to say
why can't we have
three the day Belongs to the Lord at
least that's what Revelation 1 and verse
10 says I was in the spirit on the
Lord's
Day Charles Haden Spurgeon a wellknown
um Baptist preacher English particular
Baptist particularly I know that sounds
funny he's particularly a English
particular
Baptist um known for preaching at what
was called the Metropolitan Tabernacle
in London he died in
1892 this is what he said about
attendance never neglect the means of
Grace God May bless us when we are not
in his
house but we have the greater reason to
hope that he will when we are in
communion with his
Saints so God May bless you in ways that
we couldn't imagine if you're not here
it's true because God is
good but the odds are in your favor I
like the odds almost half of what we do
by the way is automatic at least that's
what science says science says that
we're on auto autopilot about 45% of the
time I bet you noticed that right you
headed home and you get home and you
realize oh I forgot to right we're on
autopilot we don't even know where we
were I I remember the other day I was
driving and I thinking I don't even
remember passing that area a little less
driving through that area and now I'm
where I'm going you know what I'm saying
we're on auto autopilot when we when we
eat we're on autopilot when we breathe
when we sleep when we go to to bed at
night we're on autopilot 48 50% of the
time we're like on autopilot so habits
are not
uncommon it would be uncommon to not
have habits if you didn't have Customs
you would be the odd bird out quite
honestly that's just the way it would be
habits both the reason that we have
habits is because they are helpful we
develop them
so that we can get what we need done
done as easily as we can now we can
change our habits and we do from time to
time and so you can change a bad habit
like not attending that can become a
changed habit where you develop a custom
a habit of attending church every Sunday
you can develop the habit of attending
church services and going to Sunday
school every Sunday that's not beyond
your capabilities you may think that's
beyond your capabilities but you could
be here every single
Sunday you could be here every single
Sunday
school and if you were brave enough you
could be here every Sunday night but
more than that you could be here every
Wednesday night oh I could never develop
that you developed the habit of driving
into your house you can develop any
habit you wish to develop it's not out
of your
reach did you know that the average
church is developed into five groups
this is average this was told to me my
um who told me this is either a Baptist
or Methodist preacher we were talking
one day and he says this is the way
Church attendance runs and I've watched
it and I found it to be true listen to
me I'm going to walk you through it
20% of the average church will be here
every Sunday this
month 20% will be here three of the four
times this month 20% will be here two of
the four times this month and 20% will
be here one of the four times this month
wait there's 100% we got one more when
are they coming we never know
they just show
up and we never know when they're coming
they clearly don't have any
habits strong
Christians have a habit of attending as
many of the services as they can and
that's why strong Christians Sunday
night is a habit it helps them live the
Christian Life and I'll give you three
reasons that that's true and then it
will be done
number one habitually attending every
service helps strong Christians feed
their Spirit by the way your spirit
needs to be fed you may think you don't
need a good meal for your spirit then
you're probably not the person you ought
to be right now you could be better if
you fed your spirit a little more in
Matthew 4:4 it says but he answered and
said it is written man shall not live by
bread alone but by every word that
proceeds from the mouth of God now I
know you think that this is pruning my
feathers because I'm a
mouthpiece if it's not me it'll be
somebody else and it will be somebody
else
eventually somebody will be speaking we
had several men speaking already
somebody's going to be speak somebody's
going to be leading that's not what it's
about it's about if you're going to live
we don't live by bread alone if you
really want to be fed we're fed by every
word that proceeds from the mouth of God
and Deuteronomy chapter 8:3 it says that
he suffered them to not have regular
food and he humbled them and he humbled
them so that they would know and fed
them with Mana in the wilderness that
they would know that man does not live
by bread alone but by every word that
proceeds from the mouth of God
this
thing feeds a strong Christian it feeds
us it'll feed your
spirit number
two habitually attending every service
helps strong Christians build their
faith you want to not panic the next
time something scary
happens if things go upside down on this
election that's coming which they may
very well be because half the country
wants to go one way and half wants to go
the other might there not be some angry
people whichever way it ends up
going how do you face that without
worry just like if a meteor was headed
toward us right
now how you do
it you build your faith how do you build
build your faith what would we be doing
if we knew a meteor was 25 Million Miles
Away about to hit the planet and was
going to land right here in Brandon some
of you be moving to Japan I know but the
bottom line is Jude 1 verse 20 but you
beloved building yourselves up in your
Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy
Spirit that's what You' be doing You' be
praying you be building yourself up
strengthening yourself in 1 Samuel 30: 6
it says d David strengthened himself in
the Lord how do you strengthen yourself
in the Lord you get into this and you
get on your knees that's how you do
it habitually attending every service
helps strong Christians control their
thoughts now if you're not into
controlling your thoughts that's a
different thing but if you actually
believe that if you let your thoughts
run wild you'll end up doing things you
ought not be doing
which most of us actually know is
true 2 Corinthians 10: 4-6 says for the
weapons of our Warfare are not carnal
But Mighty and God for pulling down
strongholds casting down arguments and
every High thing a lot of people think
this is external you're dealing with
them out there but one of the persons I
have to argue with more than anybody
else is this
one this one I have to argue with if you
aren't arguing with this one you you got
problems but listen to what he says
casting down arguments and every High
thing that exalts itself against the
knowledge of God bringing every thought
into captivity to The Obedience of
Christ because as you recall without
Christ influence on our life the man's
thoughts were evil
continually but with Christ it says in
being ready to punish all
Disobedience when your obedience is
fulfilled Joshua
1:8 it says the book of the law shall
not depart from your
mouth didn't say from your
mind it says from your mouth now you
don't say things that don't pass through
here first I you may think you do I said
that without thinking no you thought
about those words once on a time they
can't come out you can't speak a word
you've never
heard right so it passes through here
before it comes out here now listen to
what it says Joshua 1 18 that the book
of the law shall not depart from your
mouth and that's where you'll have good
success that means that I must control
my thoughts by
controlling my thoughts I control my
words I need to pour it in
before it comes out pour it in and it
comes out so habitually attending every
service helps strong Christians control
their thoughts perfectly I've never seen
anybody perfect in my
life and then habitually attending every
service help strong Christians close to
what we just talk about
speak the
word if you want to be a person that
could actually have have a conversation
with somebody about Jesus you might want
to put some Jesus
in you want to have a talk about
spiritual matters you want to discuss
deeper
ideas pour it in where do you pour it in
well this is not the only place but it's
a good place to pour it in and 1 Peter
chapter 4: 11 it says if anyone speaks
let him speak as the Oracles of God if
anyone ministers let him do it as with
the ability God supplies that in all
things God may be glorified through
Jesus Christ to whom belong the glory
and the Dominion forever and ever amen
so if we speak we should speak as the
Oracles of God how do we get
there come here and we pour it
in that's one way it's not the only way
you can be reading your Bible every day
obviously but this is a very very
profitable place to be when you can be
here vitually attending every service
helps strong Christians praise the
Lord you know I I I've heard people say
you know all is all we're going to do
when we get to heaven just sit around
and praise the
Lord you know I don't know that that
worked for me for about a thousand years
I believe I don't know I suspect it's
not the only thing but it it would be
really nice who who doesn't love a good
singing praising God Amen I mean I mean
I absolutely one of the most blessed
times is to just literally praise the
Lord Ephesians 5: 18 through 20 says
this and do not be drunk with wine in
which is dissipation or excess but be
filled with the spirit speaking to one
another in Psalms and hymns and
spiritual songs singing and making
melody in your heart to the Lord you
know there are people who sit in our
building that don't sing I that m if I
me but let me encourage you to develop
the habit of saying even if you're not
that good at it in your mind it doesn't
matter you need to do
it singing and making melody in your
heart to the Lord the melody is in here
not out here all the time this is not as
important as this it's important but not
as important verse 20 giving thanks
always for all things to God the father
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in
Psalm 34 verse1 it says is I'll bless
the
Lord at all
times and I will praise
Him
continually I love that bless the Lord
at all times and I will praise Him
continually with my mouth amen we we we
need to
want to praise the
lord we don't come here ever and not
sing have y'all noticed that
we never meet without singing we always
sing We may not always have sermons
praise the Lord but we always
sing and that's
good number
next habitually attending every service
helps strong Christians pray without
ceasing I don't know if you know it but
we're under a commandment it's not
something I spoke I don't have the right
to tell you what to do never have never
will I barely have the right to
encourage my own family what to do but I
certainly don't have the right to tell
you what to do but by the inspiration of
the Holy Spirit Paul does as an apostle
of Jesus Christ in 1 Thessalonians 5:1
17 he said pray without
ceasing now if you're staying at home
home just to pray God bless
you I don't think that's the best use of
your time but okay at least you're
praying we should be praying Amen in 2
Corinthians 7:14 the great passage on
that subject If my people who are called
by my name shall humble
themselves and
pray and seek my
face and turn from their Wicked Ways
which by the way way you have Wicked
Ways even if you don't want to admit it
every one of us does we have Wicked Ways
and turn from their wicked ways I will
hear them amen then you want to pray and
be heard there it is prayer praying
without ceasing it's hard to claim that
you want to pray without ceasing when
you cease to want to be with those who
are prayed
habitually attending every service helps
strong Christians lay aside
encumbrances encumbrances to what to
doing
good Hebrews 12 verse1 King James says
therefore a new King James therefore we
also since we are surrounded by so great
a cloud of witnesses it's the witness of
chapter 11 and the angels in heaven let
us lay aside every
weight and the sin which so easily and
snares us and let us run with endurance
the race that is set before us New
American Standard says it this way let
us lay aside every incumbent every
incumbrance anything that would hinder
me from doing what's right now th this
may not sound like a a goal for
you but to me that's like the biggest
thing I've said so
far anything that would hinder me trying
to live the Christian
Life anything laying it aside I love the
Ezekiel 26:16 passage where it says let
those who are
wealthy lay aside their
robes fall on their
knees and sit and
tremble you ever
tremble now I think laying aside
anything that would keep me from
the things we just talked about look
look at what we just talked about
habitually attending every service helps
strong Christians you say well what
about the weak Christians obviously it
would help the weak Christians but we're
talking about the ones who are doing it
it's already their
habit habitually attending every service
helps strong Christians feed their
Spirit build their
faith control their
thoughts speak the word praise the Lord
pray without ceasing and lay aside every
encumbrance to do what's
right now some listening to this
lesson don't even attend every Sunday
morning I'm not trying to be ugly I'm
trying to help you see where you're at
did you know that 48 % of people who
call themselves church members
churchgoers attend 48% that's right at
half right maybe I'm wrong about 48 it's
close to 50 right 48% of those who claim
church membership attend once a
month if I've caught that person this is
your one
Sunday one some you remember the five I
saw one of them only attends once a
month wait that
one is more than I
said it's a lot somebody says to me then
well after this sermon why are you
preaching attending all services when
some don't attend it all well the people
who don't attend at all ain't hearing
this is
it and then the one who attends once a
month he probably ain't either
and by the way if you're looking for the
reason that this lesson is is that uh
this lesson actually gave you some
reasons to be here to be a stronger
person there was a
uh a man who was 100 years
old 100 years old sound like a worthy
goal doesn't it I don't know as much as
I hurting out 67 but any rate let's just
say a 100 years there it is he's been
going to church since he was a young man
and so his family wanted to honor him
this church wanted to honor him it was
his birthday Church got together there's
about a hundred people there he's a
hundred years old and they have cake
they have ice cream let's go sit with
them amen it was a great day and after
they had the cake and the ice cream and
celebrating his hundred years there and
been a member of that church ever since
he was a young man they went into the
auditorium and in the auditorium his one
of his grandsons who was about 30
something got up in the pull pit and
started talking a little bit about him
and then invited his uh great uh Grandpa
to come up in the pull pit and stand
with him just a moment and so he stood
there with him and he said this to his
grandpa he says uh great grandpa we all
know that you can barely
hear great Grandpa we all know that you
can barely hear and you cannot
see so tell all of us why do you still
go to church every Sunday at 100 years
old The 100y Old Faithful Christian said
this well
because I love Jesus with all all my
heart and he commanded me to be
here and I just want to show everybody
whose side I'm
on can others tell which side you're
on do people look at you and say they're
on the Lord's
Side remember Moses
asking who's on the Lord's
Side let let him come to
me you on the Lord's Side does everybody
in your family know
it do your children know you're on the
Lord's
Side does your wife know you're on the
Lord's Side does your husband know
you're on the Lord's
Side do your parents know you're on the
Lord's
Side who's on the Lord's
Side don't you want everybody to know
whose side you're
on if you're not sure we have an
invitation to try to help you make sure
you're on the Lord side
