you know why things
happen matter to us
all I don't know if you remember Super
Bowl
41 then the Indianapolis Colts W 29 to
17 over the Chicago
Bears the
MVP uh let me explain something not
every woman in here and not probably not
even every man but 90% of the men love
football and uh a good percentage of you
women but there will be some so maybe I
should explain MVP most valuable player
of the game the MVP for that game was
the quarterback from uh the Indianapolis
Colts pton Manning he was 25 of 38
attempts for 247 yards and one
touchdown uh one interception though and
the reason I bring this up is because
the interception
see he started the game as quarterback
and he almost immediately threw an
interception so he goes to the
sidelines spends a few minutes with the
coaches and they're all
talking and they're trying to explain to
him why that happened then he put his
helmet on and he got ready for the next
drive you see sometimes knowing why why
a thing
happened is important and it matters and
it can
help but it doesn't always
help why did Maui
burn knowing the
why may not
help officials don't really know the
exact causes you've heard all this
experts say it was the temperatures it
was the strong winds from Dora the Cat 4
hurricane it was the drought conditions
they had been through additionally CNN
reported uh that a state agency delayed
a water management company's request to
make more water available to fight
wildfires and that was not
available so accounts from those caught
in the fire say that the actual death
toll was probably more likely $480
plus
terrible terrible things happen all the
time y'all seen the rocket attacks in
Israel
why why do you look at life the way you
do look at it there's a
question why do you look at life the way
you look at it when things seem to go
wrong for
you do you always ask why is this
happening to me which of course if you
realize it it leads to kind of a
victimhood a feeling as though there's
something wrong with us or there's
something wrong with
that or do you ask why is this happening
for me that takes us in a different
direction maybe a deeper
growth a deeper awareness maybe even a
deeper
responsibility Chris kristopherson y'all
know that guy remember him he had a song
that was pretty popular a few years ago
most of you probably won't remember it
why me
Lord what have I ever done well that
sounds negative doesn't it but listen
where it goes why me Lord what have I
ever done to deserve even one of the
pleasures I've known tell me Lord what
did I ever do that was worth loving you
or the kindness you shown it kind of
flips it upside down now does
it there is uh a question in our text
that deserves an answer and I think
we're going to try to answer that in a
way that would be helpful to you but it
won't appear that at first because
actually we're going to delve into the
mystery of the question
itself but my God my God why deserves an
answer and the reasons are given in
scripture there are quite a few Hebrews
as far as Jesus is concerned Hebrews 2
Verse 18 suffered being tempted and he's
able but as a result of that to Aid
those who are tempted so if Jesus hadn't
suffered he wouldn't be as good of
advocate for you Hebrews 5 and ver8 he
learned obedience by the things which he
suffered something that God had never
had to do before he now learned to do
and therefore he understands how
difficult it is to obey in a way that he
only knew intellectually before in 1
Peter 2: 21 Christ also suffered for us
leaving us an example so part of the
reason that this happened is we needed
to know what kind of attitude and what
kind of behavior should we follow as we
Face our suffering 1 Peter 3:18 Christ
also suffered once for sin the just for
the unjust now we begin to realize what
the significance of his suffering was
and that is that he suffered in our
place 1 Peter 4:1 Christ suffered for us
in the flesh so if like
Christ in the
revealing and this is going to happen to
you okay so you're going to suffer
because you're
human if like Christ in the
revealing you learn earned many good but
previously unknown reasons for your
suffering would that make it all
better we'll come back to that
question Christ himself on the cross
gives us four answers to my God my God
why we're going to look at some
Mysteries here
today and I think this will challenge
some of your thoughts it's challenged
mine
and I'm still sitting here going on some
of what I'm going to share with you
going
really number
one the reason why Jesus suffered was
for not to but for the
proclamation it says Matthew 7
27:46 and about the ninth hour Jesus
cried out with a loud voice now that's
significant to me I think you need to
recognize that he cried out with a loud
voice that's recorded also in the
passage that's parallel Mark 15:34 he
cried out with a loud voice what's the
significant of that well Psalm
22:1 is used Often by the Jews and it is
a lament song it is usually sung during
times of great distress as in the
Holocaust or as in right now Under Siege
that they are so the song is a wailing
song it is usually sung in a wailing
voice and it isn't usually a Cried Out
song so Jesus cried out with a loud
voice as if done to announce something
which is different so it is something he
is announcing and you got to remember
that Jesus is the greatest preacher
there ever will be and he came as a
proclaimer of Truth in Luke 4: 19 is a
quote of Isaiah
61:1 when it says he came to proclaim
the acceptable year of the world the
acceptable year of the Lord and it's the
word Caruso in the Greek it means to
basically be like a town crier to cry
out in Mark 1 verse 45 it says he began
to Proclaim it freely talking about what
he was preaching as Caruso to Herald it
so everyone would
hear it wasn't a shy thing it wasn't a
whale it was a cry John 12: 32 it says
and I if I am lifted up from the earth
will draw All Peoples to
myself so it was Christ's goal to
Proclaim the gospel even as he is
fulfilling the gospel hear
me God wants to reach us all now however
you see it he wants to reach the world
you may not know this but right now we
stand in a different world than we've
ever lived in and I'm not talking about
all the new fangle
stuff the most up until when I was a
child the most of the people who
believed in Jesus
worldwide was just barely 1/4 of the
population of the world it is now 2.6
billion of the
7.88 billion that means it's more than
33% of the world's population now
believes that Jesus is the Christ the
son of the Living God that's a
significant change from 1/4 to 1/3 and
it's not just 1/3 it's more than 1/3
it's actually 37% of the world's
population so there is a reason to
Proclaim and he was doing
it another thing that you need to
see the reason why Jesus suffered was
for the prophetic this is critical it's
a critical understanding let me read it
to you again you'll pick up the words
and about the ninth hour Jesus cried out
with a loud voice saying IL Lama I'm
going to stop right there we'll come to
the next word in a
minute what you have here is believed to
be by almost every scholar that I've
ever read from this is the word you want
to remember the word it's called an
inipit not everybody knows the word it's
inipit I NCI i p uh I NCI i p i t and
sipit what it means generally speaking
we did not you know you hold up your
Bible and what you'll see is titles of
books chapters and
verses that's not the way the Bible
originally was there were no chapters
there were no verses so if you wanted to
call attention to a particular passage
this was common in the ancient world is
that you would use the opening text of a
manuscript or early printed book or a
chant uh you would the first verse of a
lurgical chant so that it would call
your attention to the passage I want you
to look at so by Jesus quoting Psalm 22
verse1 what he's actually doing that you
might not have paid attention to is
using an incipit he's drawing your
attention to the passage because he
couldn't say go to Psalm 22:1 and start
reading right there was no such thing as
that sort of thing to do and and so if
Jesus used it as an incipit what he's
really doing is calling your attention
to the fact that he is the Messiah Psalm
22:1 if you just want to look at it
quickly you look one look at verses 7
and 8 look at verse 16 look at Verse 18
you cannot deny that this is absolutely
fulfilled in the cross verse 7 says they
shoot out the lip they shake the head
saying and verse eight says he trusted
in the Lord let him rescue him if you'll
have him verse 16 says they pierced my
hands and my feet Verse 18 said they
divided my garments among them and for
my clothing that cast lights all of that
fulfilled and Christ on the cross Luke
24: 44 then he said to them these are
the words which I spoke to you while I
was still with you that all things must
be fulfilled this is prophetic All
Things Must Be fulfilled which are
written in the law of Moses and the
prophets and the
Psalms concerning me so literally my God
my God is a prophetic
utterance but it's
more and this is the most challenging
one it's very interesting what's being
said here it says about the ninth hour
Jesus cried out with a loud voice saying
El
sabak well that and you notice the word
that is after
that this is
difficult and I could be wrong I did not
learn this by studying it myself I
learned this from
someone what you may not realize is what
it literally says is you have done saach
to me if you just take the word saach
out of it and that's what the Senate
structure says you have done saach to me
the Hebrew in Psalm 22 verse one is not
sabat that's interesting isn't it did
you know that the Hebrew is
aabani
aabani so which is what's going on here
saach is it it
transliterated uh because that is
doesn't mean necessarily exactly what he
just
said but that is to say kind of so is
that what's going on here should we not
take it literal but
saach here's the strange thing literally
like that the way it's said there does
not exist in Hebrew or
Aramaic that's a bit of a shock is it so
was it a mistake by
Jesus he said the wrong
word didn't know
Hebrew or was it a mistake by Matthew or
mark because there is a word similar in
the Hebrews shabbach or
shabach which is close to the
same uh word in caldan or Neo Aramaic
but there's a problem with that because
if that's the word he was using it
creates a
problem because if you plug shabach or
sheach into it it
means uh Eli Eli you kept me
unharmed now that didn't quite fit Psalm
221 and it doesn't quite fit what's
going on right at this moment because
he's hanging on a cross
suffering
so did they hear Jesus
wrong well that's not like because it's
inspired right couldn't be heard wrong
so what if you used a different word
that sounded
like saak
Tani that's possible I mean through the
interpretation Through The Years you
know what if Jesus used the word zabak
now I know you said that's the almost
same thing really it sounds like nearly
the same thing to me he could to use
zabach or
zebach now what makes interesting about
that if that's the the word he used then
it's
zabatani or zeani which sounds nearly
like sabani doesn't it to me I mean I'm
just just
me what makes that so interesting is
zebach or zabach means
sacrifice so
zeani means you have sacrificed me
remember the shabbach you
have done shabbach to
me so zeak means you've sacrificed me
but zabach would mean
Slaughter so zabatani would be you have
slaughtered me for sacrifice
whoa is Jesus slipping something in here
that we missed that we had made
attention to was he actually saying if
all that is correct and by the way I am
no Hebrew scholar
Jesus did something maybe a little
greater than we were expecting he not
only pronounced an incipit and Drew your
attention to Psalm 21 verse one so that
all the world and we've been all going
saying oh even Jesus said why why why
and what we were missing is that he's
trying to draw your attention to Psalm
22 but now he's trying to draw your
attention maybe to the fact that I'm
here to Pardon your sins I am the
slaughtered
sacrifice
wow so you see that it's a messiah
telling you what the Messiah would do
well it is true that he was the
slaughtered sacrifice whether that's the
correct rendering of that word or not
Hebrews 9:26 he then would have had to
suffer often since the foundation of the
world but now once at the end of the age
he has appeared to put away sin by the
sacrifice of himself
it's an interesting
mystery but
more the reason why Jesus suffered
for he suffered for the punishment do
you and
me and about the ninth hour Jesus cried
out with a loud voice saying Eli L sabak
that is my God my God why have you
forsaken
me so that is is still there the holy
spirit is
bewell with Jesus Jesus unjust
situation Jesus is unfairly
Forsaken and yet we know that God does
not literally forsake Jesus here because
of all the scripture we have that says
he will never forsake his own in fact we
know that the person who wrote this
David was never totally fors forsaken by
God that didn't really happen to David
who wrote this this is a hyperbole that
he has written but it shows how David
felt when men turn their backs on him
right it does and it feels like God has
left you when men turn their backs on
you and so we know that now we that
Jesus in the midst of this pain also
feels the weight and the burden of the p
punishment of feeling forsaken by a man
and now if he will by God so Mark and
Matthew affirm that this is the way
Jesus felt even if sabatan means what it
means it still means that Jesus felt
forsaken at this moment unjustly being
killed oh and that's true that is true
the law of God would have forbid this
happening he should not have been so in
many way way the law had forsaken him
but God had never forsaken him but it
felt like God was forsaken you ever felt
that way ever felt that
way now here's where we're going now let
me say that he was wounded for our
transgressions he was bruised for our
iniquities the chastisement of our peace
was upon him and by his stripes we are
healed the Paradox of the ages he
suffered in our place he was punished
and you get off you don't get punished
he got punished you can live scot-free
and he got
punished you get to go to heaven walk on
streets of gold and Shout forever more
because he got
punished the question that deserves an
answer
is my God my God why and here's what we
see in Jesus it was for the procl
he cried
out it was farther the prophetic it's an
incipit pay attention to Psalm 22 verse
one it was for the pardon that is I was
slaughtered and sacrificed for you and
it was for the punishment that means I
know what it feels like to be forsaken
of God so you don't have to feel that
way the cross didn't happen to
him but it happened for great
reasons now like job and Jesus here's
where we go with all of this lesson
let's bring this around what that means
to you and me because you and I are
always asking why why me Lord not the
way that Chris Christopherson asked it
but why me why am I going through all
the hard things I'm going
through well job and Jesus had a reason
to ask that there are many possible
answers in our wives here's one that we
suffer because there's a hidden
agenda Satan's working behind the scenes
we know that was true with job and we
know it was true with Jesus you shall
bruise his
heel and he drove nails through jesus'
Hills in the cross and watched him die
in
shame that the theology that says all
suffering is not directly directed
to a worst of all Sinners is what comes
through in the Book of Job job wasn't
the worst of all Sinners Jesus wasn't
the worst of all Sinners and if you have
trouble in your life it's not because
you're the worst of all
Sinners that all suffering and we all do
suffer and we should not as a result of
that judge each other based upon our
suffering but if you want to judge
somebody judge yourself like Paul did
say I'm the
worst I deserve far
worse so it's hard to complain when
things do get a little
worse that anyone who will not help a
sinner when they are suffering because I
don't want to participate and what
obviously God's doing to them and
therefore I don't want to be on the
other side of God while God's dist
destroying them and me lifting them up
oh no no no the lesson is clear in both
job his friends were wrong
but there were other friends that came
in and helped and so too there was a
Judas but there were 11 others that were
faithful and that later we might recover
and even be more blessed yeah that's a
possibility no matter what terrible
things happening The Book of Job is full
of that message is it not that things
could get better they could be twice as
good as they were before and by the way
that message comes through in Jesus who
sits on the throne of glory and every
knee will bow and every tongue will
confess to his glory that God doesn't
owe me an explanation of why I can shout
why as loud as I want but he doesn't
know me one he didn't know job one and
he didn't answer when Jesus cried out
either that if we suffer when we do
right there are great reasons we've
looked at some
right and we will be rewarded for our
patience later on so you get maybe
double for your trouble or you'll get to
go there right which one is it you know
which one is it I'm good with either if
like Christ here's the big question
question I'm coming back you remember me
asking this question at the beginning if
like Christ you learned through
suffering and in the
revealing you learned many good but
previously unknown reasons for your
suffering would that make it all better
right
now
nah probably
not that's just the way we
are so it may
take something like that though to do
something else you know it may actually
take the
darkness for us to
refocus there's a story told by James H
Brooks he's American preacher and he's
an author he wrote a book about this he
visits a friend's
house while he's visiting his friend's
house he hears singing sounds like a
bird but it can't be a bird because it's
actually singing a
tune and yet he keeps looking around and
sure enough there's a bird in a
cage not chanting you know you know
nothing like that it's a tune the bird
is singing a
tune he said what in the world I've
never never heard of that sort of thing
it's beautiful it's like a great
classical tune the bird singing what's
going
on the lady of the house said yeah
that's a bird and we taught it that
thing well how did you do it said well
you can't teach a
bird toe like that in the
daytime you have to make it dark where
there's nothing to distract them and all
they hear
is the
tune you see if it doesn't get dark you
won't hear the
song you'll never know the song and you
won't get your
focus because there's so many things
distracting you if you don't have the
darkness many people will never focus on
God all of us have to have our attention
grabbed back we don't like it we don't
like the way it happens but God in the
midst of your sorrow if you pay really
close
attention will give you a tune he'll put
a song on your heart that can never be
taken
away if you want to find out more about
God then you got to do it as a Christian
if you want to become a Christian we'll
help you you can repent of your sins
today confess Christ Jesus be baptized
today we'll help you every way we can if
you need to come come while we stand and
while we
sing
