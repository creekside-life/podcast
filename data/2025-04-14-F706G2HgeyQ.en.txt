so let's address the elephant in the
room i am indeed Terry
Reeves and I am dressed in a suit and
tie
um I've had multiple people want to know
who I am and what did I do with Terry it
is me i uh credit my attire to all the
gentlemen that have preached in front of
me that wore jackets and ties that
forced me to fall to peer pressure so
here I
am i appreciate so much the opportunity
to get to
speak and I just want to tell you
upfront uh I've rewritten this lesson at
least seven different times um
so I'm not sure where it's going to go
but we're gonna just launch and see what
happens tonight so my name is Terry
Reeves so I'm going to just give you a
quick bio about me um I currently serve
as the deacon over the missions program
here at school and and at um Creekide
um when I moved here 14 years ago uh
Jonathan Smith offered me a job over at
FCA and one of the first things he said
was "I want you to implement a mission
program at our school i want our
students going down to Honduras." And
then attending what was then Bell
Scholes and now Creekide uh we
implemented the same thing through a man
named Steve Johnson uh who started
bringing people down
um I'm from Huntsville Alabama in case
you haven't picked up on the accent and
uh I grew up there and uh went to Freed
Hardman University where I got my degree
in education and we've lived my wife and
I we've lived in Miami in Orlando we've
lived in Sarasota Nashville Huntsville
Alabama and for the last 14 years we've
lived right here um at this congregation
this is the longest tenure I've ever
been anywhere so I'm in uncharted waters
at this point to be quite honest
my missions program uh plan of action so
to speak is I oversee the work uh that's
taking place in Honduras in Panama
Guatemala i recruit volunteers to go and
work at the various campaigns that we
plan i plan and budget funds that
support the projects that we'll be doing
i plan and lead the summer mission trips
and I provide reports to the elders and
to the congregation so that's my
official capacity and uh I love every
minute of it when they asked me to
become a
deacon they asked me the most glorious
question
uh for all of us they said "What
ministry would you like to be in charge
of?" And I was like "You're you're
you're giving us a choice." And I said
"Can I do missions?" And they're like
"We'd like for you to do missions." I'm
like "Oh my goodness how cool is this i
get to oversee myself uh how often do
you become your own boss it was great
and so I've been excited about that ever
since
um it's it's a wonderful wonderful thing
that I do all right so just to give you
a quick rundown uh we do have three
trips this summer uh this is my last
plug uh we have a June 7th trip a
oneweek trip to Honduras uh we have a
June 21st trip for one week to Panama
where we'll be working with Trent and
Debbie Wheeler and I'll tell you a
little bit more about that in a minute
but and then we have a July 1 through 11
trip which is also to
Honduras and uh currently we have open
spots in all the trips if there's still
and we're still having people sign up
and um it's not too late if you would
like to go on one of the trips
so the title of my lesson tonight is
keep the main
thing no there it is the main
thing keep the main thing the main
thing so my primary objective tonight is
to explain to you what the main thing is
and it's really broken into two parts
but they're connected together
the main thing number one for all of us
every single person in here is
evangelism the second thing that we are
all responsible for is maintaining a
strong and healthy congregation from the
top down that's our two objectives
that's the two things that every single
person that attends the Creekide Church
that is our two goals and they're tied
together evangelism maintaining a
healthy church and we're going to be
talking about that
tonight i'm going to go through several
scriptures that will show you the
importance of evangelism some of them
are quite obvious some of them you may
not have ever thought of as a evangelism
scripture especially the scripture that
was read tonight um and I'm going to
show you how that all ties in later but
um before we get into it I'm going to
kind of start off with a story to uh set
the stage when I lived in Orlando
uh for about three years I worked at a a
huge water park uh called Water Mania
and um I was one of the park
supervisors and my area of the park was
training and overseeing all of the
lifeguards all of the EMTs
uh all of the slide operators and all
the people that worked um at the water
park at the time we had the largest
water uh wave pool in North America it
wasn't until Disney came along and built
Typhoon Lagoon that we lost our title we
had this massive massive wave pool and
so I scheduled my
lifeguards at their different positions
every day so on our wave pool uh we had
eight eight lifeguards on duty and they
worked in 30 minute shifts and then they
would rotate to a new spot until they
worked their way around the pool so we
had uh in this lifeguard stands we had
uh four lifeguards we had two lifeguards
that were standing in the shallower end
when we had two lifeguards that were
actually in the water because our wave
machine generated some pretty
significant waves and when the wave
machine kicked on
um unless you were a really strong
swimmer you could be overtaken by the
waves very quickly so you can kind of
imagine the um the responsibility that
the lifeguards would have they had a
kill button at their stands and they
could kill the waves if
anybody was struggling
and they were all assigned a certain
little area that they they monitored and
they scanned that area and they watched
really intently and really intensely to
make sure the people in their area was
safe most of them were on tubes so they
could float and enjoy the big waves and
we had a few that wanted to get out
there and swim and their whole objective
was to make sure they were safe and yes
we did have to make rescues uh there
were times we had to shut the machines
down and the lifeguards had to go down
into the water and pull people out kind
of a scary thing i remember my first
rescue um I was on the rotation that day
and I was watching my little grid and I
saw this probably 9 10 year old boy and
he was on his tube and I glanced over i
and I I saw him and then I rotated away
from him and then when I came back the
tube was
empty the little boy was not on the tube
and I looked and about seven or eight
feet down in the water he was just just
floating and his eyes were really big
and we he literally was looking at me
hit the kill switch went down in the
water pulled him
out that was a really intense moment in
my
life i'll never forget it um the little
boy didn't know how to swim without that
inner tube uh he was destined to go down
and he did so let me can I give you a
scenario so I was moved to supervisor
and so my job is to make sure my
lifeguards are doing what they're
supposed to do i got 65 people to choose
from who do you think I chose as my
eight guards that were going to be
working on my on the wave
poolool you think I picked my my eight
best if you say that you're absolutely
right
i picked my very best guards to work
that wave poolool so
imagine having a lifeguard that's been
completely
trained and he's in the chair and he's
supposed to be watching his
grid and he sees somebody struggling in
the water and he just kind of like
shakes his head he's like "Not feeling
it today." And he doesn't react
can you even
imagine a scenario like that can you
even picture something like that i don't
want to get my hair wet you know i just
I just don't feel like going in
today what would happen to the a
lifeguard that had that kind of
attitude yeah he's off the he's going to
be off that pool really really fast
he's going to be
working the putt putt course or
something we can't afford to have
somebody like that in the in the guard
stand that's supposed to be watching and
taking care of the people in his area
because the the pool got deeper and
deeper as you got into the pool at the
very end of the pool it was almost 20 ft
deep and if you weren't just a seriously
strong swimmer you had no business being
out in that deep end but we had people
went out there all the
time i want to compare that
lifeguard to
us we are
lifeguards every one of us if you're a
baptized believer and you're a member of
the church and you're part of the
redeemed you are now a
lifeguard and your job is to guard your
grid your job is to make sure those
people are safe your job is to rescue
those that are in need the ones that are
struggling that is our job
but unfortunately we have a lot of
people
today that don't want to do
that they don't want to jump in the
water they don't want to get their hair
wet they don't feel like they're that
they have enough training they don't
think that they have the skill
level i'm telling you when somebody goes
down in the water you're not really
worried about how much skill level
you've got you're worried about saving
that
person right is everybody with me on
that um we've got to take our jobs
seriously and until we
do the church is not going to grow the
way it's supposed to
grow okay let's go through some
scriptures real
quick matthew 18:18-20
all of excuse me all authority has been
given unto me in heaven and
earth therefore go and make disciples of
all nations baptizing them in the name
of the Father the Son and the Holy
Spirit teaching them to obey everything
I commanded you and surely I will be
with you even to the very end of the age
key words
therefore
go mark 16 15 and
16 jesus said to them "Go into all the
world preach the gospel to every
creature he who believes and is baptized
will be saved he who does not believe
will be condemned
1 Peter
3:15 "But in your hearts rever Christ as
Lord always be
prepared to give an answer to everyone
who asks for the reason of the hope
that's within you but do it with
gentleness and
respect." Excuse
me 2 Corinthians 5:20
we are therefore Christ's
ambassadors as though God himself were
making his appeal through
us second Timothy 2 verse1
15 do your best to present yourself to
God as one approved a worker who does
not need to be ashamed of who correctly
handles the word of truth
ephesians chapter
2:10 for we are all God's handiwork
created in Christ Jesus to do good works
which God has prepared in advance for us
to do romans
1:16 I am not ashamed of the gospel of
Christ because it is the power of God
that brings salvation to everyone who
believes
1 Corinthians
11:1 Paul says "Follow my example as I
follow the example of
Christ." Matthew chapter
9:37-38 Jesus said to his
apostles "The harvest is plentiful but
the workers are few ask the Lord of the
harvest to send out workers into the
field
i think the Bible is abundantly clear
what the main thing is the main thing
there's no doubt that he wants us to go
out and to
evangelize there's no doubt about
it it's not a
suggestion it's not a even a
request it's a commandment
and if we fail to do
that we're disobeying a commandment that
Jesus gave all of
us so it is our responsibility to
evangelize 1 John 4:9 says "We should
love others because he first loved
us." It's not an option it's a command
so the question
is how do we find our
wheelhouse how do we find our our
our real strength because when he says
we should go out into the whole world
and and preach the
gospel I'm not capable of doing
that you
know I can't preach to
everybody i can't teach everybody
there's certain people that I really am
not going to reach at least not very
well but there are certain groups of
people that I work really well with uh
as crazy as it
seems I work really good with
teenagers especially middle
school you know if you teach
school and you're going middle school
you got to be crazy man that's my
wheelhouse that is my wheelhouse put me
with a group of teenagers put me with a
group of middle schoolers and I'm all
over it i have found out through the
years that that's my
wheelhouse what is
yours what is your wheelhouse who do you
relate to the best who do you
communicate with the best who do you
feel the most comfortable around that's
your wheelhouse those are the people
that you need to reach because you can
reach people I cannot
reach it's a simple
fact you put me in a room full of little
ones it's not going to be a pretty
sight you're going to drag me out of
there i mean I I can't I there's I just
that's not my wheelhouse i'll be honest
with you you put me in a room full of
adults and it's a little
iffy my wheelhouse is where I know my
strength is and so that's where I focus
my energy and that's what we all need to
do if we're all supposed to be
lifeguards find your
wheelhouse who is it for Mr ben florida
Bible Camp that's his wheelhouse
he is a different man i got to witness
it firsthand last year he is a different
man at Bible
camp it was amazing it was absolutely
amazing for other people man working
with the you know young marrieds i look
at Chaz and Bethany and they work with
that young marriage
group that's their wheelhouse
some of you work really good with
adults some of you work really good with
the senior
saints right we all have our strengths
and I think God is saying "What is your
strength
go and evangelize." I would have never
dreamed 32 years ago or 34 years ago
that my wheelhouse would be Central
America that would have never shown up
on my on my radar i had no
idea but my wife and I moved to Miami
Florida and without me knowing about it
Miami prepared me for the
culture of Latin America and the
Hispanic way of doing things and I
didn't even realize it at the time but
Miami Florida we were there for 6 years
and it was molding me and getting me
ready to do something that I did not
think I would ever do in my entire life
okay so you can break mission work into
I break it into three groups we have
local outreach
some of you are really good working with
people that live in the
community like really
good
stateside some of you travel on business
trips some of you take vacations or
maybe we go and assist a sister
congregation with a meeting that they're
doing or a door-nocking outreach or a
vacation Bible school there's lots and
lots of opportunities we can go and work
in various states helping build the
community of faith and then of course
there's foreign mission work and you got
the shortterm and the long term uh the
short-term people we go and we spend a
week or two and we work and we do our
thing and we come back but there's
people that that live down there
full-time like Rex when he went to
Africa long-term foreign missions it's
not meant for everybody all of us don't
need to get ready to pack up our bags
and go to
Zimbabwe after hearing some of Rex's
stories don't really want to go to
Zimbabwe he scared me not all of you are
going to want to pack up and go to
Honduras totally
understandable that may not be your
wheelhouse but for some of us it is and
for those that that is our wheelhouse
that is our mission that is our
evangelism that is our mission and we
have to go and we've got to do it
because that is what we've been designed
to do and God has already
prepared your work that's the most
amazing part of all he's already been
there he's already planned and
prepared whoever it is and wherever it
is it's already been planned out the
only thing stopping the plan many times
is
ourselves where is your power zone what
is your target area is it the youth
young married college young
professionals young families empty
nesters senior
saints which one is your wheelhouse and
if you don't
know you need to
listen because God is calling
you and he's telling you he's preparing
things for you sometimes the best thing
we can ever do is just stop and
listen because God will show it to you
clearly he really
will the second part of our
consideration tonight is maintaining a
healthy congregation
mission work is the
strongest when the
church is the
strongest it's very difficult for you to
help someone else if you
yourself are not if you're not in very
good shape right you got to take care of
yourself first we got to take care of
Creekide first we have to have a healthy
vibrant growing congregation and that
starts right here and it starts with the
person next to you the person in front
of you and the person behind
you that's where it
starts okay the growth of the local
congregation is vital to the success of
any evangelism outreach a healthy
church is Christ
centered in teaching and application it
is not
selfserving nor is it
self-inclusive a healthy church is open
to everyone and our focus is on the
outward community and how we can
minister to
them that's the sign of a healthy church
number two a healthy church has a strong
Bible program for all ages a healthy
church has teachers who are well-versed
and knowledgeable in their grade levels
and in what they're
teaching and without a healthy Bible
school
program a congregation is not a healthy
church
number three a healthy church has a
vibrant spiritually uplifted worship
assembly sermons are biblically based
songs are uplifting and edifying and the
worship experience is motivating and
inspirational
inspirational to all age
groups to all age groups rex that's not
hard to do is it it's not hard hitting
all those in one shot
uh it's kind of tough but a strong
healthy congregation is going to have
that we're going to have a great worship
assembly we're going to be we're going
to hear a a a motivated lesson that's
going to
really hit home it's going to prick our
hearts might even step on you might even
have to wear some steeltoed boots every
now and then when you come
in because sometimes what we need to
hear is going to hurt a little bit and
that's the that's the time we need to
hear it the
most church I grew up in
Huntsville man steel Totoed Boots was
like standard equipment when you went in
um our preacher laid it on the
line and evangelism was at the front of
everything that we
did some of the older people in here um
you might remember growing up and going
out and knocking doors anybody remember
that
boy 16 year 17 year old
kid knocking on a door inviting people
to church
i was way out of my comfort zone i was
way out of my comfort zone we had gospel
meetings that lasted an entire
week and people would take off time from
work and we would have more people at
the gospel meeting than we would have on
a Sunday morning worship
assembly man it was awesome we had
gospel singings
congregations around Husville would
would would host singings and everybody
would go and there was nothing like
sitting in a crowd of a couple thousand
people singing man there's just nothing
like it but it everything that we did
always came back to one
thing evangelism every single
time every single time reaching
out being a
lifeguard seeking and
saving i've always wanted to say this
Rex number next I've lost count a
healthy
church has a strong
leadership from ministry leaders to
elders to deacons to volunteers to a
strong congregation it has to be well
organized to be successful it's got to
be successful in
communication it has to be successful in
implementing designed ministry points of
effort if we want to be a healthy
growing church we've got to have that
i'm not saying we do i'm not saying we
don't i'm just identifying the
traits so far I think Creek Creekide is
doing pretty good in my opinion I think
we're doing pretty good i think we have
a pretty healthy church
here a healthy church reflects the
community around
it there is true fellowship that
stretches beyond stereotypical
boundaries such as race and
culture man I grew up in the deep south
in the 60s
i know there's at least one man in here
that's going to understand exactly what
I'm saying where I grew up we had white
churches and we had black
churches and there was no intermingling
with that was that was it like that
yeah i saw white churches that met in
neighborhoods that was predominantly
black and that church congregation did
not reflect their community
whatsoever if you want a strong healthy
congregation you have to reflect the
community around us and I give Creekide
an
A+ i do
a healthy church has a strong mission
program the mission program reaches out
locally it reaches out statewide and it
reaches out to foreign works members are
actively involved in all areas
evangelism outreach at all levels and in
all demographics if you want to have a
healthy church you have to have a strong
missions
program in my honest opinion my my
humble opinion mission training begins
with the youth
group our young people have to be taught
and trained how to become
missionaries because someday they're
going to grow up and they're going to go
off to college and they're going to get
married and they're probably going to
move away and they're not going to come
back to Creekide i mean we would love
for you to come back to Creekide but
chances are they're going to grow up and
and go to church somewhere else and if
they've been immersed and trained and
has experience in mission work they will
take all of that knowledge and training
with
them to the next church that they're
going to work with and that's how
evangelism is going to grow in the
churches of
Christ i'm just telling you that's the
way it is
so let me go to our original scripture
of 2 Corinthians chapter 12 12- 27 i
really am sorry that was such a long
reading you did a great job i felt
really bad about that i know what it's
like when someone does that to
you did you catch what it was talking
about how we are one
body and the arm can't say because I'm
not the head I'm not going to do I'm not
going to do anything or the eye says if
I can't be the tongue I quit if I'm not
this if I'm not that and and the point
was driven home you have to have it all
in order for the body to function
properly you have to have all those
pieces working in harmony and in unity
together that's the only way the body
will survive that's the only way the
body will work
properly so let's compare that to our
wheelhouse so to speak
if everybody in here was just
unbelievably good at teaching
um you know the first principles class
like Rey
does if all of us did
that think of all the other ministries
that are not going to take
place you see what I'm saying
if everybody focused only on the youth
group what happens to everybody
else so what we need is diversification
we need people to work in your area of
strengths and we divide and we do our
work
together and we become a fully
functioning body of
Christ and that's how we reach out and
that's how we convert the
lost one person at a
time so what is your wheelhouse i hope
that you're thinking right now i'm
talking to every single one of us in
here every one of
us you're a lifeguard what is your
strength is it your friends at school is
it a co-orker is it somebody that that
you may you know maybe a business person
that you work with is it your next door
neighbor it could be your own
family where is your
wheelhouse and if you know what it
is get
started there is no reason that we would
have any problem filling this room aired
any Sunday if we would just go out and
do what we've been asked to
do we sit in this great big auditorium
with lots of empty seats and all those
seats belong to somebody out there that
hasn't been brought in yet
so we need to do
it we need to do it i'll finish with one
more story see what time do I have
here i don't want to go over okay I
got I was working as a youth minister
several years ago in Nashville
Tennessee and I was hired to be the
youth minister my job was part-time the
elders said "We want you to teach the
Sunday morning Bible class with the
teenagers we want you to make sure you
do an activity with them once a month i
said "Okay what else you want me to do?"
They're like "That's
it teach Bible class on Sundays one
activity a month." I said "That's all
you want me to do?" They're like "That's
all we expect out of
you." I said "Can I do more?" And they
said "If you want to." So I immediately
got my youth group and I said "Okay we
got to start bringing your friends you
need to go to school and you need to
start bringing your friends i want to
see you bringing a friend i want you to
I need to see your friends and slowly
but surely the youth group started to
grow now the congregation was about 250
and we met in a building that held over
500
people and slowly but surely the youth
group started to grow and they all sat
together you know and we started taking
up more and more
rows and I went to the elders i said
'You know Lipscom University is right
down the street why don't we have a
college
ministry and they're like we don't know
i said I think we need to start a
college
ministry since I only teach Sunday
mornings with the youth group could I
teach a Wednesday night college class
just to see what happens and they're
like yeah we could do that so we hit
Libskum's campus and we started inviting
people to come and slowly but surely the
college group started to come and
started to grow and they got bigger and
bigger and they started occupying more
and more
seats and then I had members coming
up telling me that they were very
uncomfortable with what was going on
who are all these people and why are
they coming here and why are they taking
up all of our seats and why are we
singing songs that only they know and
they started grumbling and complaining
and I actually had one of the elders
came up and
said "Let's cool
it." And I said "You're gonna have to be
more specific what are you telling
me we're stopping it we're stopping it i
said "Okay so what do we what do you
want us what do you want me to do?" And
they said "Well we want you to talk to
all the college kids and tell them find
another place to go to
church and we want you to talk to all
these kids that are not part of our
group and tell them to find another
church to go to."
So I said "With all due respect sir if
you want that said you're going to have
to say it because I'm not going to say
that
because that goes against everything I
believed
in." And they said "Well we're not going
to tell them." I said "Well I'm not
either." And our building was full i
mean standing room only and then I guess
maybe the straw that broke the back is
we held a youth
event and we had over 600 people
come we had people in the aisleway we
had people in the lobby we had people
stood along the walls and I mean it was
so inspirational the singing was
unbelievable the lesson was
incredible it wasn't long after that I
wasn't working at that church anymore
they were uncomfortable with
growth that's something we have to
decide we can fill this
building but do you want it to be
filled are you ready and willing to fill
this
building sadly I can tell you today that
that congregation doesn't exist anymore
they shut their doors about about a few
months ago because they just shrank and
shrank and shrank and they dwindle down
to nobody and they they shut their
door that's what happens if you don't
grow if you don't grow you experience uh
entropy and you start to shrink and the
only way that to keep that from
happening is to keep growing
so push yourself out of your comfort
zone and let's do what God commanded us
to
do and let's be a
lifeguard and let's reach out to those
that are literally
drowning and if they were to die they
would die without
Christ so that's my lesson i think
that's my last slide even i think I'm
still under time i didn't know how far
this would go or how long it would
take so let's wrap it
up if I stepped on your toes there is no
apology if I motivated you in any
way I'll be your strongest teammate
but let's go and let's do the job that
God has already prepared for us
