uh Paul David trip who writes this book
said this recognizing what you are
unable to
do is essential to good parenting and
that's basically what we're talking
about tonight and that is insufficient
principles what am I not capable of
doing some do not know that they are
insufficient in any way they think
they're
fine I heard recently about a 5year old
boy named Nick had come home from
spending two weeks at
prek and he proudly announced to his
grandmother who was watching him that
day he said uh uh that he was the
smartest kid in the
class and his grandmother said well uh
is that what your teacher said and
smiling from ear to ear and he said no
ma'am I had to tell
her sometimes we don't know know that
we're insufficient and some do not know
why they are insufficient and that's a
problem too a girl was in tears when she
came to her father and she said to him
dad you gave me terrible advice I
thought you were smart about money but
you gave me terrible advice well what
did I tell you sweetheart well you told
me to put my money in that big Bank
and now the bank is in
trouble what are you talking about
sweetheart that's one of the largest
banks in the world surely you're
mistaken what is it that you've heard
said no dad I don't think I'm wrong they
just returned one of my checks with a
note saying insufficient
funds the bank's going
under having feelings of inadequacy it's
hard sometimes to accept that it might
be
me that I might be the inadequate one
but the truth is is that I am the
inadequate one and I am
insufficient and I am inadequate and
that's
normal not only is it true but it's
normal just try to be who you
are not who others expect you to
be because you are are insufficient but
so is everybody
else know your boundaries and limits no
one exceeds their capacity
easily except who you are not no one can
be someone else
anyway embrace your unique life path
your inadequacy is unique just like
everybody
else's am I insufficient in being being
able and just ask yourself this question
am I insufficient in being able to cause
lasting change in anyone but
particularly am I able to cause lasting
change in my
child I can shout a
sermon but that doesn't make it
effective just because I rais my voice
doesn't mean you're going to listen
better in fact a lot of times that just
turns people off only God can change a
heart not a loud
sound I can scare and shout and I can
even curse at a child but only God can
change a heart I can bribe I can guilt a
child I can shame a child but only God
can change a heart I can shout Jesus at
a possessed child or one I thinks
virtually possessed because they so mean
but only God can cure that heart I can
shout Jesus at my sick child but I
better take him to the doctor because
only God can change and truly heal a
heart I can shout Jesus at my sinful
child but only God can forgive their
heart forgive their sins I can shout
Jesus at my atheistic child but only God
can save their heart I can shout Jesus
at my Rebel child but only God God can
change their heart I can be a tool for
Jesus but the real power is God's and
only God can change a
heart
so never think that you're doing this
parenting alone that's a huge
mistake and therefore because you're not
doing the parenting alone don't doubt
your efforts don't believe your efforts
alone do it
that's not the point but don't doubt
your efforts we're not doing what we do
alone Matthew
28 and verse 20 says I with you always
even to the End of the Age Mark
16:20 they went out and preached
everywhere while the Lord worked with
them and confirmed the words by the
signs that followed the Lord works with
us still to this day John
14:8 I will not leave you orphan S I
will come to you Philippians 1:6 being
confident of this very thing that he who
begun a good work in you will complete
it until the day of Jesus Christ he's
not abandoned us he's still working with
us Hebrews 135 I will never leave you
nor forsake you so you may think you've
got this all by yourself but that's not
true not on any level if you'll let him
in to help you but it is possible it is
possible to leave God and leave God out
of our parenting we can leave you out of
everything if we want 1 Timothy 4:1 says
some will depart from the faith so you
can do
it second Peter 2 verse1 said even
denying the Lord so you can do
it Hebrews 3:12 says in departing from
the Living God so you can do it you can
walk away you can part you can turn your
back and deny the Lord so really this
lesson is really real simple tonight it
may sound like I'm going to be profound
but I'm not not that I ever am but but
basically I want to look at seven proofs
or EV evidences or advocacies for the
idea of these insufficient
principles because we need we really
need to get a grip on this because I'm
afraid if you don't recognize how
insufficient you are you're going to
either feel terrible all the time or
you're going to think you're pretty hot
stuff and either one of those are a
terrible place to be so let's walk
through it number oh I did went too
fast that's it John 15 1-5 you might
turn there and read with me if you wish
John 15 1-5 beginning with verse one it
says I am the True Vine and my father is
the vine dresser every branch in me that
does not bear fruit he takes away and
every branch that bears fruit he prunes
that it may bear more fruit you are
already clean because the word which I
have spoken to you abide in me and I in
you as and this is the important part as
the branch that is you and me cannot
bear fruit of itself we just can't do it
unless that abides in the vine neither
can you unless you abide in me I am the
vine you are the branches he who abides
in me and I in him Bears much fruit for
without me you can do
nothing Jesus in your
home that's
it if Jesus is not in your home that's
an insufficient childhood
period it's not going to be enough it's
not I'm not telling you that if you keep
Jesus in your home put him up on the
wall that every one of your kids will be
a Christian I'm not saying that I'm
saying without him it's almost
impossible almost impossible number
two parenting without God's gospel is
insufficient for the task you've been
given so if you're raising your kid
without Jesus you're going to have
trouble you may have trouble with Jesus
but let me tell you without the gospel
it's insufficient Romans 1:16 says for I
am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ
for it is the power of God to Salvation
for everyone who believes for the Jew
first and also for the Greek so the
gospel is what Saves The Gospel is what
changes so the idea of parenting without
ever talking about the gospel is
insufficient it's
insufficient you're not going to be able
to leave the kids to Christ and rais
them as strongly as they could be they
it's just not possible it's essential
because without it you're insufficient
for the task cuz you're not the one
making the changes you can't make the
changes it's him that makes them number
next parenting without God's increase is
insufficient listen to 1 Corinthians
chapter 3 I'm just driving the same nail
in every time going hit this verses 5-
11 says who then is Paul and who is
Apollos but ministers through whom you
believe they're nobody they're just the
guys who taught you as the lord gave to
each one I planted polish watered but
God gave the increase the only growth
the only change happened from God verse
seven so then neither he who plants is
anything he's claiming that aplace who
he's not
he's nothing or is he who
waters you know no but God who gives the
increase neither one of them or anything
but God who gives the increase now he
who plants and he who waters are one
they should be United and each one will
receive his own reward according to his
own labor God rewards labor that's the
whole chapter chapter three if you keep
reading it verse 9 for we are God's
fellow workers you are God's field you
are God's Building God's God Gods
according to the grace of God which was
given to me as a wise master builder I
have laid the foundation he's talking
about their particular congregation and
another Builds on it there are other
people going to teach but let each one
take heed how he builds on it for no
other Foundation can anyone lay than
that which is laid which is Jesus
Christ uh the idea of
increase neither
parents nor children can grow without
Christ not properly so parents and
children must be in
Christ now you say well I wasn't in
Christ I raised my kids outside of
Christ and they're all Christians now
well then somebody else had an impact I
tell you what somebody had an
impact let's go to the next one I think
you're going to get this point it's just
driving the same point home parenting
without God's
fragrance is insufficient efficient I
love this passage 2 Corinthians chap 2:
14-6 if you haven't noticed it you
should pay close attention to this it
says in verse
14 now it is up there right yes now
thanks be to God who always leads us in
Triumph in Christ and through us
diffuses the fragrance of his knowledge
in every place and a nice way of saying
it verse 15 for we are to to God the
fragrance of Christ among those who are
being saved and among those who are
perishing to the one we are the aroma of
death leading to death and to the other
the aroma of Life leading to life and
who is sufficient for these things you
know this is going to sound maybe
strange but I think it is
true you can walk in a house well I
believe this is true let me go further I
I I'll I'll get back to the house in a
minute I believe you can look at
somebody and tell whether or not they
trying to follow Jesus or
not I can think you can hear in their
voice I can tell it at a McDonald's if
I'm talking to somebody who goes to
church I can tell it at uh
Walmart I can tell it's a different
demeanor here's what I'm trying to say
there's this there's an aroma
around people who are trying to do
what's
right there is an aroma in a
home what kind of Aroma do you have it's
either an aroma that makes Jesus smell
good or the house
stinks of death because everybody's
going to go to hell that's great right
that's not the place you want to be
nobody wants to be raised in a house
where it feels like hell rather than
heaven
been in that house raised in that house
number
next parenting without God's spirit is
insufficient picking up in verse one of
second Corinthians chapter
3 I'm reading a little more than I think
that's up there I'm not sure Do We Begin
Again to commend ourselves this is Paul
just talking about himself for a minute
or do we need as some others Epistles of
commendation to you or letters of
commendation from you do I need really
need a letter from another church to
tell you I'm a decent
person verse two you are our epistle
written in our hearts known and bread by
all men if you want to know what I'm
like everybody just take a look at you
that's what he's saying verse three
clearly you're an Epistle of Christ
ministered by US Written not with ink
but by the spirit of the Living God not
in tables of stone but on tables of
Flesh that is of the heart if I've
really done my job he's
saying people can tell God is in you and
therefore God is in me that's what he's
really saying the spirit of God verse
four and we have such trust through
Christ toward God not that we are
sufficient so it's back to that point
it's not me we are not sufficient I am
insufficient for for the task that God
has given me I am insufficient to be
your minister I am insufficient to be
I'm old enough but to be an elder for
example I'm insufficient to do a lot of
things I'm insufficient to be a good
father I'm insufficient not that we are
sufficient of ourselves that's his point
so if I do make it sufficiency to do the
job it wasn't me not that we are
sufficient of ourselves to think of
anything as being from ourselves but our
sufficiency is from God if I ever do it
right it was God in Me doing it right it
wasn't me who also made us sufficient as
Ministers of the New Covenant not of the
letter but of the spirit for the letter
kills but the spirit gives life dropping
down to verse 18 but we all with unveil
face behold as in a mirror the glory of
the Lord are being transformed Med into
the same image from glory to glory just
as by the spirit of the Lord God is
having an impact upon us all he is
changing us all I have never changed
anyone I have never saved
anyone I have not been the one that has
made my kids turn out halfway right was
not me
Zechariah
4:6 not by might nor by power but by my
spirit says the Lord of
host the spirit the attitude the heart
of your children need God's spirit not
yours so the more you get involved
without his Spirit the less likely
they're going to buy into any of
this y'all all know that I had a a
mental problem y'all I've told you
enough about that that I had a serious
problem at one point one of the hardest
things that I learned in that that I did
not want to
learn and it's it was an important
lesson for me but it was a hard
one there was nothing in
me
worthy worthy of what worthy of my
wife worthy of my
children worthy of being
saved worthy because what happened to me
is the more my brain got messed up the
further away from God I was and the less
I was allowing him to control and that's
what I mean by that it was only God's
influence on
me that made any part of me
worthy it was only that
influence that made anybody want to be
around
me that's a hard lesson to accept but
you should try it on sometime because
it's true of you too if it's just you we
don't want
you you hear
me if you're just going to be you
without
God we don't need
you you're not
helpful but With God all of a sudden we
love you and we want to be around you
because it's that influence of God on
you that makes you a
blessing and if you think it's different
than that that's part of the problem I'm
talking about tonight if you think it's
you that's part of the problem and you
will only damage your kids until you
recognize the other is actually
true let me go to the last point or it's
not the last point but nearly the last
Point y'all won nearly the last Point
don't you all right parenting without
God's grace is
insufficient it says in Ephesians
chapter 2 you know this passage really
well verses 8 through1 read the whole
thing verses 1-10 but just verse 8-10
for by Grace you've been saved through
faith and that not not of yourselves in
other words you couldn't do it you can't
do it not of yourselves it's the gift of
God not of Works lest anyone should
boast if you could do it yourself then
you could boast about it yeah I saved
myself I was baptized I lived faithful I
went to church Sunday morning Sunday
night Wednesday night I was faithful
that's why I went to heaven no it
ain't no it's not verse 10 for we are
his workmanship created in Christ Jesus
for good works we were made to do that
but that's not why we're saved which God
prepared beforehand that we should walk
in them children here's the thing that
that you really need to get on
Grace children need your unmerited
favor if if they've got to Merit your
favor that's not
Grace right well we all know what Grace
means right unmar favor
right if they they've got to Merit your
favor that's not Grace that's
works that's them earning their their
place with you that's them earning their
salvation if you will but if salvation
is unmerited favor that you don't really
earn but it's actually a gift and that
God does it if that's really true what
you believe which some of you probably
don't believe that but if you that's
really what you believe then you know
that you can't be saved without his
unmar favor what do you so you can't
have a relationship with a father
without an unmar favor what do you think
about your children can they not they
have to have your unmar favor they don't
have to do everything right for you to
love them right they don't have to do
everything right for you to be good to
them
no if you treat them though like they
do good luck number
last parenting without God's fullness is
insufficient in Colossians chapter 2
veres 9 and 10 it says for in him that
is in Christ dwells all the fullness of
the godhead bodily that means that God
and the spirit all dwelt within him
while he was on Earth fully he was
filled in fact we're told in John had
the spirit without measure whatever that
means and I don't actually know what
that means for in him dwells all the
fullness of the godhead bodily verse 10
and you are complete in him in other
words all you need is Jesus and then
you're complete and you are complete
plead in him who is the head of the all
principality and Powers so children are
not finished until they're filled and
the only thing that they really need to
be filled with is him they don't need to
be filled with you your philosophy your
thinking all the things that you know
are smart that's not what they need they
might that might be helpful from time to
time but that's not what they need what
they need is him that's it so that's the
lesson tonight pretty simple so
parenting without God's presence that's
going to be insufficient without his
gospel it will be insufficient without
his increase there won't be increase
it'll be insufficient without his
fragrance that smell of the house it'll
be insufficient without the spirit your
attitude the way it should be it'll be
insufficient without Grace it'll be
insufficient without fullness it'll be
insufficient now I want to tell you
something all that's hard to me I look
at all of that and I'm going to be
honest with you that sounds tough to me
that's a tough place in many respects
cuz I'm looking at that and I'm going
but I thought I had an influence I
thought I changed and and but I've
looked back and I'm like no I don't
think it was anything to do with
me only as I became his tool only
them and Expos them to
him and when I Expos them to him that
was something
good and if I behaved according to his
Israel and I exposed them to that that
was
good but when you think about that just
a second then you realize it wasn't me
at all was
it it it wasn't me at
all and so therefore nothing without me
you can do
nothing that's right that's absolutely
true so yes we cannot change
Hearts but let me let me back up now and
give you something to hang your hat on
so you don't walk away from this feeling
really bad uh we are laborers together
with God to change hearts and to change
the hearts of our children our parents
our in-laws our Outlaws and anybody we
know to somehow have Christ imprinted on
their soul we just want Christ to be
imprinted on their
soul we don't do this by
ourselves it's a big mistake
to think you're doing it by yourself
even if you're a single parent you're
not doing it by
yourself we do not do this by ourselves
we must do
something else nothing will be done to
help them so I'm not advocating well God
you just do it and I'll just sit back
and watch that's not what I'm suggesting
but you've got to understand that you
got to do something but you don't do it
alone I've been watching in football a
long time some of youall been watching
do y'all remember when it was at the
Super Bowl it was called the world's
Championship any of y'all remember that
you remember when Bart Star and Johnny
Unitus were playing you remember those
games and that one game in the snow
where they crossed the the goal line
just seconds to go and scored a
touchdown on a quarterback Snake well I
I was reading about Johnny Unitas y'all
know Johnny unit some of y'all how many
you know Johnny Unitus raise your hand
ah more people than that these young
people are going who in the world's
Johnny unas Johnny unus um what you
might not know about him he could have
thought that he was pretty inadequate
because he was cut from the pitb
Pittsburgh Steelers and sent home with
$10 for his bus
fair that was it go
home they said he was too
skinny he was too slow
and he didn't have the arm for it I
always thought he looked funny hunched
over kind of thing you know what I'm
talking about everybody know Johnny
United sty and
uh but Johnny never
quit his first game listen to this this
actually happened his first game with
the Baltimore Colts he threw an
interception on the very first play now
this is your first game in the NFL what
do you do your first play you throw an
interception
on the next two series he
fumbled both
series but he never quit in one game his
nose was broken so they put him on the
sidelines right his nose was broken he
had a concussion so it wasn't wasn't
just his nose was broken it's a mean
game back then do y'all remember it was
a little meaner than it is Mean Joe
Green anybody that wasn't a joke okay it
was a mean game back then his nose was
broken he had a concussion and a tooth
or more was sticking through his
lip his lower lip I said upper lip his
lower lip his coach he said to his coach
I got to go back into the game
coach and the goat says looks at him and
blood's pouring down I mean he's a
mess and he says
why and Johnny said look at the
scoreboard
we're
behind unius then Coach let him back in
crazy with his concussion and his tooth
sticking through his lower lip he
reached down and grabbed some mud and
shoved it on his lip into the
hole to stop it from
bleeding he then ran out to the Huddle
and this is what he
said just block and we will win the
game and he
won now here's the thing did Johnny unit
us win that
game what if they hadn't a
blocked I don't care how much effort he
put into it I don't care how much effort
you're putting into your
parenting you can have a tooth through
your lower lip your nose could be broke
and you could have a concussion and you
may feel like you're doing it
all but somebody's got a block for you
and somebody's got to catch the
ball you don't do this
alone you don't really do anything
important
alone your mate helps you your family
helps you the church helps you but
listen to me clearly no they
don't he he helps
you they're just tools just like you and
if you don't approach it that way you're
going to be very sad at the end because
if you do approach it that way and it
doesn't work
out you can go to bed at night I gave it
all to the Lord and it didn't work
out but if you don't do it that way
you'll be going I don't
know maybe I did that
I don't want to live like that do
you on anything so get involved in your
child's life but realize you don't do it
alone you need Divine help to do a
Divine job which is to put a little bit
of divinity into the soul of a very
fleshly little
child and believe me we're all pretty
fleshly we're all pretty worldly and it
takes a lot to help somebody to decide
that they're going to follow with all
their heart the Lord Jesus if you're
here tonight you've never given your
life to the Lord we'd love to give you
an opportunity to do that repent of your
sins confess the name of Christ be
baptized you know your need I don't know
what it is but bottom line to this
lesson is we all need God don't we
