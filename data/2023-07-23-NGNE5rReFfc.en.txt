all right so I ENT titled this uh big
picture faith and uh if you want to turn
to Psalm 73 we're going to be reading
from Psalm 73
today but before we
begin I wanted to tell you a story uh
and I'm sure maybe some of you have seen
this this uh video before or heard this
story but we we've all taken an exam
before yeah and you're writing your exam
and you're behind and you're in trouble
so there's this this young man he's
writing his exam and he's behind in time
and eventually the time is up and the
lecture says all right time's up
pencil's
down and the good students put their
pencils down and they get up and they go
and hand their papers in and this one
young man he just keeps writing keeps
going keeps going keeps going all right
young man pencils down and he ignores
him and he keeps going he keeps going he
keeps going and eventually the lecture
is just like shouting at him put your
pencil down and the young man just keeps
going eventually when the young man is
finished puts his pencil down he walks
up to the
lecturer and holding his paper and the
lecturer says no you're not handing your
paper and you're getting zero because I
told you to put your pencil down a long
time ago and the young man says do you
know who I
am and the lecturer says no no this
young man says do you know who my father
is there says no he says are you're
telling me you don't know who I am and
the leex says no and with that he grabs
a stack of papers lifts it about halfway
and shoves his paper in and puts it down
and walks
out and we see in this story the one who
wasn't doing the right thing he gets
away with
and isn't that so too in
life I'm going to read some statistics
to you according to the watch world
watch list statistics in 2020 to 2021
Christian killings were up
24% churches were attacked were up to
14% Christians arrested without trial or
up to 44% this is just between 2020 and
2021 get this one Christian kidnappings
were up
124% in 2021 to
2022 Nigeria
alone had 6,000 Christians hacked to
death in 2023 uh we see the persecution
in the Christian world one in seven
Christians worldwide apparently suffer
persecution of some sort one in five
Christians in Africa two in five
Christians in Asia suffer
persecution and one has to ask the
question where is God in all
this we see people suffering I know we
have people suffering here today I know
people are struggling with
things and when when we're when we're in
that depth of in the depth of
suffering our our suffering seems
exaggerated and when we describe it as
this exaggeration that we have and and
it's hard I lost a I lost a friend I I
buried a loved one I lost my job I you
know I'm suffering with illnesses I
could die
anytime we're all going through
something so asive or asafe or I don't
really know how to pronounce his name
but I'm going to say ASF he writes this
Psalm
73 and uh just to give you a back on an
as if you read 1st Chronicles 15 uh
1625 2 Chronicles 29 we see that assf
was quoting the chief of the worship in
the Tabernacle under David and
Solomon this is this guy's high up in
the
Tabernacle right and he writes this
Psalm and I want to go through this
Psalm but keep in mind his position in
the church he's high up there and I know
a lot of us look up to those the
leadership in the church and we we think
think oh they they've got it together
you know they they're leading us they
know what they're
doing I want you to see how ASF is
struggling so let's go to Psalm 73 verse
one read with
me truly God is good to
Israel to those who are pure in
heart he start off with such a truth
statement truly God is good to Israel to
those who are pure in heart and he's
right God is
good very next line
but as for me my feet had almost
stumbled my steps had nearly slipped we
have asive the chief of the worship that
that's in the Tabernacle he is
struggling he's struggling with
something right his feet nearly slipped
or his steps had nearly slipped he's
losing his
faith for I was envious of the Arrogant
when I saw the prosperity of the
wicked it seems like God is good to the
wicked which is
unfair you know ASF is is working hard
for the
Lord but now all of a sudden I see the
prosperity of the
wicked for they have no pains until
death sounds like they have peaceful
debts their bodies are fat and Sleek
they are not in trouble as as others are
they are not stricken like the rest of
mankind they appear to be more blessed
than
us and therefore pride is their necklace
violence covers them as a
garment I'm sure many of you have seen
in the world today you see people
walking around like this maybe you watch
some videos or movies of of people
covering themselves in Pride and gold
and jewelry and nice cars and and
threatening violence with guns and
knives and all sorts of
things and their pride is their necklace
they wear this with pride they wear
their wickedness
as though it's something to be boastful
about in verse 7even their eyes swell
out through fatness they have so much
they have so much food they have so much
money have you seen these uh
influences burning
money or throwing out food and I'm
thinking you know that could help
someone that could help someone in need
we just got back from Honduras with uh
tesar and Margaret
Reeves that's Terry for that's the
Australian translation
Tesa um but we see poverty we see people
that are struggling to eat and then I
see the wicked
wasting and this is what ASF is
seeing the eyes swell out through
fatness their hearts overflow with
folies they scoff and speak with malice
loftily they threaten
oppression do you listen to some of the
music
today some of the music that's coming
out uh wow young people be careful what
you're singing along to because you
don't know what kind of covenants you're
making with the
devil and yet these are glorified right
these kinds of songs that that talk
about violence and disrespecting woman
and all this kind of stuff is
glorified and we cannot in public
schools pray through
Jesus and yet we're glorifying these
kinds of songs and I'm thinking how did
the wicked get away with this how is
this allowed and you know what I'm
talking
about ASF is having the same problem
there is nothing new Under the Sun
they scoff and speak with malice loftily
they threaten
oppression they set their mouths
against the
heavens and their tongue struts through
the
Earth last week re spoke about how
dangerous the tongue can
be their tongues strut through the Earth
they have influence over people people
listen to these people there these
Wicked people doing horrible things
people seem to turn to them for advice
what this doesn't make sense we're here
doing the right thing we're here obeying
God's word we're here you know
struggling day in day out and they
are reaping Wicked disgusting filthy
things in the world that are affecting
us and people seem to glorify that how
unfair is this
World verse
10 therefore his people turn back to
them and find no fault in
them and they say how can God know how
can God
know is there knowledge in the most
high they are mocking
God who is this God he's nowhere to be
seen have you guys seen any of these
these Hollywood
shows this borderline demonic stuff
that's coming out
lately and they mock
God and the wickedness of the world
seems to be
escalating there's nothing new Under the
Sun now I I listen to Richard Dawkins
sometimes he's a quite a well-known
atheist I'm going to quote him this is
horrible but he says the God he wrote
the uh The God Delusion and he writes
the god of the Old Testament is arguably
the most unpleasant character in all
fiction jealous and proud of it a petty
unjust unforgiving control freak a
vindictive bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser
misogynistic homophobic a racist I I
don't like reading this out but you get
the
point they mock God and they seem to
have an easy life and here we are at
church day in they out we're trying our
best and we're struggling and it's not
fair it's not fair verse 12 behold these
are the wicked always at ease they
increase in
riches life seems so easy for these
people what is going on verse 13 all in
vain have I kept my heart
clean in vain have I CLT kept my heart
clean takes my mind to Ecclesiastes
meaningless meaningless meaningless this
whole thing is meaningless Vanity
Vanity you live you
die oh well you live yes here the best
part you create you build up and then
you
die and you give it to your son and then
he just destroys it right thanks
dead but you die all your hard work and
you die just seems like such a waste of
time and and ASF is saying this all in
vain have I kept my heart clean I have
tried my best I'm coming to you
God and washed my hands in
innocence for all day long I have been
stricken I'm
struggling and rebuked every morning
chastened every morning some of your
versions might
say I think of a a member in the church
in Australia in
Perth uh he's got all sorts of problems
blind deaf he can't speak uh he's I
think's he's an
amputee whole bunch of things and that
man is stricken with
suffering and you go to ask the question
what's God
doing
verse 15 if I had said I will speak this
I would have betrayed the generation of
your
children there are days
when ah I am angry I'm frustrated and I
know you are too and there are days when
you need to hold your
tongue because if I had spoken this I
would have betrayed a generation of your
children you break them down
but when I thought how to understand
this it seemed to me a wearisome
task so let me share a story with you
that kind
of ties in with this it's a story about
uh something I
suffered and you actually prayed for me
now I'm not talking about that little
minor lung collapse thing that happened
recently I'm talking about something
back in
2015 and uh we were at Bible study
in uh Perth now I understand Bible study
for us we had to because we're such a
small congregation we'd have to rent out
a building uh not rent out a building
rent out a hall rent out a
room in a recreation
center Now understand a recreation
center there is sports happening there's
a gym in the background so while you're
studying Bible you
hear and people are doing their gym
stuff and
and you're talking about Adam and Eve
and all this kind of stuff right so it
was kind of a busy
place and there's a Wednesday night
bible
study and
uh I heard some commotion
outside and uh I went out to investigate
while everyone was uh studying doing the
Bible study turns out a young man was uh
robbing a bunch of girls who were on
roller skates cuz they were practicing
their roller skate Derby or something
where you go around and you push each
other over crazy stuff but they were
they were being robbed and so I stepped
in help and the next thing his friends
got in and one of them hits a girl and
I'm trying to stop this and next thing
you know I get kicked in the
face and there's blood everywhere it's
like spraying out of me I'm a sprinkler
and I'm kind of embarrassed because now
Bible study is finishing up and I'm
bleeding everywhere and I'm like so I
think I'm the first person in history to
be kicked in the face at Bible study no
anyway but
uh the police arrived and anyway they
they got let
off and uh I ended up in hospital with
uh I I had like little bubbles floating
around ins side my head and I had 36
fractures across the face this guy
kicked me hard and I had uh trauma to
the BL to the brain I had a bleeding on
the
brain and so
I'm now in this hospital and this young
lady comes to me and I'm suffering right
I'm I'm I'm struggling and this young
lady comes to me and she puts a tray
down and she says to me all right Keegan
and it's got a whole bunch of objects on
it and this is where it already dawned
on me this is serious so a whole bunch
of random stuff and she says okay Keegan
can you point to the
scissors and I'm like oh my goodness
they're testing to see if my brain's
messed up now I'm starting to think
maybe I don't know what scissors looks
like anymore and I'm starting to freak
out and I'm like I think it's that one
she's like yeah very good
I'm I'm past it can you pick up the
pencil I don't know if I can but I'm
going to try right I'm
suffering and guess what I'm lying in
the hospital bed I turn on the TV after
this had happened the guy who kicked me
in the face is on
TV being interviewed about how the
police are targeting these young guys
and how it's not fair and they're just
peaceful in the community they don't do
any crime I'm like are you kidding
me I'm here suffering and the news is
glorifying the gods that put me in the
hospital man am I angry about
that and so word got out and this
congregation actually prayed for me
before you knew me so thank
you but I look at this and I think
suffering
what's it all
about and so we get into theodicy this
is what what um ASF is really getting to
this theodicy a Vindication of the
justice of God in ordaining or
permitting natural or moral evil so I'll
talk about three little ones quickly and
we'll move on Soul making theodicy this
idea the trials and temptations that we
need this kind of evil the suffering so
that we can become a better
person right suffering produces
perseverance perseverance character
character produces hope right um it's a
God's way of testing us the master the
ship is made from the tree on the cliff
because it's been beaten by the wind so
much it's strong right so that's the
idea and there's truth to this there is
truth to
this but why then do babies
suffer they aren't old enough to
understand
right so there's truth to this the the Y
but what about punishment
theodicy this idea that we're now
separate from God so because we're
separated from God all his goodness is
over here and we're now faced with
evil and that makes sense there's truth
to
that but then why do the Innocents
suffer there something they didn't do
you know what I'm talking about if you
got a young
sibling you get a hiding or you get a
spanking for something you didn't
do or if you really want to get into
trouble for something you didn't do get
into church
ministry bad joke
okay free will
theodicy we have to have evil so that we
can
choose that makes sense how am I going
to love my wife if I don't understand
what the opposite of Love is
right and that makes sense there's truth
to that but can God create a universe
with free will and no
sin well isn't that what heaven's going
to
be so God can do that too so there seems
to be truth to all three of these that
I've just laid out
so ASF is struggling with this idea of
the wickedness of the world and in verse
17 he says until I went into the
sanctuary of God then I discerned their
end he has to go into the sanctuary of
God the big
picture let me offer you a solution on
this
suffering first we got to understand
job we all know job
has a hard time he loses a
lot a
lot and eventually gets to the point
where he's frustrated with God and God
shows up and God's like hey
Job how many hairs on your head can you
make the Leviathan jump how many goats
are on that mountain uh job how many how
many liters are in the
ocean or should I say gallons sorry how
many gallons are in the
ocean um and job's like um um hey Job
answer me job come on come
on what that tells me there's a point
where I
don't I don't know everything God's
going to do and I'm okay with
that but let me offer you this the worst
suffering that I can think of Revelation
138 and all who dwell on Earth will
worship it every one whose name has not
been written before the found before the
foundation of the world in the Book of
Life of the Lamb who was
slain somehow Jesus was to be slain
before the foundation of the world how
does God see all
that how does he see the
future and the suffering of the
sun now I'm not trying to explain God's
Transcendence I don't understand that
I'm I'm just saying to you is it
possible that God In His Infinite Wisdom
all powerful everywhere he can be he's
able to see the suffering of his son
before it happened and after it happened
over and over and over and over
again now that's suffering not only that
his son was
innocent all the sins of the world the
wrath of God in that one place on Jesus
and God viewing that over and over again
you want to talk about our suffering
let's talk about that
suffering the question becomes why would
God do that to
himself Genesis
1:26 and God said let us make man in our
image and our likeness God the Son and
the Holy Spirit in this Union of Love
have said hey let's make man like us
let's invite them into our Union of Love
we've been invited into this
Union First John 3 says see what kind of
love the father has given to us that we
should be called children of God and so
we
are God with what proof of Love is
it Romans 5 while we were still uh
Sinners or enemies of God Christ died
for
us so you've got God who sees this
suffering and endures it over and over
again
possibly who's invited us into this
Union of love and how does he prove that
love to us how much do you love me Lord
this
much he puts himself on the
cross this is how far he is willing to
go for us that he might take on
suffering to show his love for
us so
ASF he catches
himself take every thought captive to
obey Christ
right when you don't understand you hold
on to what you know so notice ASF uh in
the Psalms I also want you to notice
that his pronouns change now I don't
mean pronouns worldly pronouns I'm
talking about the pronouns and how he's
speaking firstly he starts off with they
they're so wicked they are so bad they
are so mean then he goes to I and I'm
struggling and I I I I I I
I and then he turns to
you and this is where he finds the
solution you truly You Verse 18 truly
you set them in Slippery places uh
remember in verse two Asif almost
slipped with his faith and now he's like
no no no that's not how it works truly
you set them in Slippery places you make
them fall to ruin how they are destroyed
in in a moment Swept Away utterly by
Terrors like a dream when one
awakes ASF is leaning on his faith in
God's
justice because at some point the bill
needs to be
paid
amen the bill is going to be
paid Justice is coming and I for one I'm
glad it's coming and it hasn't come
because when I'm driving over the speed
limit the last thing I'm wishing for is
a cop around the corner to pull me over
and give me a ticket
right Mercy For Me Justice for
them someone comes speeding past you
like I hope there's a copper around the
corner and when the lights go on you're
like who but if it res like oh no
officer I'm you know I'm tired and
please have
mercy
ASF has faith in God's justice that is
coming now what do I mean by faith what
we've talked about with the
youth faith is getting on the
airplane you can look at the statistics
of airplanes and how safe they are and
how they're built and you believe that
it works but at some point you got to
get on and have faith that you're going
to get
there have faith in God's justice this
is point number one because I know we're
all Str struggling with this kind of
stuff lean on God's justice that big
picture look at that big picture again
faith in God's justice and then it goes
on oh Lord when you Rouse yourself you
despise them as Phantoms this is not God
sleeping he's talking about God's
patience in his
Justice when you Rous yourself you
despise them as
Phantoms when my soul was embittered
when I was pricked in in heart I was
brutish and ignorant I was like a beast
towards you I was fighting with God I
was angry with God who's been there
before oh it's just me okay cool The
Sermon Just for me who's been angry with
God
before yeah you know what I mean there
it
is I was fighting with God I was losing
my
faith second Timothy 2:13 if we are
Faith L he remains
faithful for he cannot deny
himself you're going to have some ups
and downs you're going to be angry with
God he remains
faithful that blows my mind I'm
sorry verse 23 nevertheless I am
continually with you you hold my right
hand you guide me with your counsel and
afterwards you will receive me to Glory
you hold my right hand like I'm crossing
the road like a parent would you receive
me to Glory asip has hope in God's
justice he has Faith he has hope and
hope does not disappoint Romans
5 Second point he has hope in God's
justice whom have I in heaven but you
and there is nothing on Earth that I
desire beside you besides you my flesh
and my heart May Fail but God is the
strength of my heart and my portion
forever asf's love for God's
justice I have no one else but you I
love you I want you now when I say God's
love sorry the love for God's
justice what if God chooses to save the
worst of the
worst do you love his Justice enough to
say praise the
Lord because there's going to come a
time when you might say whoa that person
made it
or wow what a wonderful God he is that
he could do that I love his Justice
because he is just and he knows what
he's doing
amen so ASF has faith in God's justice
he has hope in the Justice to come and
he
loves God and what he can
do faith hope and love we heard that
before let's finish up for behold those
who are far from You Shall Perish you
put an end to everyone who is unfaithful
to you but for me it is good to be near
God for I have made the Lord God my
refuge that I may tell of all your works
when you are
struggling when you are feel like you're
losing your
faith remember the big picture it's so
easy to think about me me me they're so
mean I'm so this I deserve
that
you your plan your
ways so it seems to me that God's
justice and his love meet at the
cross thank goodness for
that so let me ask you the question
we'll finish with this can you trust him
who loves you so much it's
easy will you trust him that's the
question Jesus Is The
Answer we're going to struggle we're
going to have our ups and downs where
else are you going to
go he is our everything if you need him
I encourage you to come forward as we
stand as we
sing
