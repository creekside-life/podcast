So a man's wife and his relationship
uh in my opinion will either make or
break a man. Um so I want to tell you a
little bit about somebody that I used to
think was a really great person. I
wasn't my preacher or anything like
that. You'll but you know him. You've
heard his name. So it's not some secret
person. But you probably haven't heard
what I'm going to tell you tonight. Some
of you may have, but it's unlikely. It's
kind of been done quietly.
His name is Dr. Charles Stanley. Dr.
Charles Stanley died in 2023.
Now, Dr. Charles Stanley was known as
the man who knew the truth about God.
He's a TV show in touch with Dr. Charles
Stanley was on for years and years and
years. And um Charles Stanley got a
divorce.
Did you know that?
What happened? According to their son
Andy, who is a preacher of sorts also in
the Atlanta area,
uh said his mother Anna
asked Charles to reconcile by giving up
his ministry and spending his final
years with and for her. because he had
so neglected her through the years
according to the rules of their
particular denomination
that's binding on most what we would
call evangelical
Christian churches but especially
superstar if you will churches
megaurches like he was
um a media company bringing in $35
million a year which is what their
church did
his career as a minister, a cleric
should have been over.
Um,
he recognized that in 1995,
he said this in 1995,
if my wife divorces me, this is how far
back this goes, just so you know, if my
wife divorces me, I would resign
immediately.
It however didn't go down that way.
Um Anna Stanley that was his wife.
She was or he she said he was the
husband who was wasn't there was never
there. She said I have been a faithful
and supportive wife to Charles. And then
she wrote in a 1995 open letter to his
church the following. Long ago, however,
Charles in effect abandoned our
marriage. He chose his priorities, and I
have not been one of them.
The meeting at the church when this
finally went public
was at 6:30 p.m. on Sunday, August the
13, 1995.
Thousands showed up, most of them
supporters of Charles Stanley because he
was beloved by a lot of people. About
3,000 could fit into their sanctuary at
one moment. But they had all the
classrooms and all fit to the overflow
cloud, which they pretty much did. But
at 6 p.m. they had to literally shut the
building, close the doors. There was no
more room for anybody. and the the
auditorium was filled with Stanley
supporters.
Anna's letter to Charles
was ruled out of order and so it was
never read before the congregation.
They never heard from her.
Charles stood up and said, "I am not
divorced." And at that moment, he was
not. I am not divorced. Secondly, I
don't want a divorce. And thirdly, my
wife doesn't want a divorce. I'm
trusting God is going to put this back
together.
Anna, his wife, however, clarified
through the newspaper since she wasn't
allowed to say anything before the
church. The time for and the possibility
of reconciliation between Charles and me
has passed. She added, "I have been
dismayed at my husband's refusal to
accept the critical state of our
marriage. Instead, he has made repeated
announcements from the pullpit that
progress was being made through toward
reconciliation
when in fact the very opposite was true.
I do not choose to contribute to his
charade."
Andy's memoir, Andy's the son, there's a
sister, too, but she won't say much
about this. Andy's memoir has this
particular point about his mom. He said,
"My mom had not attended church for
years
and she he added in the CNN profile,
people got used to it, and they quit
asking about it or about her."
In 2000, the year 2000, the divorce was
finally announced.
In his memoir, Charles Stanley, who
passed away in 23, as I said, said it
was devastating to him when that
happened.
And as a result, and you remember what
he said before, um,
I would resign immediately. As a result,
he mowled over whether or not he should
resign. And then he said this and God
simply said, "You just keep doing what I
called you to do until I tell you
differently." So he never resigned.
Don't say a wife's partnership is not
important.
Whatever he ever taught is in question.
Now, if you know the truth,
because if it's true what Anna said that
he had abandoned their relationship,
she was probably right and he should
have probably given up that ministry
for their marriage. Now, you may love
the man. I used to. Now, I'm kind of
questioning, was he that good of a man
or what?
During the temperance movement, any of
y'all remember that?
&gt;&gt; No. Because you weren't alive yet.
During the temperance movement, uh,
preachers, you know, preached on
temperance. And for those of you who
don't know what that is, that's when
they made it illegal to sell alcohol in
America, right? Remember prohibition?
You heard of that?
So, the preacher was preaching on
temperance in his sermon, and he's
beginning to wind down. you know, he
gotten really frothed up, sweaty, but
he's starting to wind down. And so he
said this, "If I had all the beer in the
world, I would take it and throw it in
the river." And the congregation
shouted, "Amen."
Then he said, "If I had all the wine in
the world, I'd take it to the river and
I'd throw it in." And the congregation
said, "Amen."
And he said, "If I had all the whiskey
and all the rum in the world, I'd take
it and throw it in the river." And all
the congregation said, "Amen."
And then the song leader got up after
that and said, "Turn to page 126. Stand
and sing. Shall we gather at the river?"
So,
so the word uh nofalios
uh temperant in is the subject of this
lesson and it has several meanings and
basically I want you to see all four so
that you can understand all four are
what's being discussed. Now they're all
they kind of blend but it's four aspects
of the same thing. Nefalios. It appears
in the Old Testament, by the way, in the
Septuagent in a passage like in
Leviticus chap 10 and verse 9 where
after Nadab and Abahu died from strange
fire, uh they're told to never drink
wine before they go into the temple. So
many people think there's some kind of
connection between that and strong
drink, but there's no way to know for
sure. Let's look at those four meanings,
though, and you'll have my lesson
tonight. Okay. Number one. Oh, excuse
me. That's something you've already
heard. All right. Church leaders lives
must be temperate and thus they must
abnigate. Now, abnigate a word that I
think fits perfect here. It means to
renounce,
to reject,
to relinquish something that is desired
or something that you even have a right
to.
and to abstain from something you have
the right to do. Even Psalm I mean
Proverbs 31:es 4 and 5 it suggests that
people who are in important positions
should not drink
period
to abstain
l uh 1 Timothy 3:11 again it just simply
says likewise their wives and there are
four qualities in this text must be
reverent must not be slanderers we've
covered that this is to be temperate and
temperate nefallio
is from neph which basically the root is
to abstain from wine. 1 Thessalonians
5:22 says abstain from every form of
evil. That's ultimately the meaning of
this
to abdigate to literally so say I reject
it I will have nothing to do with it.
That would be a good thing for all of us
to do by the way with this subject.
That's pretty good stance to have
because you know what? You won't ever
get caught drunk driving.
It'll never happen. Never have a problem
with that. Church leaders lives must be
tempered and thus they must abnigate.
That means literally renounce, reject,
relinquish their supposed right to
drink, to literally abstain.
And so I would suggest to you that
unless that's your thinking or part of
your thinking and you're the wife of a
potential elder that maybe you
disqualify him.
Secondly,
church leaders wives must be tempered
and thus they must self-regulate.
It's also the same concept to
self-regulate in a different vein. This
idea refers to the ability to manage
one's own emotions,
one's own behaviors,
one's own thoughts. It involves
controlling your impulses
to manage your reactions
and restraining behaviors in response to
some external conditions. It is to
self-disipline. It is what we call
self-control.
So when it says likewise their wives
must be reverent, not slanderers,
temperate, the idea accordingly is to
not be drinkers
but rather literally to regulate
yourself. So even if you don't totally
abndate, you don't totally stop then it
shouldn't be a part of your life as a
regular activity.
That's the idea to self regulate.
It's from the idea of 1 Corinthians
9:25. And everyone who competes for the
prize is temperate
in all things. That means you
self-regulate yourself in everything.
Now, they do it to obtain a perishable
crown. But we an imperishable crown. And
truth be told, then is that we should
self-regulate in everything we're doing.
Not just some things, not just wine, but
everything. We ought to control our
impulses. We should not give ourselves
to do whatever we want to do, but rather
we should exercise a form of
self-control, self-regulation. And thus
you to do that, you have to control your
impulse. It's like you don't go out and
just spend all the money you got on a
credit card, right? You control your
impulses. You don't just let it go. Uh
you manage your reactions. You don't
just blow up. You manage your reactions.
You restrain your behaviors. You may
want to act out, but you don't act out.
You restrain yourself. It is to
self-regulate.
And it's definitely a part of the
meaning of this nefolios.
Thirdly,
church leaders wise must be tempered and
thus they must be moderate.
Moderate means and refers to the idea of
not being extreme. either
politically.
Some of y'all need to hear that.
Left or right?
Do you hear me?
Moderate.
Moderate socially,
moderate religiously.
Not radical right, not radical left.
moderate
to be moderate in your views, moderate
in your conduct. It tries to find the
middle ground rather than being rigid,
doing what I know it must be. It rejects
extremes in favor of a more cautious
approach.
It limits itself.
1 Timothy 3:11, "Likewise, their wives
must be reverent, not slanderous,
temperate." That means to literally
limit it. The nefalios here can be
marked by literally moderation and
limits not extreme or excessive and
without extravagance. That's the reason
Ephesians 5 and verse 8 uses this
statement. And do not be drunk with wine
wherein ex is excess
but be filled with the spirit. So even
if you haven't heard anything I've said
up until now and you think I'm taking an
extreme position up until this moment,
you need to accept this concept that an
extreme position is exactly what it's
forbidding. Don't take an extreme
position.
So think about whatever position you
hold on anything
and maybe if you're not going to
disqualify your mate, you'd have to be a
little more moderate. So maybe not so
vocal. By the way, that would probably
mean you might should even stay off of
social media and not voice your opinion
on everything because it doesn't come
across as moderate. It comes across as
extreme.
Y'all know that, right?
Right. So, maybe tap it down a little
bit. Amen. Amen. Wall. So, church
leaders wives must be temperate and thus
they must be moderate. That means not to
be extreme or excessive or rigid in
views or morals or in conduct. Final
meaning that's encompassed in this word
nefolios.
Church leaders lives must be tempered
and thus they must be sedate or sober
especially in their thinking and in
their judgment. So to be sedate or sober
in judgment is one of the major meanings
behind this word. is to be convey a
calmness, a sensibleness, a clearheaded
approach just as someone who's not
drunk.
Thinking is clear because as you know
people who are drunk are a little tipsy
don't think clear.
It's rational. It's careful and it's
responsible. It suggests a realistic
approach and an objective evaluation of
things and not irrational.
So when it says likewise their wives
must be reverent not slanderers but
temperate. This nefolios carries with
you the idea especially according to the
idea of nephew which means to be sober.
It carries with you the idea to be not
just sober but sober in judgment. So
even you're that way regardless of
drink.
Sober. Sober in your thinking. In fact,
we see that in 1 Timothy 3 and:e 2. A
bishop then must be blameless, the
husband of one wife, temperate. Right
next to it is soberminded, of good
behavior, hospitable, able to teach. So
church leaders, wives must be temperate
and thus they must be sedate to some
degree. There must be a calmness, a
sensibleness, a clearheadedness,
a rational behavior, and a responsib.
Okay, that's it. There's the whole
thing. Basically, there's a suggestion
by this word is there's maybe you should
abstain.
Just totally abnigate your right to
drink. I I just believe Bible suggests I
can. Okay, but maybe you should think
about not just deciding never to do it
or self-regulate. You're going to do it.
Control your impulse. Well, it's free
tonight.
It's an open bar.
Yeah.
Maybe not.
Or moderate. Not extreme. Not excessive.
You know, it's one thing to taste
something. It's a whole another thing to
drink down
and then sedate. More than just sober,
but the idea of sober thinking, just
always. So, temperance is a quality we
all should strive for in all of its
meanings, quite honestly. And that's
just the truth. I mean, we we should all
try to be this kind of thing.
Francis Elizabeth Caroline Willard.
Isn't that a name? I don't know what
they were thinking the mom and dad when
they named her all that. But anyway, uh
she lived back in the 1800s and she was
an educator, a a temperance reformer. So
she was a part of bringing in
prohibition. She worked really hard.
She's the national pres president of
women's Christian temperance union from
1879 till her death in 1898. And by the
way, I want you to know this because a
lot of you are not aware of our history.
Alcoholism became a real problem.
It was a bigger problem in some ways
than it is now.
And that may be hard for you to
understand. When the reformation
movement, when the revival took place in
Cane Ridge, if those of you who know
that history, the problem before that
happened was everybody in the Kentucky
region had a steel and everybody was
drunk and they're drinking like a civ.
That's not a madeup story. That's the
real history of the Cane Ridge revival
before it. It was a serious problem.
But she said, this is Francis Elizabeth
Caroline Willard. She said, "Temperence
is moderation in the things that are
good and total abstinence from the
things that are foul." H That'd be a
good thing to live by, wouldn't it?
Think that'd be a good thing to live by.
Listen, I'm not trying to be ugly here.
I know I know in a congregation this
size,
some of you drink regularly.
And I don't know who you are. I'm not
I'm not following you. I don't have some
little thing in your house. I'm not
doing that. I'm not trying to be really
ugly. I'm just simply saying I'm aware.
I'm not totally, you know, I'm not
sitting over in a corner saying, "Oh,
none of my people drink." No, that's not
true. I know better. Okay.
The AP carried a sad story about spring
break.
There was in Sto
Domingo
they had a tequila drinking competition
and at the end of it the contestants
almost all of them got sick.
The winner was Ricardo Ivon Gracia.
He drank more than 50 shots of tequila.
He won a prize of $330
and he went to the hospital and died
from alcohol poisoning. Had a heart
attack and died.
It's not a joke.
On an empty stomach, young people, you
think you can drop it. Listen, I was
around alcohol a lot when I was young. A
lot. like daily.
Okay. So, I'm suggesting to you be
careful.
It can kill you.
One guzzle of a fifth and you could fall
over dead. And you don't realize that.
And some of y'all smoking some of this
stuff, this pipe stuff now. You're going
to end up dead if you're not careful.
That stuff will kill you. I'm not even
talking about real hard drugs right now.
I'm talking about stuff we don't even
think about. I'm just trying to warn
you. It it's serious. Temperance is not
a matter of really God though demanding
us to live a joyless life. Temperance is
to guard us against health problems and
true unhappiness.
as a child because I was as a child of a
former alcoholic because my dad did
change.
My dad was an alcoholic and he became a
Christian. He gave it up.
Um,
just for those of you who hadn't lived
that life, you don't know that life,
you've never walked that path,
you haven't seen that much alcohol in
your house.
You maybe have a glass of wine every now
and then and you don't think it's a big
thing except what the influence you may
be having on somebody else in your
household and you forget about that one
because they might not be able to handle
it and you're doing fine. What if they
can't?
Your children watch that and you think,
"Oh, it's no big deal. They drink wine
in the Bible."
Maybe the Lord's agreeing with me. I
don't know what that was about. I saw
the damage of alcohol and drugs, not
secondhand. I saw it firsthand.
To this day,
I don't talk about these things much. I
have lasting PTSD.
Make no mistake. There are things I
don't like talking about. Period.
Likely some of you do too. If you would
speak,
if I could, I'd pour in you what's in
me, which is an absolute fear of it. You
see, it's I'm not afraid of it because I
afraid afraid I wouldn't like it. I'm
afraid I would like it. I think I would
like it.
I think I would want it.
And that would be the problem.
That's why I do not drink. And I would
highly recommend you leave it alone.
Abnigate completely from it. Do you have
the right to it? Some would argue yes.
I'm just simply saying I think you would
be much wiser to not.
And Proverbs 31 still suggests that
people who are in high powered
leadership should stay away from such
things. And I highly recommend it. If
you're going to be an elder or an
elers's wife,
temper it. If I could, I would get you
to stop right now and never consume
another drop. I know that's not
possible, and I'm not pushing that
really hard, even though I would push it
just a little bit right here. But more I
want to push the qualities of being
temperate in a broader and an important
way. Abstain from anything that you have
a right to but might not be good.
Control anything that might be easily
gotten out of control. Moderate your
life. Don't be extreme.
And be sober in the way you behave and
in the way you think. All Christians
must be temperant. I believe Christ was
temperate.
I really do. And I would recommend it to
you. If there's any one thing I would
say though is if I were to discover that
an elers's wife drank every day, I would
say no.
We don't need her and we don't need him.
No.
So ladies, you may think this is all
about him.
This is about us
young people. This is about us.
This is about all of us. What kind of
people we're going to be. If you're here
tonight and you haven't been thinking
about what you ought to be like and
you've never really thought a whole lot
about it. Maybe that's what you should
be doing right now. Maybe you should be
thinking about maybe I need to be more
tempered in all things, right? Maybe
just in everything. And maybe there's a
message in here for all of us tonight.
And if you need to come forward, we'll
try to help you every way we can. If you
need to repent of your sins, confess the
name of Christ, be baptized tonight, we
we would help you do that. There's sin
in your life and you've let one of these
things get away with you and you you're
a closet alcoholic.
It might be time to admit it. Come
forward and let us pray for you.
The rain's upon us. If you need to come
while we stand, while we
