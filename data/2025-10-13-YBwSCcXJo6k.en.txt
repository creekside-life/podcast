One, two. There you go. Seems to be a
slide missing. Maybe we should just go
straight to the song. Sean,
just kidding.
Morning everybody.
I love Sean.
Um, I have some really good news I I
wanted to share with you. It's probably
not as exciting for you as it is for me,
but Rex is back next week.
So, I am very excited about that. Trust
me, I appreciate the work that that man
does. That's for sure. Um,
welcome everyone.
Uh, the the last two weeks has uh the
two lessons we we went through, it
touched on some harsh evils in the
world. And not just the
the hand in the cookie jar kind of evil.
I'm talking about some horrific,
disgusting, bloodthirsty evil that most
of us are too afraid to even
acknowledge.
And um I tell you what it's we are in a
spiritual battle church.
And we should know our enemy, right?
We are in a spiritual battle. And I will
say that many many years over 10 years
of studying some of this horrific stuff,
it did take me down roads of depression.
Now let me let me clarify you. I'm not
depressed. I have a wonderful wife. I
have a wonderful son.
You know, I I I am very blessed in many
ways, but there is that depression part
of me that is
I am depressed
that humanity could fall so far from
God. I am depressed that mankind
chose
the path it did when it's so obvious
that God is so good.
I am depressed that I contribute daily
to the jar of sin. Right? That's the
depression I'm talking about. The
realization that we are plagued with
this cancer, this parasite, this evil.
So,
how do we
how do we live through that? So here I'm
just going to give you three points that
have helped me through the years just to
navigate some of the evil in the world
and help me find the good. So this is a
simple lesson and I'm hoping it just
restores some hope and some some energy
in you but uh helps you to find the
good. So we will go back to the
pessimistic book of Ecclesiastes
and I want to read from chapter 4:1
and it says then I returned and
considered all the oppression that is
done under the sun
and look the tears of the oppressed
but they have no comforter.
On the side of their oppressors there is
power
but they have no comforter. Therefore, I
praise the dead who are already dead
more than the the more than the living
who are still alive. Yet better than
both is he who have has never existed.
What a statement that is. Who has not
seen the evil work that is done under
the sun. Again, I saw that for all toil
and every skillful work a man is envied
by his neighbor.
This also is vanity and grasping for the
wind. The fool folds his hands and
consumes his own flesh.
Better a handful of quiet uh with
quietness than both hands full together
with toil and grasping for the wind.
Then I returned and saw vanity under the
sun.
There is one alone without companion. He
has neither son nor brother. Yet there
is no end to all his labors. Nor is his
eye satisfied with riches. But he never
asks, "For whom do I toil and deprive
myself of good? This also is vanity and
a grave misfortune." Pray with me.
Our dearest God, our heavenly father,
Lord, we are so humbled by you. So
grateful for the God that you are,
Father, that you created us
um and gave us life, Father.
But Father, along the way, we fell. we
uh turned turned away from you, Father.
And we've had to experience and put up
with this suffering and this evil in
this world.
And Father, we just pray that you can
help guide us to comfort. Help us to
understand the good
that we need to strive for. Father,
Father, it's a tough world and we're
called to be the light. We're called to
be the salt. And father, it's difficult
to do that when we don't uh
have a good game plan, Father. And so I
just pray that as we go through this
lesson, help us to uh find paths to
restore the good, to see the good, to
focus on the good, and to be uh hopeful
for what is to come. Father, we love you
so much in Jesus name. Amen.
So the value of friends,
I'm going to take you all the way back
to the beginning. In the uh in the
beginning, God created or he said, "Let
there be light." And he created light
and darkness. And he separated the two
and he called them day and night. And
God said, "It is good." Right? Say it
with me, church. It is good.
Day two, God says, um, he
takes this vault. That's a whole lot of
questions there. But he takes this vault
and he puts the vault in between the
waters of the below and the waters
above. Calls it the sky.
And God said it is good day three. He
gathers up the water and has the dry
land and has the the seas and he plants
grass and trees and and God says it is
good. Day four. Um, God creates the sun
and the moon and the stars for light and
for seasons and years. Lots of questions
there too. But then God says it is good.
Day five creates the sea creatures. He
creates the birds of the air and he
blesses them to multiply.
And God says it is good. Day six, God
creates the animals.
And he says it is. And on the same day
he says let us make humankind Adam
mankind in our own image.
And so he does. And God says it is.
No. No. He says it's not good
for man to be alone.
It is not good for man to be alone. Let
us make him a helper.
And so this idea
um let's go there
Adam the word uh there is humankind
mankind and so then the word sellah
where god takes from the side
we know we talk about the rib but the
side of Adam it's uh it's mentioned 41
times and it talks about the side
sometimes it talks about the half so
this idea that he takes a portion from
Adam he takes maybe half of Adam and the
idea that you have the strength of
masculinity and the tenderness of
femininity in the two. And so he creates
man and woman ish and Isha.
And so there's this desire that we have,
this attraction that we have to come
back together for that one, the image of
God, right?
And it gets deeper. So if you see uh in
man it says alf shin. So that that
middle letter y that's different to what
it says in woman, right? It says al
shenh. So those are the two letters that
are different. If you take those two
letters out, you have god. Kind of cool,
right? Uh that's that's the foundation
of the y vi that's mentioned 6,800 times
in the bible. So you've got y God,
you've got man and woman. And if you
take that letter out, this is kind of
cool. You have fire.
There are so many different ways I
wanted to discuss this, but there's the
obvious fire, right? Um I don't want to
get too involved in that one, but fire
reunites us. uh when we become sorry
when fire is reunited we become
co-creators with God and we have little
uh children right
but fire properly contained is good
it cooks food it uh provides heat it
propel propels cars and trucks and
planes it's good when it's controlled
when it's in a covenant
when it's not controlled it's
destructive
And so we have this word covenant which
is pronounced Britz kind of like British
but Brits. So covenant
and if you take that word and you put
fire in the middle of it
you have in the beginning
the very first word of the Bible.
So this idea that that the very first
word God is is in this covenantal
relationship with us and we're involved
in that and we have this helper and and
this this connection with one another
because it's important to God. And I
want to go back to Ecclesiastes chapter
9,
the value of a very good friend. Because
once God has created Eve,
he says it is very good. You were right.
It is very good. So the value of a very
good friend.
In chapter nine it says sorry in chapter
n verse 9 it says two are better than
one because they have good reward for
their labor. When a husband and wife
work together emotionally, spiritually,
and practically, they accomplish far
more than they could alone.
Their teamwork brings fruit, a home
built on love, shared goals, and mutual
support.
A good reward can mean not just material
blessing, but also joy, peace, and a
deeper sense of purpose that comes from
doing life together.
In verse 10 it says, "For if they fall,
one will lift up his companion, but woe
to him who is alone when he falls, for
he has no one to help him up."
Every couple faces hard times. Yes.
Is it just me? No, I'm joking.
We all face hard times. Discouragement,
mistakes, loss, exhaustion.
A strong marriage means that when one
spouse stumbles, the other lifts them up
with encouragement, prayer, and grace.
It is about mutual care. When one is
weak, the other is strong. Being alone
means facing struggles without that
comfort uh or accountability.
When I'm down, I expect my wife to to
drag me out of bed and drag me to
church, right? and she has the same
deal. If she's down, I will do the same
for her. And we lift each other up. In
verse 11 again, if two lie down
together, they will keep warm. But how
can one be warm alone?
This could be understood physically and
emotionally. Physical closeness brings
comfort, intimacy, and affection, while
emotional warmth comes from
companionship and love.
Marriage provides a God-designed
closeness and nurtures security,
belonging, and the warmth of being truly
known and loved.
And then in verse 12 there, though one
may be overpowered by another, two can
withstand him, and a three-fold cord is
not quickly broken.
Life brings challenges, pressures,
temptations, and spiritual battles.
Alone we are vulnerable but together we
are stronger. But the verse ends with
something deeper.
A threefold chord. This means marriage
woven with God at its center. When
husband, wife and God are united, their
bond is strong and not easily broken.
Their strength doesn't just come from
each other, but it comes from the Lord
who sustains them. My help comes from
the Lord.
Church, the value of a very good friend.
Cherish your very good friend.
Cherish your spouse.
In a moment they could be taken away
from us
through unforeseen death, complicated
divorces,
um, and in cases illnesses and like
Alzheimer's.
Cherish your loved ones.
Seek the good.
The value of a faithful friend. If
you're not married, this one's for you.
The value of a faithful friend.
A true friend shows love no matter what.
Giving heartfelt advice bringing joy to
the heart. In Proverbs 17:17, it says,
"A friend loves at all times, and a
brother is born for adversity." I love
these verses. Uh, Proverbs 27:9, "Oil
and perfume make the heart glad, and the
sweetness of a friend comes from his
earnest counsel."
A true friend rebukes when necessary.
But the correction is done in love. They
influence, then livven, they sharpen.
Proverbs 27:5-6.
Better is open rebuke than hidden love.
Faithful are the wounds of a friend.
Profuse are the kisses of an enemy. I
got to tell you, I love this. I love I
love a friend who's not afraid to tell
me the truth.
Like, ah, Keegan, you shouldn't be
wearing that, man. You're silly. Like, I
love that. That's a true friend to me.
And I try and reciprocate.
Sometimes I come across offensive, but I
want to be a good friend to you. And I I
want you to be a good friend to me to be
honest. I tell you what, when you know I
came here for a vacation and then I
don't know got married and that that
wasn't the plan but I was in America for
a while and I didn't get to go back to
Australia and finally when you know co
had finished and restrictions were
lifted Vic and I got to go back to
Australia to visit and introduce it to
my parents. It's wild. I never thought
my marriage would go that way, but
uh I walked into church and a man there
from Singapore named Paul, friend of
mine, he didn't even say hello to me. I
haven't seen the guy for years. He
doesn't even say hello to me. He just
looks me up and down and goes, "Kean,
you got fat."
And I'm like, "Yeah, dude." Right,
America. But
but I just love that. I I love the
honesty. I love a true friend that will
just tell you exactly how it is, man. I
love Paul. Uh, good man.
But, uh, he didn't even say hello.
Couldn't believe it. Anyway, Proverbs
27:17, "Iron sharpens iron, and one man
sharpens another."
A true friend avoids gossip, forgives,
is loyal, and does not hold grudges.
Proverbs 17:9, "Whoever covers an
offense seeks love, but he who repeats a
matter separates close friends." In
Proverbs 18:24, "A man of many
companions may come to ruin, but there
is a friend who sticks closer than a
brother."
We're going to read the scripture a few
times today. Two are better than one
because they have good reward for their
labor.
True friends
us. We serve God better together.
When two believers walk side by side,
they strengthen one another, share
wisdom, and work together for the
kingdom. their good reward. Our good
reward is joy and the fruit of shared
faith, encouragement, answered prayers,
growth in Christ, and the blessing of
doing life with someone who shares your
heart to God.
That's each other. Look around. I'm
talking about faithful friends,
faithful to God and faithful to you.
Verse 10, for if they fall, one will
lift up his companion. But woe to him
who is alone when he falls, for he has
no one to help him.
Even strong believers stumble sometimes
through temptation, discouragement, and
doubt. A faithful friend doesn't judge
or walk away, but reaches down to lift
his brother up.
Always sister, back up in grace and
truth. You know what I'm talking about.
There's someone in your brain that
you're thinking about that does that for
you, that lifts you up. And they don't
even know they do it sometimes, right?
Godly friends pray for one another. They
speak life into each other and remind
one another of God's promises when one
forgets.
Alone, we are more likely to stay down.
Together, we help each other back to our
feet. When we're faced with the evil and
the suffering of the world,
I turn to my friends. I turn to you. I
turn to to our fellowship that we have.
This is where I draw strength
and comfort. Church is not just a social
club.
Let me say that again. Church is not
just a social club. We treat it like
that. It's deeply rooted in meaning and
purpose divinely instituted by Jesus.
And we so often take it for granted.
I was going to pick out a few of you in
the crowd, but let me let me say this,
church. I see Jesus in every one of you.
And so when I'm down, when there's when
there's that depression of the world
that we talked about in the beginning, I
see Jesus in each and every one of you.
I don't want to mention names, but there
are people that are suffering right now
with with things I don't think I could
ever deal with.
And I see their perseverance. I see
their character. And you know who I'm
talking about.
And I see Jesus in you.
And you give me strength by your
perseverance. I see you coming to church
when I know how much you are struggling.
And I'm like, "Wow,
I see Jesus in you. I um I I see I see
people here who are so accomplished in
life and so humbled about it.
I see Jesus in you.
I see people here who work hard. We know
there's people here that work hard, that
behind the scenes do things. I see you
and I see Jesus in you. Thank you for
being that example to me. When I'm down,
I look to you and I go, that's how it
should be. I get to see Jesus. So, thank
you.
I could mention some in my youth as
well. Jesus used to speak in parables,
right?
I got one youth who when he answers
every time he speaks in parables. Where
is he? EMTT.
And he makes me realize I'm a Pharisee
because I have no idea what he's talking
about. No, I'm kidding. No, I love EMTT.
And I love seeing his passion. I am so
privileged to watch the young people and
their passion grow each and every week.
So, thank you. I see Jesus in you guys.
You steer me in the right direction. I
know I'm the one standing up here
preaching, but I'm telling you, you
steer me in the right direction. That's
the friend.
Verse 11. Again, if two lie down
together, they will keep warm. But how
can one be warm alone? Warmth here
represents comfort and closeness. The
encouragement and spiritual strength
that comes from companionship. A true
Christ centered friend brings warmth to
the soul especially in a cold or
difficult seasons
through prayer, laughter and
I guess uh funny text messages and
shared burdens.
Faithful friends keep one another's
hearts from growing cold. Isolation
chills the spirit. Fellowship keeps it
alive.
When I'm empty, I can call on one of
you. You don't even know it, but you are
actually filling up my cup. And I want
to thank you for that.
In Hebrews 10,
the writer is saying um in verse 24,
"And let us consider how we may spur one
another on towards love and good deeds,
not giving up meeting together
as some are in the habit of doing, but
encouraging one another." And all the
more as you see the day approaching the
the whole thing that's happening the the
the people are struggling
this is this is not a command you must
go to church. No this is hey you need to
be at church. You need to gather
together. You need to strengthen one
another. You need to see Jesus in one
another.
The value of a faithful friend. Right.
Verse 12. Though one may be overpowered
by another, two can withstand him, and a
three-fold cord is not quickly broken.
Life can be a battle
against discouragement, temptation, and
spiritual opposition. A godly friend
helps you stand firm when the enemy
attacks and when your strength waivers.
Together, you can withstand far more
than either could alone. But the true
power comes when God is that third
strand. When friendship is bound
together by his spirit,
two believers united in Christ, walking
in love and truth, form a bond that is
not easily broken.
Do you understand how privileged we are
to have this?
How wonderful this is?
When you feel alone out in that world,
this is what we have. This is a
wonderful, wonderful gift from God.
One of the greatest biblical examples of
friendship is David and Jonathan, son of
King Saul, Jonathan. His loyalty to his
friend David exceeded that of his own
father's ambition. So attached was David
that when Jonathan died, he wrote uh
songs about him. Their friendship was
closer than brotherhood.
Many of Paul's letters begin with and
end with tributes to his friends. Yes.
Those who ministered to him, supported
him, prayed for him, and loved him.
The value of a faithful friend.
So, I never wanted to be a preacher. I
never wanted to be a minister. But God
has a sense of humor and here I am,
right? But I would rather I joined the
military as a pilot. I would rather be
upside down, almost dying, being shot at
because I think this is such an
important job, such a such a delicate
job, right? Anyway, long story short,
God moves me into preaching and I find
myself preaching for a congregation in
Australia and slowly, I mean, I'd never
even gone to college to study.
I was just curious and and learning and
and slowly I got asked to go and do
lecture ships at other congregations and
and come down and help this congregation
and go over and I found myself at one
congregation and you get invited out for
lunches and teas and all sorts of stuff.
And the one couple takes me out for tea
and lovely old couple and they sit down
and they say to me, Keegan, and my youth
have heard this story. This is the Plato
story. Um but they sit me down. I said,
"Kegan, we're really angry with the
church." And of course, I'm like, "Oh,
no. Like, what what's happened? You
know, let me help somehow." Well, we
even wrote a letter. We're so angry.
Okay. Okay. What What's What's going on?
Well, we bought Play-Doh for the kids.
Okay. And we bought a whole bunch of
different colors for the kids. Yes. Yes.
Yes. And then what happened? Like, I'm
I'm really invested in the story. I'm
like, "What happened?"
And she says to me, she says, "Well,
we gave it to the the kids to the
playroom and the person who was supposed
to be watching the kids stepped out of
the class for a time being." And I'm
like, "Yeah, yeah." And then what
happened? And the kids mixed the colors
together.
And I'm like, "Uh, okay." And then what
happened?
And there was this blank stare like they
mixed the colors together. Now I've just
come off three years of studying
Satanism and child sacrifice and all
sorts of stuff. And I'm like Play-Doh.
So there's two points to this story. The
first one is what a wonderful
environment that we live in that
Play-Doh is our biggest problem.
Mixing colors.
But the second point to the story is
church, there is some sinister, horrific
evil out there and we need to be united.
Stop fighting over silly things.
The devil prowls around like a roaring
lion looking to devour. Growing up in
Africa, something I know about a lion is
that he waits for the weaker buck to be
separated from the herd. Don't be
separated from the herd.
Stop fighting over silly things. Make
things right with one another. This is
what we have.
Make the best of it.
And final point,
the value of your best friend.
The greatest friend anyone could
possibly have is Jesus Christ. When
things are really down,
I turn to him. He gladly calls us
friends.
He proved his commitment and affection
for us in con in a convincing way.
Right? In John 15, it says, "My command
is this: love each other as I have loved
you. Greater love has no one than this,
to lay down one's life for one's
friends." What did Jesus do? He laid
down his life. So what does that make
me? His friend. You are my friends if
you do what I command. I no longer call
you servants because a servant does not
know his master's business. Instead, I
have called you friends.
For everything that I learned from my
father, I have made known to you. You
did not choose me, but I chose you and
appointed you so that you might go and
bear fruit, fruit that will last. And so
that whatever you ask in my name, the
Father will give you. This is my
command. Love each other.
No greater friend do I have than the one
who laid down his life for me.
For you, your best friend.
Last time I promised. Verse N.
Two are better than one because they
have good reward for their labor. With
Jesus, you are never ever alone. I will
neither leave you nor forsake you.
You're never alone in your work, your
purpose, or your struggles. When you
labor with him,
trusting, obeying, and partnering in his
will, your efforts bear eternal fruit.
The good reward isn't just earthly
success. It's a spiritual growth, peace,
and the joy of serving alongside the one
who gives meaning to everything you do.
With Christ, your labor is never in
vain.
1 Corinthians 15:58, "Therefore, my dear
brothers and sisters, stand firm. Let
nothing move you. Always give yourselves
fully to the work of the Lord, because
you know that your labor of the in the
Lord is not in vain." In verse 10, for
if they fall, one will lift up his
companion. But woe to him who is alone
when he falls, for he has no one to help
him up.
We fall. We sin. We're tempted. We
There's sorrow and weakness. But when
you walk with Jesus, you have the Savior
who lifts you up in mercy and strength.
He never leaves you lying in your
failure. And through his grace,
forgiveness, and spirit, he restores and
steadies you again. Without him, you're
left to carry the full weight of your
own fall. But with him, you're raised up
by unfailing love.
the value of a of your best friend.
Satan loves to attack us, right?
Especially when we think we can do it on
our own.
You know what? I I will never ever do X,
Y, and Z. That's like that's like
calling out to Satan, hey, come check
this out. I will never never
I can guarantee you he's going to get
you.
But maybe if I'm talking to Jesus, Jesus
help me. Jesus, take control. Jesus,
help me not do
very different scenario.
You work with Jesus. You can't do this
alone.
Verse 11 again. If two lie down
together, they will keep warm. But how
can one be warm alone with Jesus? In a
cold and lonely world, Jesus is the
warmth of your soul. His
presence brings comfort, peace, and the
assurance that you are loved. To lie
down with him and rest uh is to sorry to
lie down with him is to rest in his
promises and find refuge in his care.
Without him, the heart grows cold and
empty. With him, you are filled with the
warmth of his spirit and the security of
his love. Psalm 23, he makes us lie down
in green pastures. He leads us by quiet
waters still. There is comfort and
warmth there.
And finally, verse 12.
Though one may be overpowered by
another, two can withstand him.
And three and a three-fold cord is not
quickly broken.
Life's battles can overwhelm us. But
when you walk with Jesus, you are never
fighting alone. He stands with you,
intercedes for you, and gives you
strength to overcome. The three-fold
chord can be seen as you, your faith,
and Christ.
A bond that cannot easily be broken. In
him you find unshakable security,
victory, and eternal companionship.
Church,
cherish your friends,
your very good friend,
your faithful friend, your best friend.
Cherish them.
Few weeks ago, uh Dorian Flynn, a man we
know well,
he passed away in his sleep. Didn't wake
up on a Sunday morning.
In the blink of an eye, he was gone.
Cherish the moments you have with your
loved ones.
Um a young man, a friend of mine,
uh 22, just
got hit by a drunk driver, didn't make
it home.
Cherish the good times.
Um,
I keep looking at the empty seats of
Brother Lou and Sister Billy. We don't
know what we have until we haven't got
it. Amen.
There's a young man, uh, a school boy
who had an accident down here on Lithia
just not so long ago.
Terrible story there. And, uh,
it breaks my heart. I've I've driven
down this road. I've been stuck at the
traffic light there in Adelaide
and uh during the day one time I see his
mother sitting by his his little
memorial there just sitting talking to
him and it crushes my heart man
that a mother lost her child like that.
And then a couple weeks ago we had
Danielle's wedding and we were leaving.
It was 11:00 at night and I look over
the road. I'm stuck at the traffic light
with um with Vic and I look across the
road and there's this young man's friend
just sitting talking to him at 11:00 at
night.
Cherish what we have.
Love one another. Let's not fight over
silly things, but draw strength from one
another. Lift each other up.
There is a lot of evil in the world, but
there is a lot of good, too.
There is so much good.
and it's here. Pray for your enemies.
Pray for this nation,
but bask in the glow and the glory of
God's goodness.
Cherish the blessing of his friendship
and the friends that he has blessed you
with. Church, our lives are but a vapor.
Our time is short, but soon it will be
made right. But until then,
bathe in his blessings.
Be thankful for one another.
If you need Christ, if you want his
friendship, you you desperately need his
friendship. If you need to repent, now's
the time. We can come forward as we
stand and as we
