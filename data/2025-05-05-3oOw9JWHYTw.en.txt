I invite you to open your Bibles to
Matthew
10. Matthew 10. We're going to look at a
portion of text there this
evening. And I
actually purposefully chose a scripture
for the scripture
reading that does not have anything to
do with what I want to talk about
tonight
because I want us to consider something
I'll share in a second. But first, if
you see the question on the screen, why
did my savior come to earth? What do you
think of when that question is posed to
you? What's the answer that comes into
your
mind? Maybe it's the song, you know,
maybe it it's that song that we sing
sometimes, why did my savior come to
earth? Well, because he loved me so. And
that's certainly a biblical answer from
passages like John
3:16. And or maybe you think of that
passage that Granger just read for us
just now when Jesus says in Matthew's
gospel for I came not to call the
righteous but sinners to repentance. And
so maybe that's one that comes to your
mind. And there's all there's all sorts
of answers that maybe come to our mind
with this
question. But I am
guessing that few of us if
any thought to ourselves when this
question came on the screen, oh why did
my savior come to earth? He came to
bring division to people even among
family
members. And yet that's exactly what
Jesus says he came to do in the portion
of text that we're going to read
tonight. And I want us I wanted us to
feel the shock of Jesus's words. So I
purposefully didn't have that read as
the scripture reading so that it
wouldn't be in your mind. So that we can
feel that shock compared to all the
other things that maybe we typically
think of as why did Jesus come to
earth? And so what I want to talk to you
tonight
about is this portion of of Matthew's
gospel.
It's actually the second time in
Matthew's gospel, among four or five,
now I can't remember, but there are four
or five times in Matthew's gospel where
Jesus explicitly says, "This is why I
came." And this is the second time in
Matthew's gospel where Jesus tells us
explicitly why he came. And it's a very
shocking thing that he says. Let's go
ahead and read it. Go ahead and go to
Matthew 10 and let's read this portion
of text together and then we'll move
through Jesus's words and make some
applications. Matthew 10 starting in
verse
34. Do not think that I have come to
bring
peace to the earth. I have not come to
bring peace but a
sword. For I have come to set a man
against his father, and a daughter
against her mother, and a
daughter-in-law against her
mother-in-law, and a person's enemies
will be those of his own
household. Whoever loves father or
mother more than me is not worthy of me.
And whoever loves son or daughter more
than me is not worthy of me.
And whoever does not take his cross and
follow me is not worthy of me. Whoever
finds his life will lose it. And whoever
loses his life for my sake will find
it. Jesus in this
text gives us a very shocking answer to
the question of why did he come to
earth? And let's work through this text
together. The first point Jesus makes in
verse
34 is that he did not come to bring
peace, but a
sword. That's what he came to
bring. Well, but Nathan, isn't Jesus
called the prince of
peace? Isn't Jesus all about
reconciliation? After all, isn't that
how his ministry and his his work is
described in Ephesians and 2 Corinthians
4 and texts like that? Isn't Jesus all
about reconciliation?
Yes, but he
also he did come to bring
reconciliation, but he also came to
bring a
sword. Well, what does that mean that he
came to bring a sword? Well, we can
summarize it with two subpoints up here.
This is how I would explain what it does
mean that Jesus came to bring a sword.
The first point is or the first subpoint
to explain that is he came to
reveal who is loyal and disloyal to his
reign. He came to reveal who is loyal
and disloyal to his reign.
And this separation of humanity into two
groups. And just note quickly that there
are only two groups. There's those who
are loyal and there's those who are
disloyal. There is no neutral group
where I'm neutral about Jesus. You
either kneel before the king or you
stand in defiance. Those are the only
two options for a king.
But this separation of humanity into two
groups is not a peaceful process. And
that's where the second subpoint comes
in on what it means that he came to
bring a sword. His reign will
inevitably cause conflict between
disciples and
rebels. His reign will inevitably cause
conflict between disciples and rebels.
This is what Jesus means when he says,
"I didn't come to bring peace. I came to
bring a
sword." He means that his presence on
earth and the kingdom of God that he
brings, the reign of God that he
brings, it's going to show where human
beings lie. And either you'll have human
beings who kneel in submission and who
want to work with him in his kingly
purposes or you have human beings who
will defy him and rebel against him. And
as those rebels come into contact with
disciples, there will inevitably be
conflict between
them. That is the sword that Jesus
brings to earth. the sort of conflict
that occurs as disciples proclaim the
reign of Jesus while the rebels on earth
oppose
it. But Jesus is not done shocking us
with his words.
He then tells us in the next
verse that this sword, this
conflict will affect the closest
relationships that we know of in this
life. He then shares with us in verses
35 and
36 that he came to turn family into
foes, enemies.
Just read that verse again with me. Look
it again at Matthew 10:35 and 36 and
just feel the shock of what Jesus is
saying
here. For I have
come to set a man against his father and
a daughter against her mother and a
daughter-in-law against her
mother-in-law. And a person's enemies
will be those of his own household.
This is a hard
saying. It's
shocking. And in a crowd this size, for
some of us, maybe many of us, this is
true. We felt this sword of Jesus in our
own families.
The separation of humanity into
disciples and
rebels. And the conflict inherent to
that separation will not always align
with our family relationships. Sometimes
that sword of Jesus will cut through
family
relationships. Sometimes sons and
fathers will be divided as one kneels
before Christ while the other rebelss.
Sometimes daughters and mothers may be
divided as one becomes a disciple of
Jesus while the other hardens her heart.
And like I said, there are those in this
room, I'm sure, in a crowd this
size, who have had their family
relationships
strained because of their decision to
follow
Christ. Some in this room maybe have
been disowned by their family for their
decision to follow Christ.
Others in this room have perhaps made
the painful choice to separate
themselves from their family or maybe
from some particular family member who
has chosen to pursue
sin. And some of us in this room have
then chosen to separate ourselves from
that person. Whatever the specific
circumstances, we felt the sword of
Jesus that he's talking about in this
passage.
And we should add that this sword is not
limited to just the relationships that
Jesus mentions here. This sword will
also pierce husband and
wife, best friends, boyfriend,
girlfriend.
The point Jesus is making is whatever
relationship that you deem to be so
valuable to you, it is possible that the
sword that Jesus brings will cut through
that
relationship. The sword of Jesus is that
he did not come to make sure that we
preserve our earthly relationships.
That's not his
priority. His priority is to determine
who is loyal to his kingship and who is
disloyal. And that will sometimes cut
through even family
ties. And that brings us to our next the
next shocking statement that Jesus
makes. Why must we go through this pain?
Why is this something that we have to
have our minds ready for if we're called
upon to experience this sword of Jesus?
Well, it's because of what Jesus demands
from us. He demands first place in our
hearts even above familial
bonds. Even above familial
bonds. Look again at verse 37.
Consider how hard this
is. Whoever loves father or mother more
than
me is not worthy of
me. And whoever loves son or daughter
more than
me is not worthy of me.
Jesus demands our
love above every other human
relationship. No matter how valuable it
is to
us, we must be willing. If we are to be
worthy of Jesus, we must have the
willingness in our heart to choose Jesus
over our father, over our mother, over
our son, our daughter, our best friend,
our
spouse, girlfriend, boyfriend, whatever
relationship you consider to be so
valuable to you. If you are not worthy
to sacrifice that for
Jesus, you're not worthy to be his
disciple.
And that is outrageously
difficult. But that's what he
demands. That's the extent to which we
are to prioritize Jesus over over every
other
relationship. But Jesus recognizes how
painful that is. Jesus is not saying
this with some callous demeanor as if
he's oblivious to how painful this is.
He shows that he recognizes the pain of
this with what he says in the very next
verse in verse 38. He likens this to
crucifixion. This is the cross that all
disciples must be willing to
bear. In verse
38, he says, "And whoever does not take
his cross and follow me is not worthy of
me.
Now Jesus undoubtedly said this
statement on multiple occasions in
multiple contexts and that's suggested
by the fact that this statement is in
multiple places in different gospels. In
fact in Matthew's gospel it's in two
places. It's here and it's in Matthew
16.
Now in Matthew 16, Jesus says this
statement in the context of of literal
martyrdom where Jesus is saying, "You
must be willing to be martyed for me,
die for me." However, in this
context, I do think that there's a
different angle here for what Jesus
means or at least what Matthew means
having placed this statement here in
this context as he was composing his
gospel. Since this statement in verse 38
is uttered in the context of losing
relationships, I think that what Jesus
what we're being shown is Jesus
recognizes how painful this is. He knows
what he's asking for. He knows that when
he says to you, "You must give up your
son or daughter for me. You must give up
your family member for me." He knows
that that's the same equivalent of pain
as saying, "You need to take up your
cross and be crucified for me." He knows
this is
painful. But it's a cross that all of us
who claim to be disciples of Jesus must
be willing to bear.
And I would also point out that Jesus
does not ask us to do something that he
himself did not do. Because do you
remember when Jesus is now facing the
moment in Gethsemane when he has a
choice? His choice is I can stand up for
the kingdom of heaven and be loyal to
the kingdom of heaven and face literal
martyrdom or I can give in and say, "Oh,
neighbor, no, no, hang on. Uh, no, no,
no. I take it back. I'm I I'm not Jesus.
I'm not the one you're looking for." He
had that
choice. But notice what Jesus
loses when he decides to stand and say,
"I am he. I'm the one you're looking
for.
Everyone closest to him abandons him.
He's left
alone. Jesus lives what he asks of us.
He's not asking us to do anything he
himself was not willing to do. He
experienced the pain of losing those who
had claimed loyalty to him. Those who
had professed love for him. He's
experienced the pain of having those
people say, "You're going to stand up
for the kingdom of heaven. Nuh-uh. Not
me. See you. We're
done. He's experienced that. He knows
that
pain. And
finally, Jesus then in this last verse
of this portion of text that we're
examining, Jesus makes the paradoxical
statement that helps us understand what
is at stake here.
He says in verse 39, "Those who lose
their life for
Jesus will find eternal
life." Again in verse
39, the paradox here, whoever finds his
life will lose
it, and whoever loses his life for my
sake will find
it. Now, my point on the screen focuses
on the last half of that statement.
Let's first though address the first
half of that statement when Jesus says,
"Whoever finds his life will lose it."
Since this is said also in the context
of losing relationships, that's where
I'm going to focus. I'm going to focus
on that angle here for what Jesus
means. The paradox here
is if we
decide that our our earthly
relationships are more important to us
than Christ. I don't want to lose that
family member. I don't want to lose that
relationship with my son or daughter or
spouse, boyfriend, girlfriend, best
friend. I don't want to lose that.
That's going to feel like gaining
life because after
all, doesn't it feel more lifegiving to
maintain those relationships that are so
much that are so important to
you? But the paradox is if we make that
decision and say this is more important
to me than Christ, it may feel like we
are finding our life, but the reality is
we are setting oursel up to lose
everything.
And this is contrasted with the second
half of verse 39, which is what my point
focuses on here. Those who lose their
life for
Jesus or those whoever loses his life
for my sake will find it.
In other words, when we make the
decision to cut off that family member
or when we experience the pain of being
disowned by that family or that family
member or that person that we loved who
says, "I just can't be in this
relationship with you if you're going to
follow Christ and be a
Christian." That's going to feel like
death.
That's going to feel like we're losing
our
life. But Jesus says to us, the reality
is you will gain life from that
decision because what you are losing is
temporary. What you are gaining is
eternal. And Jesus also lives this out.
in his own life. Because we mentioned
before, Jesus loses his disciples. They
abandoned him in his moment of crisis
when he needed them the most for his
loyalty to the kingdom of
heaven. But what did Jesus gain from
standing up for the kingdom of heaven?
He may have lost those disciples in the
moment, but he gained an eternal family
of
God. that most of those disciples then
became a part of the exception being
Judas. And the same will be true for us.
If we experience the sword of Jesus and
we lose relationships that are dear to
us because of our disciplehip, yes, it
will feel like death in the moment, but
the reality is we will gain an eternal
family that will be ours. and we will
gain the eternal life that Jesus speaks
about here in verse
39. So let's close our ex Jesus
here with just a summary of what we have
seen. Why did Jesus come to earth
according to Matthew 10 34-39? Well, we
could summarize it this way. Jesus came
to earth to cause
division even within families as a means
to reveal who is wholly devoted to
him. That's Jesus's point in this
text. To be clear, I'm not suggesting
this is the only reason Jesus came.
Again, Matthew gives us four or five
times where Jesus says, "This is why
I've come." But in this
text, this is the the answer Jesus
gives.
And this then needs to be a part of our
conception of why Jesus came to earth
and what it means for us as
disciples. Well, let me close with some
applications. What are some applications
from this text? What Jesus is
saying? The first application helps us
to just see how we need to conceive of
Jesus's arrival on earth and what his
ministry means.
My first application is this. Jesus's
arrival is a declaration of
war. Jesus's arrival is a declaration of
war. This may not be how we typically
think of Jesus's
ministry, but I would argue based on
this text, this needs to be added to our
conception of Jesus's ministry. And we
would do well to meditate on this this
reality. The creation God has
made has been usurped by Satan and sin
and the forces in rebellion against God.
And so by sending Jesus into creation to
bring with him the kingship of God to
reclaim his creation that he
made that will
inevitably cause
conflict. God is necessarily declaring
war on the forces that work against his
creation and kingly purposes.
In other words, the reign of God that
Jesus brings did not break into a
neutral world. It has broken into a
hostile one. And so because of that,
because Jesus's arrival is therefore a
declaration of war, we should expect
casualties. And some of those casualties
will be the
relationships that are dear to us.
Now, I do want to be clear about what I
am not
saying. I am not saying with this point,
nor does even Jesus ever address this
specifically. I'm not saying that
there's always one way to handle a
situation where we maybe are dealing
with a family member who has chosen to
pursue sin or we've been disowned by a
family member. how we interact with
those close to us who are in rebellion
to Jesus. That's going to differ from
situation to situation. Like I said
earlier, some of us in this uh room may
have made the decision to cut ourselves
off from somebody in our family who's
chosen to pursue sin. Others of us
though, we may have a family member
who's chosen to pursue sin, but we're
still in relationship with them because
we're trying to win them back to Christ
through that relationship. So again,
circumstances will be different, but the
overall point Jesus is
making is that all of us need to be
willing to sacrifice those relationships
for his sake.
And even if some of us have chosen in
our circumstances to maintain a
relationship with a sinful person who's
close to us, you still feel the sword of
Jesus that he's talking about because
that relationship is not what it would
be if that person chose to be a disciple
and now you're walking together in
loyalty to him. You still feel the sword
of Jesus in that relationship.
And so again, how each of us deals with
these different circumstances will be
different from case to case. So I just
want to be clear. I'm not suggesting
that all of us necessarily have to
always make the decision, oh that
person's sinning. They're cut off from
me. We might decide to do that. We might
not. But the relationship should be
changed. We shouldn't treat them as if
everything's okay and that, hey, you're
just as much a brother to me as as my
Christian brothers are. We shouldn't be
acting that way because that's just
false. If they're rebels to
Christ, that should affect the
relationship in some fashion. And we
need to be willing to give up that
relationship to whatever extent we
decide to do so for the sake of Christ.
A second application I would submit to
you is one that I think is extremely
important and I speak from personal
experience with
this. Relational
separation can be a work of
Christ just as much as relational
reconciliation. Relational
separation can be just as much a work of
Christ as relational reconciliation.
This is something that I would argue we
need to
internalize, especially those of you and
those of us who are in positions of
being mediators or or in authority
leadership positions.
This must be
internalized because if you're like
me, or I should say if you're like me
before I went through what I experienced
with a family member, then when you
witness a rift in the relationship,
what's your first
instinct? I got to reconcile. I got to
step in and reconcile these two these
two people here. And that's not wrong.
It's not wrong to have that
instinct. But we need to also recognize
what Jesus says in Matthew
10:34-39. Sometimes riffs in
relationship are because of
him. And so we can't then rush into a
situation and think what the Lord wants
in this is for these two people to
reconcile.
Maybe, maybe not.
We need to first understand what caused
the breach in the
relationship because if that
relationship or excuse me if that rift
in the relationship has been caused by
one person standing up for righteousness
and the other person rebelling against
righteousness then what's needed there
is not reconciliation at least not first
what's needed first is repentance that's
the priority and if that person who is
saying no I'm following Christ in this
matter, there can't be then any
reconciliation. That's the sword of
Christ that has cut through that
relationship. And that's as much his
work as reconciliation when that
occurs. And that's something that we
need to keep in
mind as we're working with others who
maybe have riffs in the relationship.
Relational riffs are always
unfortunate, but they are not always
inherently
ungodly. And we need to internalize the
fact that Christ himself said, "I have
come to bring a sword. I have come to
turn family members against each other."
And so therefore when we have
separations there are times when that
separation is
godly and it is what Christ him is a
work of
Christ. And then finally one last
application.
This last
application is in the form of a
question. It's the question that I think
this text forces all of us to
confront. Are you willing to prioritize
Christ over the relationships that mean
the most to you?
Are you willing to carry this
cross? It's very easy to discuss these
things theoretically
here and to say, "Oh, yeah. In theory,
uh, sure, yeah, I'd be happy to," or not
happy, but I'd be willing to sacrifice
this family member for Christ. Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
But when you face that in
reality and your son or your daughter
says, "No, I'm not following Christ." Or
your parent says to you, "No, I'm not
following Christ. I'm not repenting for
that." Or your best friend says, "No,"
and mocks Christ
openly. When you're faced with that
situation, this question becomes much
more
weighty. Are you willing to sacrifice
that
relationship for Christ for your
disciplehip to
him? At my last
church, well, it was brother Shane, our
brother Shane Scott who preached to Val
Rico, passed away recently. He shared a
story one time with a young man he was
studying with. And this young man was a
Muslim. And this young man came to
believe in Jesus as the Messiah. And he
was baptized into Christ join and joined
Christ's family. And when his Muslim
family discovered what he had done, they
completely disowned him.
That
disciple lived what Jesus is talking
about here. That young
man, it was a sad and unfortunate
situation. Maybe you've had to endure
something similar in your own
disciplehip. And I will say this, I
don't have this up here as an
application, but I thought of it before
tonight's lesson. If you are currently
struggling with this cross, if you
yourself are in a situation where you
have strained relationships because
people close to you, family members,
best friends, whatever, if they have not
knelt in submission to Christ and
there's that strain or maybe it's been
completely
severed, pray for
them. Continue to pray for them.
continue to model Christ to
them. Show them love when you have the
opportunity because you never know what
may eventually pierce their heart and
get them to see, you know what, maybe
there's something to this.
Why did my savior come to
earth? Well, according to this text, he
came to bring a
sword. He came to turn family into
foes. And this is because, as I said
earlier, there is no neutral position to
Jesus. There's either submission to his
kingship or rebellion. And those are the
only two options that human beings have.
But if we are willing to lose everything
for him, our relationships, even our
lives, his promise to us is you will
gain an eternal life far better than
anything you can
imagine. Is Jesus your priority?
If he
isn't, then I would just ask
you, what do those other things have to
offer to you that are better than what
Christ
offers? What's keeping you from making
the decision? Yes, I want to be unified
with
Christ. I want to share in his glory in
his resurrection, even if it means I
have to first go through the cross to
get there.
What do those other relationships have
to offer to you? What do those other
things have to offer that are better
than what Jesus is
offering? If he is not your
priority, make him your priority
tonight by faith and baptism or perhaps
by recommitting to him publicly through
confession.
You can do either one tonight with one
of the elders at the front up here while
we stand and sing the invitation
