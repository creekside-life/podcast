Right. Last week was an inconvenient
truth. This week it's an obvious truth.
Jesus is king. Amen. Say it with me,
church. Jesus is king. Proclaim it.
Jesus is king. Come on, church. Shout it
with me. Jesus is king.
&gt;&gt; Amen.
Why do we forget this? Why aren't we
speaking this over and over again? Jesus
is king.
Church, think about the wise men. Think
about the magi. Right? There's one
truth, unassalable truth here that
behind each earthly throne, behind each
empire, Jesus is king.
This is not a mere title, but it's a
central reality in history. It's the
heartbeat of scripture. It's the promise
of eternity that Jesus is king.
Consider the journey of the wise men
from the east. What we've just read,
thank you, David, whose arrival in
Bethlehem shattered the illusion of
human power
and uh and heralds in this this new
divine rule.
The wise men
were no ordinary pilgrims.
They were high-ranking noblemen,
astrologers, and royal counselors from
the Paththean Empire, modernday Iran or
Iraq, serving under, get this, serving
under Shahan, Shaan Sha, the king of
kings,
like the ruthless guy's name is Frees
IVth.
His throne was stained with the blood of
his own family. This is an often this
often happens with these these uh kings
that they kill their own family to keep
their throne.
Yet these wise men, they abandon their
allegiance, right? They they transverse
over treacherous uh lands with all these
gifts for this for royalty.
Their presence,
what we've just read, defied the status
quo,
signaling that the king had been born.
Their arrival send shock waves through
Herod the Great's court. Herod the
Great. I always laugh at that one. Herod
the Great's court in Jerusalem.
Uh Herod, whose name ironically means
heroic and exalted,
was a Roman puppet king filled with
paranoia.
He himself slaughtered his family to
keep his kingdom. And now he's on a
mission to kill the infant child, Jesus.
But not today, Satan. God wouldn't let
him. The magi outwitted him. They guided
by a they were guided by a a star and
they found the child. And the first
thing they do, church, what's the first
thing they did?
They worshiped him. Don't tell me he's
just a prophet. Don't tell me he's just
a a teacher. They worshiped him. You
shall have no other gods before me. They
worshiped him.
That's that's the lesson. That's Jesus
is king. That's the lesson. Let's go
home. Let's stand and sing.
I'll be fired tomorrow.
Well,
of the month, right, guys?
first uh meeting. Jesus is king and they
worshiped him.
I love that. It's just so simple. The
very first thing they did when he was
born is they worshiped him and then
warned by God in a dream, they slipped
away without betraying his location.
They ghosted Herod. I love that. And
exposed his frailty and declared their
loyalty to the one whose kingdom no
earthly power could rival.
Just like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo
stand up and say, "We're not going to
worship these idols. We worship God,
right? So did these wise men." And and
and think about it.
These guys were were high-ranking
noblemen, astrologers, world counselors
to to these empires,
to men who would kill their family for
their throne. What do you think they're
going to do to you?
Clearly they knew Jesus was king.
And then they bring the three gifts. Mr.
um a bit a bitter resin for embalming
the dead. Foreshadowing his sacrificial
death, the mortal king who would conquer
death itself. They bring uh
frankincense, sacred incense rising like
prayer to heaven, symbolizing his
divinity and priesthood, the great high
priest who intercedes for us. And then
they brought gold. Why would you bring
gold, church?
King,
his kingship, the medal of monarchs,
affirming Jesus as the eternal king of
kings.
When last did you go to a baby shower
that had these kinds of gifts, right?
We get sweaters and diapers and I'm
like, step it up, buddy. Come on. Right.
Myrr, frankincense, gold. He is king.
From the cradle, the wise men's worship
rings out that Christ is king.
Not a distant ruler, but the sovereign
over all creation. The truth isn't
confined to Bethlehem. It echoes through
history, revealing patterns of blessings
for nations that bow to him and warnings
of those who turn away.
Here's the blessing king.
When people or a nation enthrone God as
their king through repentance and
obedience, blessings flow like rivers of
living water. This isn't blind
prosperity. This is a covenantal favor,
right, of peace, provision, protection,
and purpose. The Old Testament frames
Israel's story around this principle.
You obey and you thrive, or you rebel
and wither.
But God's mercy extends beyond Israel,
inviting all nations to the feast.
The scripture 2 Chronicles 7:14 says,
"If my people who are called by my name
will humble themselves and pray and seek
my face and turn from their wicked ways,
then I will hear from heaven and I will
forgive their sin and heal their land."
I think this really summarizes the
journey the Israelites went through.
They were good and then they were bad
and God rescues them and they're good
again and then they're bad and God has
to come rescue them and they're good and
they get blessed and then they go bad.
This constant
human behavior.
Why don't we learn from our mistakes?
But I love that. I'll read it again. If
my people who are called by my name will
humble themselves and pray and seek my
face and turn from their wicked ways,
then I will hear from heaven
and will forgive their sin and heal
their land. Our God is faithful.
Couple of examples that I I there's a
lot of examples in the Bible about this,
but King Hezekiah's revival, 2 Kings
18:20, you can see it up there. Um
Hezekiah cleans the temple. It's the
first thing he did. Cleanses the temple
or gets rid of all the the nonsense that
was going on. He restores worship and
and the Bible says the Lord was with him
and he prospered.
They were blessed. Why? Because the king
made sure the king was in his rightful
place, right? Acknowledged him
and he's blessed. And when facing
Assyria's iron fist, Hezekiah cries out
to God. And in one night, the angel
struck down 185,000 of his enemy of the
enemy soldiers. Jerusalem stood a
miracle of deliverance for a nation
realigned under the king.
the other king, King Josiah's reforms,
uh once discovering the last book of the
law
and and and hearing it tears his
clothes. He's he's outraged that how
they've been living. Josiah tore down
idols, Bal and Asher. Here we go again.
He rebuilt the temple and led a national
covenant renewal. God spared Judah from
immediate judgment, granting decades of
stability.
We see this pattern over and over again.
If you acknowledge God, if you
acknowledge him as your king, you will
be blessed.
Nineveh, the old gentile nation, pagan
Nineveh, a brutal empire,
tasted disgrace.
Jonah's grim warning sparked citywide
repentance from the king to sacloth to
the lowliest citizen.
They fasted and turned from evil. God
relented in in uh verse uh chapter 3 10
it says and he did not do it because God
relented because they turned back to him
they were blessed.
In the New Testament, this expands. The
church becomes God's holy nation. 1
Peter chapter 2:9, where faith
in Christ grafts grafts us in all people
into Abraham's blessing. Galatians 3:8,
Galatian uh Genesis 22:18, there are no
borders that bind his kingdom. It's for
every tribe and tongue. It says, "There
is neither Jew nor Greek, neither slave
nor free,
neither male nor female, for you are all
one in Christ Jesus. And if you are
Christ, then you are Abraham's
offspring, hes according to his
promise."
This echoes throughout history.
Nations that honor Christ as king
through their laws rooted in his truth.
revivals that stir the soul and leaders
who seek his face
often reap societal flourishing.
And don't we all want that?
Obedience births virtue
and virtue sustains freedom.
I love that obedience.
It births virtue and virtue sustains our
freedom.
You ever had a breakup before? We've all
had breakups.
All uh maybe written a note, a letter to
a a loved one or an ex.
We've all done that to the youth. When
when I say letter, it's a piece of paper
and you write on it and you're like,
"Dear John, it's you don't do this,
right? We've all had a breakup."
The greatest breakup letter I think
that's ever written and it stands for
America.
Uh, dear King George III,
it's definitely not me, it's you,
right? Declaration of Independence. You
guys know what I'm talking about.
greatest breakup le breakup letter ever.
They indicted tyranny tyranny and appeal
to the creator. We hold these truths to
be self-evident
that all men are created equal with
unalienable rights, life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness. I love this.
They charged George with They charged
King George with manipulation,
injustice, foreign jurisdiction,
um unjust taxes, and waging war, and
many other things.
Sounds pretty close to home right now.
Abuses that echoed Pharaoh's oppression.
And man, it it feels
feels like we might be there.
And yet they built on biblical bedrock.
I love what uh Benjamin Franklin said.
He says, "Only a virtuous people are
capable of freedom. As nations become
corrupt and vicious, they have more need
of masters."
And then John Adams says, "Our
Constitution was made only for a moral
and religious people. It is wholly
inadequate to the government of any
other.
The original 13 colonies mandated
religious oaths for office.
I reject the notion that this nation
wasn't built on Christian values.
If you go do some research, man, it is
filled with Christianity.
And it's it's obvious. America has
soared.
America has done well.
We have been blessed. I can I say we now
because my citizenship test is in
November. So, I'm almost there.
I'm going to say we. We've been blessed.
This nation has been blessed
because we put out the filth and we
turned back to God.
And Philadelphia birthed global missions
that spread the gospel like wildfire.
Um, if I look at this pattern
recognition, it screams blessing. From
the great awakenings to to post World
War II prosperity, America soared.
Church membership topped 70% through the
70s. Christian affiliation hovered
around 90 plus%
um in the 1950s.
Innovation, influence, and abundance
flowed. a healthy portion from the king
we implicitly crown.
But the higher we climb,
it seems the more exposed we are. I know
it says the harder we fall, but it seems
the more exposed we are. And it draws
flers and enemies.
The last 70 years has marked a steady
drift. crippling costs in taxes,
crumbling education, rampant addictions,
family breakdown, and the tragic
celebration of child mutilation.
Religious unaffiliates uh known as the
nuns exploded from not nuns as in
Catholic nuns, I mean nuns
exploded from 5% in 1972 to 29% in 2025.
Church affiliation has plummeted to 64%.
Scholars pinpoint the 1960s as the
fracture con uh counterculture shattered
the Christian consensus birthing
pluralism and legal shifts that sideline
faith. Key turning points I'll just read
a few of these but there's a lot. Since
1945, we had the 1950s, the rise of
consumerism, the Playboy culture,
it's in the heading, right? Shifted
focus from wartime sacrifice and
faithbased community to materialize
abundance and individualism.
Hugh Hefner's Playboy, we all know that
name, normalized sexual liberation,
eroding traditional family values.
Church attendance peaked, but was often
superficial.
Divorce rates doubled
which set stage for the 1960s unrest by
decades end. Youth alienation
you see the pattern forming contributed
to rising crime and social
fragmentation.
In the 1960s we had the sexual
revolution and counterculture. Uh this
enabled widespread premarital sex uh
fractured families and STD race
exploded. Hm. The 1962-63 Supreme Court
rulings uh Engel versus Vital
uh where the government officials were
were not sorry may not draft or
encourage prayer in public schools even
if the prayer is non-denominational and
voluntary which extended to Bible
readings in Arlington school and Schmeep
in ' 63.
In 1973 Row versus Wade redefined life
unraveling sanctity of life ethics
ethics. the 1990s, the 2010s, the tech
boom, social media, church scandals,
this all amplified division, cultural
wars intensified.
Post 911, I'm going somewhere with this
church. It sounds kind of gloomy. Post
911 to now, wars, crashes, all this
polarization that's happening. in 2015,
uh, the legalization of same-sex
marriage.
It honestly doesn't feel like we are
blessed right now. Do you hear me? It
honestly doesn't feel like we are
blessed right now. When I look at the
history of America and I look at what's
happening now,
what's changed?
It's like we've participated less in the
king's court and the fruit is bitter.
All tyranny needs a foot all tyranny
needs to gain a foothold is for people
of good conscience to remain silent.
I know this is a hard teaching. I know
this might offend some, but I'm not here
to tickle the ears of of the people. I
would love to get up and say something
nice, but this is the truth.
Is Jesus still our king?
Judges 3:7, Israel does evil in the
sight of the Lord, right? They forgot
their Lord, their God, and serve the
balls in Asher. Here they go again. This
is a constant pattern. God's anger turns
from them. Sorry. God's turn God's anger
turns them over to the Kush Rethame,
their enemies.
But after a while of oppression, they
cry out to God again, please help us.
And he res God is faithful. He rescues
them and restores them again.
And they go through this pattern over
and over again. And I'm wondering
if I look at this pattern
if God's judgment has allowed the enemy
to infiltrate the US
when we seem to be on a steady decline.
I wonder and hopefully and maybe and I
wish
that we will turn back to God as soon as
we can and be blessed and claim Jesus as
our king.
as a nation.
Hang on, before I tell you that, let's
go through this.
I'm curiously looking at Poland right
now. 2016, there seems to be something
happening. The GDP before 2016 was uh
3%. It's now up to 4.1% after 2016. It's
outpacing the European Union.
unemployment plunged.
What was that at 8.3% before 2016 and
now it's averaging 3% their lowest ever.
Poland
and their global peace index peaked even
amid Ukraine and Russia's shenanigans.
It's close to the war there. But
something's different. 2016 was a change
for them. Do you know what happened in
2016? One of the coolest things I've
ever seen here. November 19, 2016, they
declared Jesus their king in a national
act of recommmitment.
Don't you love that?
A nation stopped, came together, and
said, "You know what? He is our king
officially."
Here's another headline.
Jesus Christ is now officially the king
of Poland.
How cool is that? I'm excited for them.
And it's things are changing. They're
they're blessed.
I love this. I put this in. I'm like,
who is king of Poland? Even AI is like
current king of Poland is Jesus Christ.
I love that.
Repentance reaps reward. Church,
maybe it's time for another breakup
letter.
Not to an earthly tyrant, but to our
idols of self, secularism, and silence.
The church is being too quiet.
We need to turn to Jesus as our king.
Like multiple scriptures in Deuteronomy
command us, purge evil from your midst.
It starts with us, church. It starts
with us.
The king left something here on earth.
It's called his church.
We are part of that. We are his church.
Do we sit idly by while our nation does
horrific things?
Or do we stand up and say, "No, no, no,
no. Jesus is our king. Let's turn our
focus back to him. Let's repent. Let's
have a revival.
I'll end with this.
Well, Jesus says, "Come to me and I
shall give you rest." It was uh when I
was in Australia and I was preaching, it
it's
it's a spiritual desert down there. I
mean, you drive down streets of
churches, beautiful churches and they're
empty.
Beautiful empty churches.
Australia has strayed. South Africa as
well. I mean, I I grew up in South
Africa. It was a it was a Christian
loving nation and it has strayed.
But I tell you what, when I was in
Australia and I was preaching and it's a
very small congregation. There's like
maybe 10 or 11 people and there was a
lot of older people. A lot of people
would just fall asleep, right? And
you're preaching and like, "Okay,
everyone's sleeping. Okay, whatever."
And I spoke to Rex about and he says,
Jesus says, "Come to me and I'll give
you rest." Right?
And uh
he's not wrong,
but it's it's really true because we
come here for rest. We come here to be
with people who are like-minded. We come
here for the peace. We come here to be
re-energized. And then we get back out
into the world because we're salt and
light, right? We draw out that goodness
of the world. That's our job. That's our
duty. And we're a light on the hill for
people to find the way. We are We should
be like John the Baptist, pointing the
way. Hey guys, this is the way. This is
Jesus. He's the king. Let's go.
Come and have rest. come to church,
re-energize, and get back out in there
and
I don't want to say fight,
but live for the Lord. Proclaim his
name. Don't be ashamed.
So, this is the obvious truth that Jesus
is the king. Um, there is power in
proclaiming Jesus your king. There is
blessing in it.
You may know him as the savior, the one
who redeems your soul. But is he your
king, the one you obey first?
1st Samuel chapter 23, David and Saul.
Saul's the enemy at this point to David.
And and David is hiding and the people
of Kela, they are being attacked by the
Philistines and they need help from
their hero, David. David, please come
save us. But if David goes down to save
them, he's going to expose himself to
Saul.
So either he stays hidden
and lets his people die or he comes out
and he fights and then he's exposed and
maybe he dies because Saul will then
find him. He has got two options. Or so
it seems.
The third option that no one ever
considers is stop and go to the king.
And David stops. He bends a knee and
says, "Lord, what do you want me to do?
You're my king. Tell me."
Is Jesus our king? Is he the one we go
to first?
Jesus is the redeeming king who turns
ashes to beauty. The reigning king whose
authority crushes
uh chaos.
His kingdom is universal. It's physical.
It's ethical and it's eternal.
Revelation 19:16 declares, "On his robe
and on his thigh, he has a name written,
King of Kings and Lord of Lords."
In Romans 14:11 echoes Philippian
Philippians 2:10, "Every knee shall bow
and every tongue confess that Jesus
Christ is Lord." There is coming a day
where every knee will bow. I am excited
to to get on my knees that day. You will
I will not be holding back. I'll be
diving on my knees. He is king.
I am unashamed of the gospel, church. We
should be unashamed of the gospel. Let
me put it this way. The king, the king
stepped down off his throne.
off his throne
and bled and died and bought us back.
Not with gold, not with silver,
but with his life.
Why are we ashamed of that?
That's my king.
What other king in history has done that
for people? That's my king. I'm
unashamed of the gospel. Jesus is my
king. America may stumble. Nations may
rage, but his throne endures.
Acknowledge your king individually,
nationally. Repent, seek his face, and
watch him heal our land. I believe
America will be restored. I do. I
believe in the spirit of America.
It started off putting Jesus first. I
believe in this nation. We will be
restored. But it starts with us.
Let every heart proclaim it.
Church, take comfort.
Nothing can stop what is coming, the
King's return.
If you need Christ, if you need to
repent,
come forward today as we stand and as we
sing.
