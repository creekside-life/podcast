well there was a lot of work
done they literally uh
scientists and Engineers came together
and they discovered that the price of a
soul is somewhere between 20,000 and
$26,000 it's a little
thing but it's a beginning at least we
now
know actually a soul is
priceless what you possess your body
is a
container but your soul is priceless
we're asking the question what is the
Soul's cost to attend every
event all the services I want to talk to
you about what's written by our Brethren
and and U see what you think about this
Bobby Ross Jr is editor- and chief at
the Christian Chronicle some of you know
what that is he wrote a article on
waning Sunday night attendance churches
looking for
change he quotes Chris McClure or
McCurley excuse me from Walnut Street
Church of Christ congregation about 750
on a Sunday morning in Dixon Tennessee
here's what he said a brother we're
looking at new ways to grow our people
and reach the community in many places
our Sunday night worship Gatherings have
woefully waned in attendance while the
message cannot change we should always
be willing to adapt and adjust the
method within reason and within the
bounds of what is scriptural of course
and with the ultimate goal of drawing
people closer to God and to one
another I don't think what he said is
entirely
true John Mark Hicks also a
brother retired Professor from lipom
University in Nashville Tennessee said
this in that
article multiple meetings on Sunday were
common from the beginning including some
of the evening for prayer and bible
study revivalism in the late 19th
century and the rise of better lighting
encourage Sunday evening Gatherings for
Evangelistic preacher Ing and then shift
work during World War I and World War II
encouraged Sunday evenings for those who
missed this became standard in the
1940s I don't believe that's the whole
story but we'll look at that next week
Kevin
ber uh from the East Baltimore Church of
Christ Congregation of 225 in Maryland
said
this we did have an evening service with
an attend attendance of
35 prior to the covid pandemic but it
was fading out before
covid Patrick Odum Northwest Church of
Christ in Chicago Congregation of about
150 said we had a Sunday night service
attended by just a few until
covid after covid restrictions were
lifted we have not resumed Sunday nights
Tracy Moore from Vero Beach Church of
Christ here in Florida that's not far
away you can almost throw a rock and hit
it said this we used to have Sunday
night services now we will do a few
weeks on a sermon series or special
activities like a meal a special singing
Etc it isn't every week but only times
we believe it would be
beneficial we would believe it's
beneficial
and
Co really Co decided whether or not we
would attend Sunday
night Dr W Robert Godfrey I think is way
you say it he a president and professor
emirus at of church history at
Westminster Seminary in California I
agree with what he said more than all of
what my brethren just
said he said when people ask should we
have two services on the Lord's day my
inclination is to say that I think we
are a people of God we ought to rise up
in righteous revolt against the par
parsimony of our preachers and ask why
can't we have
three the day Belongs to the
Lord Revelation
1:10 I was in the spirit on the Lord's
day we'll revisit that quote but not
today the Soul's challenge of attending
all services what is the Soul's cost
well somebody
says I'm too
busy I can't give that much time to it
Mark 8:33 says what will it profit a man
if he gains the whole world and loses
his own
soul what would you give in
exchange Matthew 4: 8-10 says the devil
took him that is Jesus up onto an
exceeding high
mountain and showed him all the kingdoms
of the world and he said to him all
these things I will give you if you'll
fall down and worship
me and Jesus said to him away with you
Satan for it is written you shall
Worship the Lord your God and and him
Only You Shall
Serve if it's for making money how much
would be
enough how much would it been
enough well I'm too weary you don't
understand I have a long
week Ecclesiastes 12:12 and people
sitting here they're weary right
now much study is weariness to the flesh
I know sitting through a sermon
especially one to midnight can wear you
out fellow fell out the window up there
you remember that he's pretty weary
wasn't he notice though he didn't stay
home he still fell out the
window Malachi 1:3 you also say oh what
a weariness it is and you sneer at
it in Galatians 6 and ver9 let us not
grow weary while doing good I believe is
scripture let me say something about
this
weariness weariness is an attitude not a
state a
body let me prove it you can have a
million dollars if you come to church
tonight if I could do it would you be
here you better bet your last penny
you'd be
here so it's not a state of body it's a
state of
attitude well it's too frequent you're
asking too much
Luke 9:23 if anyone desires to come
after me let him deny himself and take
up his cross daily and follow me so how
often do you follow the
lord Acts 2 verse 46 says continuing
daily with one
Accord thinking Sunday school still this
same
day it's too much to ask Philippians 1
and verse 9
your love may abound still more and more
I thought we were supposed to gain in
love 1 Thessalonians 4:1 you should
abound more and more I thought you were
supposed to grow in your
dedication 1 Thessalonians 4:10 we urge
you Brethren that you increase more and
more I thought we were supposed to
improve not just
coasts maybe I missed
something this all seems peculiar to me
that I'm even talking about this that's
why I don't talk about it I find it odd
that it would ever be a subject that
would even need to be
covered that this needs to be a point of
discussion I don't know about you but
when we obeyed the gospel all other
schedules were put on the back
burner it was not even discussed whether
or not we would be present I don't even
understand this
concept I mean when you obeyed the
gospel I thought you
died I thought that's what happened and
I thought everything else took second
place I just thought that's what that
was about maybe I've been the one that's
wrong all these
years but there never was a discussion
in my home my dad was an alcoholic and
he changed let me tell you something we
never missed a single service we went
from down there to up there
some folks apparently don't think that's
the way it
went so the Soul's challenge of
attending all church services is the
Soul's cost what's one of the Soul's
cost
hearing it's a cost it really is a cost
look at it and I know it's a cost but
look at how many times the Bible
encourages you to do it because we don't
want
to our nature our our natural
inclination is to not listen to other
people you ever been in an argument you
don't want to hear them you're waiting
for them to stop talking so you can tell
your side you want them to hear you
don't want to hear so our tendency is I
don't really want to hear a sermon I
don't want to really hear what I'm not
doing right I don't want to hear that
why do you think the scripture so many
times says it do I have to read them you
can see them up there look at it how
much and this is not all of them he who
has ears to hear Let Him hear does it
say that once no how many times does it
say it over and over and over again and
then Hebrews today if you will hear his
voice today if you will hear his voice
do not Harden your heart today if you
will hear his voice do not Harden your
heart or in Revelation he who has ears
let him hear what the spirit says to the
churches or Revelation 13 if anyone has
an ear let him hear I think there's a
message in rep eating something that
many times what do you think you think
the Lord did that just because he's
filling in blanks or is he trying to
send a message we don't want to
hear and he knows
it why come back and hear more what you
didn't want to hear that
morning 1 Thessalonians 5:20 do not
despise prophecy you know what that
means don't don't hate
preaching you you can hate me
but don't hate
preaching somebody's got to be teaching
we've already had a half a dozen people
speaking second Timothy 4 I'll read that
one it's not up there beginning in verse
one I charge you therefore before God
and the Lord Jesus Christ who will judge
the living and the dead at his appearing
and his kingdom so whether you know you
or not he's going to judge us
all preach the word
be ready in season and out of season
that is when they like it when they
don't like it convince rebuke exhort
with all longsuffering and teaching in
other words it's hard to do that because
people don't want to hear it listen to
what he says I prove it they the folks
don't want to hear it for the time will
come when they will not endure sound
Doctrine but according to their own
desires because they have itching ears
they will Heap up for themselves
teachers they'll get their own teachers
they'll listen to their own guys they
won't listen to you guys anymore in
verse four and they will turn their ears
away from the truth and turn aside to
fables what fables we're not turning
aside to fables yeah television isn't a
fable none of those shows are fables all
of those are
true
really verse five But You Be watchful in
all things endure Affliction do the work
of an evangelist and fulfill your
ministry so the Soul's challenge of
attending all Church Services whether
it's Sunday morning Sunday school Sunday
night Wednesday night or whatever else
we deem we need to
have the Soul's cost is
hearing I can only guess that some don't
want to
hear number two the Soul's challenge of
attending all church services is the
Soul's cost of worshiping
Matthew 15: 89 says these draw near to
me with their mouth and honor me with
their
lips but their heart is far from
me and in
vain they worship
me John 4: 21- 24 it says the hour is
coming when you will neither on this
mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the
father you worship what you do not
know we know what we worship for
salvation is of the Jews but the hour is
coming and now is when the true
worshippers will worship the father in
spirit and Truth for the father is
seeking such to worship him this is
something he wants I know you think it's
something we
want this is something he wants
God is spirit and those who worship Him
must worship Him in spirit and the truth
God wants your
heart he wants your
worship 1 Corinthians chap 14:25 it says
this the secrets of his heart are
revealed and so falling down on his face
he will worship God I find it
fascinating that
Arabs and Catholics
kneel and we
don't Philippians
3:3 We Are Who worship God in spirit and
rejoice in Christ
Jesus our spirit supposed to be in this
Matthew 2:2 we have seen his star in the
east and have come to worship him so
want to talk to you just a moment about
how much it costs you to
worship going to do that I want you to
think with me just mathematically for a
second to come from the East they either
came from kyber which is where I think
they probably came from but they may
have come from Persia if they came from
kyber it was 500 miles away if it was
Persia it was 1300 miles that they had
to travel because you got to go north
you can't cross the desert you go north
and then South so it's 1300 miles so 500
miles to 1300 miles they had to travel
somewhere between one to two weeks to
get there
on
camels to
worship a
baby that won't know they're even
there in Acts 8: 27 it says a man of
Ethiopia a unic of great Authority Under
candese the queen of the Ethiopians who
had charge of all of her treasury had
come to Jerusalem to worship now how far
did he
travel well itend depend on where you
measure from in Ethiopia it's at least
1,500 miles or it could have been as far
as 2500 miles now if you do that in a
chariot which by the way isn't the same
thing as riding in a car you got to
stand up most most chariots but any R
1500 2500 miles that would take you on
the average with a horse pulling that
between two to three weeks two to three
weeks to show up to worship on one
day that's right so let me compare just
a minute let me get you a little
comparison in your head of what it cost
you to go to worship and what it cost
them in the old test not those two
that's that's enough I just gave those
two as an example let's just talk about
their standard worship we'll go to
Leviticus chapter 23 Leviticus chapter
23 you read the whole chapter it tells
you pretty much all they had to go to
right if you're going to do it right you
had to do all those things we're not
going to talk about every every trip
that everybody had make but let's say
that they worshiped 50 two times and it
took 12 hours that's
624 hours that they gave that because
it's the whole day they give the all day
long to Sabbath worship I'm not talking
about travel now I'm just talking about
worship they gave the whole Sabbath
right if you're dedicated Orthodox to
you today You observe the entire
day you do know that right you don't
just observe when you're at synagogue
the whole day is a day of worship they
don't wear shoes when they're not at
worship they putter around the house
they do no work they only pray and spend
time in worship for the whole day that's
uh
336 hours on top of that for special
events that they had and so that's
960 hours yearly so now their special
worship was 18 days that average would
cost them about 10 days in travel for us
this is what if you went to everything
we have so that's 4 hours on a Sunday
morning right if you go to everything
that's Sunday morning worship and Sunday
school you come back tonight we'll say
because of the wasted time between
that's 2 hours tonight if you come
Wednesday night we'll say the wasted
time and everything that's two hours of
your precious day that's that's eight
hours in a week but now we got to travel
I understand you got to drive and it's
going to cost you something there so
we'll say and I hour each time which is
really more than you do most of you but
at any rate times three that's 50 * 52
that's 572 hours for worship and travel
a year if you go to everything we offer
in a standard
week that's 624 572 that's 52 hours less
than they did in worship alone not their
travel if you had their travel time in
they go to 960 hours hours a year for
their worship which means they spent
388 hours more than we do with all that
we do 300 that's 7 and a half hours more
a week to worship their
lord I know Brethren who give an arm and
a leg to be able to be here and they
can't even be
here so the Soul's challenge of
attending all search Services the Soul's
cost of worshiping and I can only guess
that some simply don't want to worship
with
us number
last the Soul's challenge of attending
all church services the Soul's cost of
fellowshipping Galatians Chapter 2 and
verse 9 when James sephus that is Peter
and John perceived the grace that had
been given to me they gave me and
Barnabas the right hand of Fellowship
you realize that right right when you
make a handshake you're extending
Fellowship those of you never shake
hands you need to get over it cuz we
need your handshake
amen amen
walls Philippians 1: 3-5 I thank my God
upon every remembrance of you do you
really for your fellowship in the gospel
from the first day until now do you
really thank God for each person
here Philippians 2 verse1 if there is
any Fellowship of the spirit is there
any Fellowship of the spirit do you feel
it Philippians 2 vers1 if there is any
Fellowship of the spirit 1 Peter 1:22 in
sincere love in sincere love of the
Brethren love one another fervently with
a pure heart do you really want to be
around us or not
have you thought about it that way have
you ever thought what it's like to be
the date that the guy doesn't show up
for 1 Peter 2:1 17 love the
Brotherhood 1 John 3:14 we know that we
have passed from Death to life we know
that we're saved we have passed from
Death To Life how do we know that we've
passed from Death To Life how do you
know you're saved today
how do we know we know that we passed
from Death to life because we love the
Brethren he who does not love his
brother abides in
death 2 Corinthians 6:14 do not be
unequally yolked together with
unbelievers so you'd rather be with them
than with
us you'd rather be with
them than with us do not be unequally
yolked together with unbelievers for
what Fellowship has righteousness with
law you actually don't have fellowship
with them you may think you do you don't
we are your
fellowship that's a passing friend and
what communion has light with Darkness
so love but you love us but you don't
want to be around us
much the Soul's challenge of attending
all Services is the Soul's cost of
fellowshipping I can only guess I can
only guess that some do not want to
fellowship with
us which means you just really don't
love us the way you say you
do this is the
cost it's hard to
hear if your heart's not in it it's hard
to worship
if you don't love us it's hard to
Fellowship
us the goal is not just to slide into
Heaven by the skinny of teeth my
brother I can't is that it that's all
we're doing I made
it now look I want everybody to go to
heaven I may be stuck through the idiot
hole I don't care I want us all to go to
heaven amen amen
amen but the goal is not just to barely
make it by the skinny of teeth
right my dad would say to me when he
knew that I was going to be a preacher
this after he changed he would say to me
this is a say it may not mean anything
to you but it means a lot to me if
you're going to be a
preacher I don't want you to just be a
another 2x4 preacher he is a carpenter
how many 2x4s are in a house
don't just be one of
nothing do something
more and I've tried to listen to that
probably hadn't succeeded but Fritz
Chrysler was a famous violinist I've
talked about him before he said this
narrow is the road that leads to the
life of a
violinist hour after hour day after day
and week after week for
years I've lived with my
violin there were so many things that I
wanted to do that I had to leave
undone there were so many places I
wanted to go that I had to miss if I was
to master the violin the road that I
have traveled was a narrow road
and the way was
hard to be a
disciple that hears that worships that
fellowships at every opportunity has a
cost I know there's other sacrifices and
most of them probably more important in
many ways because if you're going to be
a Apprentice of Christ it's not just in
name only you've got to be it every day
all the time in every way never lying
never cheating never doing anything
wrong never going over the speed limit
always stopping at stop signs always
doing the right thing when someone's
ugly to you yes I know what it costs I
try to live there too I understand the
concept I know how hard it is yes yes
yes yes yes yes it's hard but what are
you called to you died and your life is
hid with Christ God when Christ who is
your life shall appear then you shall
appear with him in
glory I think it's worth the
cost Berto or
bertoo de
Giovani was the pupil of
Donatello great sculptor of his
time but beralo was the teacher of
Michelangelo who's probably the greatest
sculpture of all
time mang Angelo you may not know this
but he was 14 years old when he came to
beralo I mean he was that good already
at 14 he was that good already he was
obviously enormously gifted Balo was
wise enough to realize that gifted
people are often tempted to
Coast rather than
grow and therefore he kept trying to
pressure Michelangelo his young Prodigy
to work ser seriously in his craft and
in his art one day beralo came into the
studio where Michelangelo was toying
with a piece of sculpture far beneath
his abilities and bldo grabbed a hammer
stomped across the room and smashed it
to bits shouting the
unforgivable and
Unforgettable message to Michelangelo
Michelangelo
Talent is
cheap
dedication is
costly any believer can easily attend
Sunday mornings listen to me now those
of you who I'm going to step on your
toes for just a moment those of you come
Sunday morning
occasionally anybody can do that
once a
month twice a
month you can do that
accidentally that's not dedication my
friend I don't know what you think that
is I'm just being honest with you for a
moment can I be real honest just for a
moment if all you're doing is once a
month you've not committed to the Lord
Jesus
yet at some point you need to make a
commitment
and I really can't see this how anybody
leaves that doesn't have to go to work
or doesn't have a medical
condition it doesn't stay for Sunday
school I'm confused by that one missing
an opportunity to sit with your brothers
and sisters and ask questions to study
the Bible I'm confused by
it aren't you walls
any wall confused in here you wall over
there aren't you a little confused that
some of these people will leave here in
a mo moment it's their plan it's not
accidental it's their plan to leave it's
not because they couldn't stay they've
planned to leave they have no intention
of being here beyond that and then of
course tonight folks will be napping or
whatever have you thought it through
what you're
doing you think this is about obeying
the
elders oh next week you come next week
which you probably won't after this
lesson but if you come next week you'll
find out that's belonging has nothing to
do with the eldership why we come Sunday
night nothing zero I don't come to obey
the elders on Sunday night if it was
about that I'd stay home
too just show them I could just like
some of y'all like to do
that any believer can easily be here on
a Sunday morning occasionally can you be
here every Sunday or virtually every
Sunday can you be in Sunday school can
you do it can you be here Sunday night
can you be here Wednesday night fewer
here anybody can come occasionally
Sunday morning but fewer will push on to
be an apprentice of Christ an apprentice
apprentice of Christ that's what the
word disciple really means an apprentice
of Christ attending everything that's
possible for them and even fewer will
push on to real sacrifice in their life
because if you're not coming like that
let me tell you something that I just
about
know if you're not coming you're not
sacrificing in your life there's no real
effort to stop
sin not really you just kind of floating
along love this lesson didn't you can't
wait to have a few
more if we're not l next Sunday I'll be
shocked there is a
cost just like there was a cost to
preach this lesson
