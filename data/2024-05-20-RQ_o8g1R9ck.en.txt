so I graduated uh in
2002 in Willmore High School in South
Africa so you can all start doing the
math right now I know you're all doing
math I'm
old uh but my my brain doesn't believe
I'm old but my body does since leaving
school I have amassed about 22 years of
Rich diverse experiences I have 22 years
worth of stories non-fiction sorry not
fiction
but real life true
stories I have a passion for a
compelling narrative if you know me I
love to tell a story and I love hearing
a story the friends I surrounded myself
with from my school years onward would
love to gather and share captivating
stories about our
experiences over time our storytelling
and listening skills
improved uh I learned from those around
me and the more I listened the better I
became a Discerning between foolish talk
and and wisdom and truth and lies
because if you know my friends they can
spin a story right you learn to to to
see through
that but what ignited in me was an
insatiable
curiosity a curiosity to find the next
story I could share with my friends and
my family and so I began to
search search for the hilarious uh the
weird the outrageous the absurd and to
look under every Rock I could
find because I just wanted another story
I wanted to go to my friends and share
that experience with them and we can
laugh about it we can learn from it I
love that
Fellowship so consequently I have lived
a life full of
abundance I could recount stories of
mischief and
pranks yes
Dwight I love to prank Dwight by the way
it's it keeps me going through the week
I could tell you stories of exhilaration
such as skydiving out of plains and or
narrowly escaping a cliff while
snowboarding in a snowstorm we almost
went right over stories of sheer Terror
like being held a gunpoint in South
Africa stories of conquering fears
stories of Love such as finding my wife
on the other side of the planet when I
came for a vacation and had no in ition
of staying here God somehow guided me
this way stories of Sorrow losing loved
uh beloved ones stories of
Joy witnessing loved ones recover from
the brink of
death stories of Agony broken back in
surgery stories of prolonged suffering
stories of Hope and kindness stories of
malevolence stories of
Miracles stories of B of the bizarre and
peculiar like the time I was convinced I
spoke briefly with angels who redirected
my life in a in a short conversation who
were never to be seen again one of the
weirdest things in my life I don't know
how else to explain
that my point is we all have stories
everyone who sits here has a story in
Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created
the heavens and the earth now the Earth
was formless and empty Darkness was over
the surf surf of the deep and the spirit
of God was hovering over the waters and
God
said let there be light and there was
light this marks the beginning of the
greatest story we've all come to
know we learn about the story of Adam
and Eve we hear about a time I both Envy
in the
garden and I also am
embarrassed of what they did their story
continues through their sons and
daughters a tale of Cain and
Abel a story of jealousy and
tragedy The Narrative evolves into a
world of great
wickedness so much so that the story
maker initiates a great flood to cleanse
the world of the prevailing
corruption these stories are passed down
through generations through generations
through generations and in fact many
civilizations ancient civilizations have
recounted Tales of a great
flood a retelling to remind us of how to
replicate joyful times and caution us
against Behavior leading to catastrophic
destruction whether we Heed These
lessons or
not well that's another story
right we have at our disposal the
stories of the disciples and their
Journeys to know Jesus and God stories
of exil ation witnessing
Miracles imagine that witnessing
Miracles there stories of
Sorrow of death and
illness we read about their faith-driven
missions to teach adid ad midst
adversity I don't know about you but the
things that the the disciples
experienced I don't know if I could have
done that but I am in awe of their story
their stories influenced others like
Luke and
Paul who then lived out and shared their
stories with us and we still learn from
these storytellers to this very day and
all these stories are
interwoven and uh all connected some way
and have affected our
lives so it occurs to me that these
biblical uh stories are true accounts of
men and women who live their stories
intricately and beautifully woven with
each
other for what
purpose the complex biblical narrative
in its Simplicity illuminates the
consequences of
wickedness and the Fulfillment found in
righteousness through retelling
individual stories we we gain a clearer
understanding of life with or without
God what I find humorously ironic
is that no matter the story it still
brings glory to God hear me on this
one if you live a life of obedient
righteousness you bring glory to God by
proving him right about goodness
amen if you live a life of wickedness
and destruction you bring glory to God
by proving him right about
goodness you can't escape it
later on through all my stories that I
was accumulating I it dawned on me that
there must be more to my
story more to my life what is the
meaning what is the
purpose my eyes were open when one day I
read the book of
Ecclesiastes what an adventure that was
to read that
book I really related to it it it's a
book that challenged my very question
what what is the point of my life what
is
it and at some point my story on this
Earth will come to an end all our
stories will come to an
end our chapters will
close and it doesn't matter how rich I
was or how funny I was or how
good-looking I will always
be yep there it
is my wife loved harder than that um
what matters is the story I leave
behind I just hope and pray that my
story is one that leads people to God
and gives glory to
him haven't you noticed that when
someone dies we all gather together to
tell stories about that
person and to hear their story
again I find it so cool that this idea
of we all have stories and God spoke
into existence the universe and we have
a book with stories and lives that have
stories and when I say story I don't
mean uh the fiction stuff and the
fantasy and that kind of stuff I'm
talking about historical
accounts when I say a biblical story I
mean a historical account let me be very
clear on that because I know the world
tries to turn that word into some
fictional whatever I'm talking about
historical accurate
accounts so it occurs to me that we are
all a collection of these short
stories playing out in the greatest
story of
all what think about this what a
wonderful
privilege to be chosen to be in this
great book of the
Eternal really think about that your
story is in some way contributing sorry
contributing I got to learn the American
Rober what a privilege it is that God
has even taken the time to even think of
me to create me to create us to be an
addition to what he's
doing this great story and I get to be
part of this you get to be a part of
this often it's it's called like a a
film we get we're playing out in this
film right
it's all stories I love this our names
are written in the book can you imagine
the excitement the
excitement when we all gather with our
Lord to sit at his
feet mesmerized by how he accomplished
all of this I can't wait for that day
where I get to sit and just listen tell
me more tell me tell me more of the
stories maybe I get to run into Noah one
day dude how did you build that tell me
or Moses wow what a journey you went on
tell me your
story who knows maybe they turn around
and say hey Keegan tell me your story oh
wow we get to share in that fellowship
with one another uh to share in that
love the life the joy to tell our
stories to listen to each other at a
banquet at a
feast think about that we all sitting at
a banquet with our Lord and each other
and just the joy and the excitement and
the the chatter and oh this is so cool
and remember when this happened oh
yeah to share our stories
right so to our
graduates you too have a
story there is a road God has placed
before you that you have yet to travel
where are the graduates I see a couple
you along the way you will love you will
live you will laugh you will cry you
will get angry you will hurt you will
heal and more and more as you unveil
your
story
learn your choices and your reactions to
every situation will either ease or
complicate your
journey and I say that from
experience will either ease or
complicate your journey so I chose
proverbs 13:20 walk with the wise and
become wise for a companion of fools
suffers harm why did I choose this
graduates look around here tonight look
around at all the people sitting
here you are
surrounded by people who genuinely care
who genuinely care about each of you
some have known you all your all your
life your entire life there's a genuine
love here for
you all those people have a story to
share their story has led them to
God being here on a Sunday
night is dedication to
God so I challenge you to curiously
wonder what has happened to them that
has caused them to desperately depend on
God maybe they have stories that can
help you one day stories that help you
remain faithful and navigate difficult
times the people around you want to
share in your Joys your ups and your
Downs your highs and your lows but most
of all they want to see you shine for
God now I know this is a room filled
with quirky weird people we are a
church if you read what Jesus says he
came for the the sinners
you are surrounded in a community no
matter who we are or what we are we have
all been drawn together because of
Jesus and we all want to see you shine
we want to see you remain faithful we
want to see you
successful but we want to support you in
so many
ways use
that when you get out into the big bad
world and you realize how tough it is it
will blow your mind how people can
navigate through this world without
having a community like
this to pain and suffering I don't know
I do not know how people can navigate
without having a church
community so through all these stories I
find it unique that God calls us as
Christians to share one particular story
the story of the Gospel of Jesus and
salvation there's another
story when we are called to testify or
witness I am being called to tell my
story of how I came to know Jesus that's
how simple it is
testify this is how I got to know him
here's my life story it's that simple
that easy so I urge you to be led by
this calling I dare you to live your
your life grounded in the gospel make it
your goal that God's word does not
remain foreign to you but becomes a
natural Foundation to your life
story may God's glory be the ultimate
achievement that you constantly strive
for until you find yourself face to face
with
him may God bless you and keep you close
as you navigate the next phase of your
life may you be blessed with courage and
spiritual strength to reject the
adversary and fight for God's
glory may your life story be eternalized
in favor of the one who made us all
Jesus is King let us stand and sing
