all let's all stand together for the
scripture
reading good
evening tonight's scripture reading
comes from The Book of Matthew chap 13:
2 4 through 30 I will be reading from
The New American Standard
Version and the Bible
reads Jesus presented another Parable to
them saying the Kingdom of Heaven may be
compared to a man who solded good seed
in his
field but while his men were sleeping
his enemy came and sold tears among the
wheat and went away but when the wheat
sprouted and B bore grain then the tears
became evident
also the slaves of the land owner came
and said to him sir did you not seow
good seed in your field how then does it
have
tears and he has said to them an enemy
has done this the slaves said to him do
you want us then to go and gather them
up but he said no for while you are
gathering up the tears you may uproot
the wheat with
them allow both to grow together until
the
Harvest and in the time of the Harvest I
will say to the Reapers first gather up
the tears and bind them in bundles to
burn them up but gather the wheat into
my
barn you may be
seated I hear that Keegan said that or
predicted that well if Dwight's giving a
sermon we're going to get one on
gardening or
plants so I reminded him well the first
thing that God did for man was to create
a garden for him to take care of and
Jesus went to a garden to pray so that's
probably a good place to start and here
we are one on
plants if we study this verse it says
that it pertains to the kingdom of
heaven so we can't necessarily determine
whether this is talking about the
world or the church or both but I'm
going to apply it in my lesson tonight
mostly towards the
church now we tend to miss a lot of
valuable lessons in the Bible because we
don't incorporate the history the
cultural practices uh the background all
of those things and so we miss some very
keyy items in these stories we can
better get a better understanding of
what's going on if we know them Jesus
taught in Parables that is he used
examples that everyone there would know
exactly what he was talking
about well today many uh people think
that bread or milk comes from the
grocery store and it's a shock to them
to figure out that it comes from wheat
and cows well that's kind of like
understanding the wheat and the
tears uh as far as I can find tears are
not indigenous to North America however
they were mentioned in Greek literature
and they were obviously present both in
Europe and in
Asia it's also known as Darnell or
Zenia uh when it grows among wheat it's
almost indis distinguishable until it
reaches maturity and you can see in the
photograph there if you've been around
wheat it's very slight but if you pay
attention you can tell as it says in the
parable it's undesirable it's the result
of a malicious action by the enemy and
in this case that's Satan who presents
us with Temptations which we fall
into now we don't know exactly what ter
it is there's more than one but there's
two primary candidates that according to
Scholars and I'm May butcher the name
but one is
C sephilia
CIAA and when it's mature this has a
different growth form than wheat it
produces four branches at right angles
to the main stalk its seed is very
similar to wheat in size and shape it
itself is not toxic but if it's left
with wheat and ground into flour it will
make the flour extremely bitter
the most likely candidate is LAM to to
menu
lentum uh this is the candidate the best
candidate as it's virtually
indistinguishable from wheat in its
younger stages it matures at the same
rate at wheat it's also highly
susceptible to a fungus a poisonous
fungus called Urgot which can cause
weight loss convulsions diarrhea and
even death
usually the mature heads of the the uh
terar can be distinguishable at the
Harvest because you can see the black
toxin growing out of the seeds so that's
the reason why it says that at the time
of harvest the Harvesters could tell the
difference although we don't know which
kind of chair it is we it paints a vivid
picture of the Insidious nature of Tears
in the case of people this is their
ability to conceal or mask their true
purpose and
intentions chairs were potentially
deadly and that's why it was necessary
for them to be removed from the Harvest
uh wheat they don't belong in the wheat
and they will contaminate
it I grew up on a Farm Ranch so I
remember if we had plants we would get
weeds in those there were some plants
you couldn't uproot the breeds without
tearing up the roots of the the good
plants so you had to let that go and
separate it
later what we need to know though in
this Parable is that the tears will be
removed the lessons to be learned from
the parable of the tears is that tears
are the result of Satan and
Temptation Satan places many Temptations
and trials in the life of all Christians
some of us give into those
Temptations these Temptations are not
from God as we see in James 1
12-15 blessed is the man who perseveres
under trial for once he has been
approved he will receive the Crown of
Life which the Lord has promised to
those who love him let no one say when
he is tempted I'm being tempted by God
for God cannot be tempted by evil and he
himself does not tempt anyone but each
one is Led Away by his is enticed by his
own lust and when lust is conceived it
gives birth to sin and When sin is
accomplished it brings forth
death chairs are
subtle we may not be able to identify
them belonging to Satan because of their
deceitful nature and intent now when I
say we're talking about the church
maybe some of us are naive enough to
believe well that doesn't exist in the
church I'm sorry to say yes there are
tears in the church occasionally and
they conceal their identity and their
intent that means that they're
Insidious they conceal that Ma or mass
their
intentions that's why they're allowed to
grow un in inhibited see here on Earth
we can't necessarily look into someone's
heart and determine what their
intentions
are sometimes we have to let it
go there may be some we may suspect
someone is being a tear but if we try to
do something to remove them we may tear
up other Christians young Christians who
don't understand someone who doesn't
believe what's before them in evidence
so we have to just leave it as it
is we maybe can get a better
understanding of this by looking at some
biblical examples of tears and the first
is Judas motivated by greed and money
and he was a thief we read in John 12
4-6 but judas's kariot one of his
disciples who was intending to betray
him said why was this perfume not sold
for 300 dener ey and given to poor
people now he said this not because he
was concerned about the poor but because
he was a thief and as he had the money
box he used to piler what was put into
it many times we skip over these little
tidbits of information in the Bible we
get a very good picture that there was a
problem with Judas all
along it wasn't something new when he
betrayed
Christ in John 13:2 we see when during
supper the devil having already put into
the heart of Judas scariot the son of
Simon to betray him so there's what
we're talking about Satan SWS the seed
but we give in to the in uh
Temptation it wasn't evident obviously
to the rest of the disciples that Judas
had continual sin in his life and his
actions were motiv ated by greed they
trusted him they expected to his motives
and his intentions to be
honorable his outward actions appeared
to conform to someone who was committed
to God and following Christ but all the
while he was a thief who continually
pocketed money intended to help the poor
and then he had the audacity to publicly
condemn someone who was showing respect
and honor to Jesus
this was not a sin that Judas seemed to
struggle with and there certainly wasn't
one that he tried to control to any
degree the truth of the matter is he
felt justified in doing what he was
doing even though Jesus had most
certainly taught about it on several
occasions by not controlling it he
finally succumbed to an act of greed
which would culminate both in Jesus
death and his
own like a tear his true nature was
concealed
and it was not distinguishable from be
being a true disciple for quite some
time it might be worthy to note that the
one conducting a verbal tiate about Mary
about wasting money that could have been
used on the poor was
Judas sometimes those that are the most
active about pointing out the sins and
calling attentions to other sins are the
ones who are trying to draw attention
away from themselves because they are in
indulging in it that sometimes also
Catches Us unawares in the
church second was ananas and Safara
again Desiring men's praise and a desire
for
money we read in Acts 5 1-11 but a man
named ananas and his wife Safar sold a
piece of property and kept back some of
the price for himself with his wife's
full knowledge and bringing a portion of
it he laid it at the dis the apostles
feet but Peter said
ananas why has Satan filled your heart
to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back
some of the price of the land while it
remained unsold did it not remain your
own and after it was sold was it not
under your
control why is it that you have
conceived this deed in your heart you
haven't lied to men but to God and he
heard these words ananas fell down and
breathed his last and great fear came
over all those who heard it the young
men got up and covered him up and after
carrying him out they buried him now
there elapsed an interval of about 3
hours and his wife came in not knowing
what had happened and Peter responded to
her tell me whether or not you sold the
land for such and such a price and she
said yes that was the price and Peter
said to her why why is it that you've
agreed together to put the spirit of the
Lord to the test behold the feet of
those who have buried your husband are
at the door and they will carry you out
as well and immediately she fell at his
feet and breathed her last and the young
men came in and found her dead and They
carried her out and buried her beside
her husband and great fear came over the
whole church over all who had heard
these things see it wasn't the fact that
they had sold the land and kept some of
the
money they had that perfect right to do
it's just like the lesson from this
morning you have to make decisions about
you and your situation and make sure
that your requirements are taken care of
but what is your motive and see that's
the thing that should scare a lot of us
as
Christians God doesn't J must look at
actions he reads the
intent he looks into our heart and knows
why we do
something what they wanted was they
wanted to be oh look at us look what
we've done but we're going to keep some
of it by if they had said well here's
half of it we kept the other half there'
been no
problem perhaps it's just coincidence
but both of these cases involve money
agreed for it mishandling it or using it
to obtain our desires now that would
seem to relate directly back to the
parable of the sore in Matthew 13 and
how the deceitfulness of riches is one
of the primary reasons for sin to choke
out the effectiveness of the Bible in
our
lives certainly we must heed all the
warnings and be on special guard that
our attitude toward or toward money
could would corrupt us and cause us to
fall into temp excuse me
Temptation we need to know that tears
will be separated in the Judgment Day we
may not be able to do it here but God
will
judge we are to continue to being true
to God and not be
disheartened if there are t chairs in
the church we need to let God take care
of it that may be
difficult here we see that God knew
there were going to be Hypocrites in the
church he knew it he's he's telling us
they're going to be
there I'll take care of
it but this is kind of an excuse for
some of us who don't want to come to
church well I don't want to go to church
there's a bunch of Hypocrites down
there well we all kind of know what that
is that's another excuse
we're all as we say Sinners we're all
here because we need
help yes we're all Hypocrites to some
degree because all have sinned and
fallen
short and yet God tells us not to
forsake the Assembly of the Saints and
to
persevere in the parable we're studying
he tells us I'm going to take care of
him in time
in the Old Testament there's a story
about Hoff and
Phineas there they were recognizable as
Terr the people knew it it was obvious
what they were
doing what we need to look at if we
think we might be a
tear we need to look at how God looks at
us if we're a
tear in 1 Samuel 2
22-25 it says that now Eli was very old
and he heard all that his sons were
doing to all Israel how they lay with
the women who served at the doorway to
the tent of the meeting he said to them
why do you do such things the evil
things that I hear from all these people
no my sons for the report is not good
which I hear from the Lord's people
circulating if one man sins against
another God will mediate for
him but but if a man sins against God
who will intercede for him but they
would not listen to the voice of their
father for the Lord desired to put them
to
death then in 1st Samuel 31-14 it says
the Lord came and stood and called at
other times Samuel Samuel and Samuel
answered speak for your servant is
listening the Lord said to Samuel behold
I am about to do a thing in Israel at
which both ears of everyone who hears it
will tingle in that day I will carry out
against Eli all that I have spoken
concerning his house from beginning to
end for I've told him that I am about to
judge his house forever for the iniquity
which he knew because his sons brought a
curse on themselves and did not rebuke
them therefore I have sworn to the house
of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house
shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or
offering
forever it's a horrendous thing to
awaken to God's
Fury if he catches us polluting the
church he's going to exact a terrible
punishment upon us if we
do we need to understand just how angry
God gets when we do something to profane
the unity and righteousness of the
church Hebrews 1026 231 says for if we
go on sinning willfully after receiving
the knowledge of the truth there no
longer remains a sacrifice for sins but
a terrifying expectation of the judgment
and the fury of a fire which will
consume the
adversaries anyone who has set aside the
law of Moses dies without Mercy on the
testimony of two or three
Witnesses how much sever punishment do
you think he will deserve who has
trampled underfoot the son of God and
has regarded as unclean the blood of the
Covenant by which he was Sanctified and
has insulted the spirit of Grace for I
know for we who know him said vengeance
is mine I will repay and again the Lord
will judge his people it's a terrifying
thing to fall into the hands of a a god
who's angry at us
some recognizable Terrors are to be
removed
now now when we run across someone that
we can identify as a terror they are
causing severe problems within the
church one of the first things they're
going to say is well you can't judge
me I've heard that line a lot of times
whenever we've been talking to church
members and we call on their actions
well it it says you can't judge me well
it says that in one place but that's not
what it's referring
to those who are recognizable as
disobedient or openly leading a sinful
life are not to be tolerated or allowed
to be remain in the church 1 Corinthians
5 1-5 says it is actually reported that
there is immorality among you an
immorality of such of a kind that does
not even exist in the Gentiles that
someone has his father's wife you have
become arrogant and have not mourned
instead so that the one who had done
this deed would be removed from your
midst for I on my part though absent in
body but present in
spirit have
already judged
him he wasn't even at the location where
it was happening but he had heard the
multiple reports which
obviously he he knew he trusted the
people who gave him the reports and he
did Judge
them I have deliver I have decided to
deliver such a one to Satan for the
destruction of his flesh so that his
Spirit may be saved in the day of the
Lord
Jesus we need to remember this about
disfellowship first of all disfellowship
is something that we do not want to ever
take lightly or do often if we can
possibly do it and there is only one
valid reason for this fellowship and
that is to try to bring someone back to
a right relationship with
God and if we do have to do it we have
to be very very careful it is so easy to
hurt someone and we need to remember
what the Bible says says you who are
spiritual restore such a one in
gentleness lest you be overcome so
sometimes when we call someone on the
carpet we judge them and we say if you
don't stop doing this you're out of here
if they
repent you need to you need to be
careful
I'm telling you if someone has the
wherewithal to come up here to the front
and admit to all of us that they have
been guilty of
sin it is LIF shaking for them and they
are very vulnerable so we need to try to
be kind to them we need to try to
believe them occasionally someone's
going to come forward they're going to
say they've repent
and they haven't but that will become
evident in
time but if they have repented we need
to be careful about
that 1 Corinthians 59-13 says I wrote to
you in my letter not to associate with
immoral people I did not at all mean
with the immoral people of this world or
with the Covetous or swindlers or
idolators for then you would have to go
out of the world but actually
I wrote to you not to associate with any
so-called brother who is an immoral
person or Covetous or an idolator or a
reviler or a drunkard or a
swindler not even to eat with such a one
for what do I have to judge
Outsiders do you not judge those who are
within the church but those who are
outside God will judge
but remove the Wicked Man from among
yourselves Romans 16:17 through 18 it
says now I urge you Brethren keep an eye
on those who cause dissensions and
hindrances contrary to the teaching
which you learn and turn away from them
for such men are slaves not of our Lord
Jesus Christ but of their own appetites
and by their smooth and flattering
speech they deceive the hearts of the
unsuspecting
sometimes we have to do the hard
thing and we have to take someone to
task over their
sin I think we miss sometimes I know
initially I did and but when I became an
elder the story in Galatians 2
11-14 is Earth
shattering but when sephus came to
Antioch I opposed him to his faith
because he stood condemned for prior to
the coming of certain men from James he
used to eat with the
Gentiles but when they came he began to
withdraw and hold himself aloop fearing
the party of the
circumcision the rest of the Jews joined
him in hypocrisy with the result that
even Barnabas was carried away by their
hypocrisy when I saw that they were not
straightforward about the truth of the
Gospel I said to sephus in the presence
of all if you being a Jew live live like
the Gentiles and not like the Jews how
is it that you compel the Gentiles to
live like
Jews imagine here is one
Apostle in front of a church challenging
another Apostle and calling him on his
sin that's
major but it needed to be done and Peter
repented and just a little side
note what did Peter see Peter had
already seen that dream with the Sheep
coming down and and God telling him
everything is all right to eat
everything is now acceptable he had seen
that dream he had experienced that dream
so he had no excuse for doing what he
did Ephesians 5 1-12 says therefore be
IM ators of God as beloved children and
walk in love Jesus just as Christ also
loved you and gave himself up for us an
offering and a sacrifice to God as a
fragrant
Aroma but immorality or any impurity or
greed must not be even named among you
as is proper among Saints and there must
be no filthiness and silly talk or
coarse jesting which are not fitting but
rather
giving of thanks for this you know with
certainty that no immoral or impure
person or Covetous person who is an
idolater has an inheritance in the
Kingdom of Christ and God let no one
deceive you with empty words for because
of these things the wrath of God comes
upon the sons of
Disobedience therefore do not be
partakers with them for you were
formerly Darkness but now you are the
light of the Lord
walk as children of the light for the
fruit of the light consists in all
goodness and righteousness and Truth
trying to learn what is pleasing to the
Lord do not participate in the
unfruitful Deeds of Darkness but indeed
even expose them for it is disgraceful
even to speak of the things done by them
in
secret there is some good news
even if we should discover in our hearts
that we have become
Terror we can still repent and be
forgiven we have the parable of the
workers in the vineyard those who came
to work early in the morning those who
came at midday those who came at late
hour they all received the same award
because that was what they were told
they were going to
receive so if we should look in our
hearts and see that we have become
tears we just need to
repent come back do what's right protect
the Lord's church and be the light of
the
world if there's anyone who needs to
come forward has any need you're welcome
to do that now as we sing the invitation
