good evening church
you know you may be thinking well we
don't have many here tonight and that's
true but it wasn't long ago
that this would have been a fabulous
attendance
it wasn't long ago that we weren't
meeting outside
in the Heat or the rain
and we didn't have a place to meet
so I'm sorry things aren't perfect
tonight but
it is what it is and I'm grateful for
this amen and it's good crowd for the
amount of people we've actually got out
tonight at camp and be praying for them
so good evening church it's good to see
you uh
before we go any further let's begin
with a word of Prayer
Holy Father you've been so good to us
and sometimes we forget what we've just
been through how tough it was the people
we've lost
well let's not forget them
let's not forget how hard some of the
sickness was
not just on those who
faced it personally but on the families
and the people who are taking care of
them
we're grateful to be out of that zone
even though I'm sure there's still
troubles all around
Lord we're grateful to have a place to
meet we thank you for that we're
grateful that we have this number here
considering how many are out tonight we
pray a blessing upon the camp
and all those that are part of that we
pray that that will go well and that
maybe there will even be those who'll be
baptized and come to Christ this week
father
we pray father that as we study tonight
that you'll help us to learn that the
fruit of the spirit is one of the
greatest aspects of following you and
the gifts that the spirit and gives us
they help us love like you love
and to help us to have the joy that we
should have as your followers and we
pray you'll bless us with that tonight
it's in the name of Jesus we pray amen
now
um
I I this sermon is actually a very long
sermon
but I've cut out a bunch because I I
heard this story once years ago uh that
a young preacher went to a church out in
the country
and there weren't hardly anybody there
it's like in fact he thought there was
going to be a family and turned out
there's just one man
one man showed up to hear his sermon so
he thought well I put all this effort
into it I'm going to preach the whole
thing so he preached and he preached and
he preached and he preached any preached
and then
even went over a little bit you know
over the hour but they were dying and he
goes out and the man's standing there
and comes by and shakes his hand he said
good job preacher and he says did you
really think it's a good job he said
well yeah
he said what did you really think he
said well let me tell you fella um I
know you're a young preacher now this is
but I'm a farmer
then I raise cows
and said if I'm hauling some hay out to
where my cows are and I get out into the
field and there's only one cow there I
don't unload all the hay
so if everybody's not here maybe you
shouldn't go as long so that's what I'm
going to try to do tonight as a fruit of
the spirit it must be the desire of our
God to have us be joyful I mean why else
would the spirit give joy Ecclesiastes 2
26 which isn't connected the Holy Spirit
particularly but it says God gives
wisdom and knowledge and joy to a man
who is good in his sight so it is God's
will that you have joy that may not be
apparent Ecclesiastes 9 7 puts it this
way eat your bread with joy God has
accepted your Works Ecclesiastes 9 9
says live joyfully with the wife whom
you love all the days of your vain life
Under the Sun for that is your portion
in life and Nehemiah 8 and verse 10 it
says eat the fat drink the sweet and
send portions to those for whom nothing
is prepared for the joy of the Lord is
your strength God wants you to be joyful
that's a good message in it just that
God wants you to have joy but then we
need to ask well what is the joy that
God wants us to have
well the Hebrew word in the Greek word
virtually mean the same thing Joy means
mirth or gladness
but the lexam theological workbook
defines joy as the sense or state of
gladness or Elation that people
experience through their relationship
with God and through good things in
their lives so what lexam means is that
Joy is more a state of being
than an emotion and it's the result of
choice that you make so in other words
Joy has very little to do with what's
going on around you and it has to do
with a state of being with God and the
choices you've made so Joy is a fruit of
the spirit and thus the spirit makes us
joyful but how does he do it and this is
important just thoughts here before we
really get into the lesson and that is
the spirit does not make us live a life
pain-free
love it if that were the case but the
spirit doesn't force that situation the
spirit doesn't also make us live a life
without any Sorrows or grief that would
be a a lovely thing you could see how
someone might think that that's joy and
the spirit does not make us enjoy every
moment of our life here that even sounds
wonderful but that's not the case and
the spirit doesn't make us giddy all the
time no matter what the circumstance
that's not true either
but still the spirited Parts this deeper
fruit of Joy which is not as much of
emotion but awareness of a state of
being with God so I want to look at uh
down the list here we're going to look
at seven things but what I've done is
we're going to show you all the thoughts
we're going to look at but we're only
going to look at one of each one okay
the first idea is and let me move on
past that that's where we are here we go
suffering savior gives us joy by hearing
his word won't look at a verse on that
by finding his kingdom by believing his
resurrection all those that encourage
you to read I just want to focus on the
one Psalm 51 verse 12 which reads
restore to me the joy of your salvation
and uphold me by your generous spirit so
literally the spirit imparts it but it
is true that we are joyful simply
because we have a savior and we've been
saved if you know you're saved and you
the Savior has died for you that you
understand the cross the grace that's
been extended to you you should be in a
state of Joy I didn't say a state of
elation I didn't say it say jumping
around giddy all the time but you should
always be in a state of Joy simply
because you have a savior and you know
you've been saved by the grace of God
the second point I want you to see is
the indwelling spirit gives us joy and
this is critical and we won't read all
of these out as focus on the second one
up there by believing the Hope Romans 15
verse 13. now may the god of Hope fill
you with all joy and peace in believing
that you may abound in Hope by the power
of the holy spirit so literally one of
the ways that the holy spirit gives us
uh Joy is by giving us hope now hope is
not wishful thinking hope is a calm
Assurance the Bible doesn't talk about
hope the way we tend to talk about it
well I hope you'll catch some fish I
hope you'll have a good day it's a calm
Assurance so if you have hope you have a
calm Assurance coming from the Lord and
that's by the power of the Holy Spirit
and when you have a calm Assurance about
your life and about where it's going and
how you're living that gives you this
Joy we're talking about again it's not
so much an emotion as it is a state of
being a pleasant state of being number
three
and this one I I struggled with the word
struggle because I could have easily
just as easily put the word sorrow here
the ongoing struggles that we face in
this world it may not sound like it's
true but it gives us joy and I could
have just as easily said the ongoing
Sorrows that we face give us joy if you
don't believe that there's several
references here in fact the first three
make reference particularly that but I
want to focus on the third one up there
in Luke chapter 6 verses 22-23 and that
is weeping from persecution and by that
what I'm talking about and I I know you
think well I've never been through
persecution here's what I want you to
understand persecution does not mean
what we tend to make it mean that the
word means oh you've been beaten to
death or you're flogged in the morning
it just means that someone has pursued
you to do some harm to you or say
something harmful to you
that happens to every child of God every
single child of God has ugly things said
to them have ugly things done to them
that's just the way it is and if you
don't recognize that and you you haven't
been a child of God very long I'm
telling you you're going to have things
said and a lot of it will come from
church members it just happens that way
so what I don't focus on is what Luke 6
verse 22 says blessed are you when men
hate you and when they exclude you and
revile you and cast out your name is
evil for the son of man's sake now
clearly a lot of you have had this from
relatives and people outside the kingdom
who just don't like church they don't
like Church Christ they don't like us
that happens and you've experienced it
more than likely but it also comes from
within verse 23 though here's the thing
rejoice in that day and leap for Joy now
that's a hard thing to learn but if you
could learn to appreciate being hated
and I know that sounds crazy but you can
learn learn to appreciate being hated
and at this point you know you start you
enter the kingdom a little while and you
realize somebody said something ugly to
you and you go that's pretty cool
that's pretty cool so rejoicing that day
and leap for Joy for indeed your reward
is great in heaven for in like manner
their fathers did to the prophets you
should expect it to some degree and so
when it happens rather than going I
can't believe that happened I can't just
can't believe that that could happen but
the truth is uh a lot of times one of
the greatest blessings that come to us
in the sense of joy is after having wept
yeah you'd weep at first like going out
and sowing precious seed You Weep then
or if the Lord's chasing then you might
weep going through testings you might
weep But ultimately it brings that great
joy number four
inspiring Services give us joy and by
that I mean worship
the truth is is I don't know if you feel
this way but to me it's always been this
and not not because I'm preaching
believe me in fact I'll never forget
I've been in Services many many times
especially when I was young because I
was listening to the other guys and it
was I just couldn't understand why
somebody wouldn't want to be there
just hearing preaching or teaching
I never understood it it never made any
sense to me and some of the greatest
moments of my life been sitting at the
foot of preachers that were preaching
over me I'm just I loved it even now I
love to be in a Bible class and hear
somebody teach over me had a great time
this morning uh listening to you Trent I
I love it I love to sit and listen to
somebody else teach me but more than
that in worship worshiping God for his
creation I just want to focus on that
one this comes from Job 38 this actually
happened and it's a we've let been led
into a moment before there was time
and Job 38 verse 4 says where were you
when I laid the foundations of the earth
so the foundations before the Earth
right
tell me if you have understanding who
determined its measurements surely you
know who stretched the line upon it
to what were its foundations fastened I
mean what's the Earth fashion to or who
laid its Cornerstone verse seven when
the morning Stars sang together they
still met the angels of God when they're
often referred to as stars in the Old
Testament when the morning Stars sang
together so when God was creating the
world there was a jubilant singing going
on and all the sons of God shouted for
joy
that was pretty loud sorry
but the point is is that when we worship
God and one of the reasons we'll worship
God is first great creation
what a source of joy that is to all of
us so I think worship services in
general are inspiring to us all I really
do even when it's not all that great
it's not inspiring you think I still
think it's inspiring I think it is
number next the fellowshipping Saints
with us focus on one again let's look at
that last one down there the
fellowshipping Saints give us Joy by the
Saints walk in third John 1 verse 4 I
love what John says here about those
he's worked with he makes this simple
statement I have no Greater Joy isn't
that nice I have no Greater Joy than to
hear that my children the people that
I've taught that my children walk in
truth
there's nothing better than
that to just know
you know what's wonderful it's been 30
years since you see somebody 40 years
youn worship with somebody and some of
you are a little older you know what I'm
talking about and then you hear oh yeah
they're faithful they're working the
churches that church down there they're
still going are that that guy he's still
preaching or he's still an elder over
there that's one of the greatest things
just to know that you're not the only
one you know plowing you know what I
mean that you're serving the lord where
you are but to hear that someone else is
people that you know that are staying
faithful to it it's No Greater Joy than
that I and I think that's true
especially if you taught that person if
you taught somebody and now they're
faithful and I know what's to me one of
the most wonderful things is those that
I've taught in the past are now elders
and deacons in the church that I'm like
I'm like wow they're still faithful
after all this time it's a wonderful
thing
the expecting sureness gives us joy I
don't want to get into all these I think
all these would be great but we'll just
look at the first one by expecting
Everlasting Joy Isaiah 51 verse 11 says
this for The Ransom of the Lord shall
return
and come to Zion with singing
Now The Ransom of the Lord the ransomed
not the ransom that the ransom that's a
you know
past tense So it's talking about people
the ransomed of the Lord shall return
and come to Zion with singing with
Everlasting Joy on their heads
they shall obtain joy and gladness
sorrow and sighing shall flee away
when God moves in your life in such a
way as you get to return to him maybe in
that case you've wandered away
but you come back to the Lord
wow and and you say well I've never left
the church yeah yeah
yeah yeah
you leave it Monday morning sometimes
leave it Saturday afternoon
well I've never denied the Lord every
time you sin you deny the Lord
every time you step back from what's
right and turn you back on the church
so
when you know you've kind of really
messed up whatever it was
had a really bad week or a bad month or
bad six months or whatever it was and
you come back from that and the joy of
knowing you know I messed up but Lord
forgive me anyway
the joy of that the sureness that that
gives you
what a great blessing that is all right
let's go to the next one
the Everlasting State gives us joy and I
I all of these I'd love to focus on but
I'm just going to look at the third one
there and go to Thessalonians first
Thessalonians 2 verses 19 and 20. for
what is Our Hope
or Joy or crowd of rejoicing what is it
that we
as Christians
what is it that we want more than
anything else what is it what is it
that's going to be the crown on our head
well you know you talk about Halos what
really is the source of the Halo what is
it what is Our Hope or Joy or crown of
rejoicing listen to this answer is it
not even you
in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ
it is coming for you are our glory and
joy if we help each other get to heaven
and we walk together through the doors
will there be I
mean let me put it this way okay you
ever been anywhere sightseeing
been somewhere excited you ever been
alone science in here's the way it is
hey do you
you see
there's no joy so if you like
sightseeing without anybody you really
are recluse the rest of us want to be
with somebody okay if you want to go to
a special place you want to go to a
resort you don't want to go by yourself
you want to go with somebody right why
because it's the sharing of it that is
the joy it's not just you enjoying it
it's the sharing of it here's the thing
salvation going into heaven it isn't
Heaven that would make Heaven if I'm the
only one there I don't want to be there
that's hell to me
I would not want to be in heaven alone
oh God means got it
I wouldn't be miserable to me
wouldn't it be to you
but it is the joy of walking through and
saying hey look there's John
that's Janet over there I haven't seen
her in 30 years
the joy
there's the joy
and I think all of them are are
important but we'll just focus on that
so tonight here's kind of a summary of
some of the things that produce the joy
and this is not a complete list these
are just some of the things I encourage
you to get this and look it up and maybe
do a little study this week I'm trying
to save you a little time because I
didn't want to feed you all my hay
tonight but uh didn't want to wear you
out but just think about it the
suffering savior the knowledge that God
would allow his son to suffer for you
and me to save me should bring great joy
to your heart the indwelling spirit
knowing that God imparts his Spirit
within us and as a result we get hope we
get love the ongoing struggles or the
ongoing Sorrows for that matter but the
ongoing struggles within us it's the
source of Joy knowing that God is still
working with us the inspiring worship
services that we attend I ongoing all
the time you said well it wasn't all
that inspiring well maybe you didn't put
anything into it you know the singing
was great the prayers were great the
contribution was great the Lord's Supper
was great what did you not get
and then the fellowshipping Saints
what a great joy that is just to be with
each other
and the expecting sureness when you
begin to realize that something Greater
is Coming not just that God's given me
joy but he's given me love and he's
given me life and
perfection's on its way
I get to experience Perfection one day
and then the Everlasting state which we
all look forward to being with the Lord
true Joy
I want to talk about two things true Joy
is again I say it again it's more a
state of being than an emotion if you're
looking to feel happy
and giddy then you're you don't
understand what Joy is it's got no
connection to either of those directly
rather it is a an awareness that creates
a joy within you because of choices
you've made with the father and because
of what extends to you
so there was a Russian countess
that
became a follower of the Lord Jesus
and she's very open about her faith
she's telling everybody she believed in
Jesus well the Tsar didn't take kindly
to it
he didn't believe
and he was mad so he decided to throw
her in jail through in prison he didn't
throw her in prison but he put her in
about one of the lowest worst dungeons
that they had at the time and kept her
there for 24 hours scaring her to death
he thought
it was probably one of the most
miserable conditions you can be in I
mean back in have you ever been in in a
dungeon I mean I've only been in one in
my life and that was in Scotland and
it's just no light it's Pitch Black
the floor is not level
you can't tell where he's stepping
it's awful
and the door closes
um so that's where she was overnight we
I suppose with other people who weren't
doing right
most miserable conditions that you could
imagine
the next day he brought her out again
brought her before him and he smiled
pretty arrogantly at her when he said
well are you ready now to renounce your
silly faith and come back to the
pleasures of the Court
and to his surprise the countess
smiled serenely and said this
I have known more real Joy
in more real happiness in one day in
prison with Jesus
than I have known in a lifetime in the
court of the czar
she found out what real Joy was
real Joy
now true Joy is not only more a state of
being
but it's a shield of faith and assurance
that protects us from
the pits of despair
this happened in
um
in in Austria
Messina who was one of Napoleon's
generals
Came Upon A an Austrian town with
eighteen thousand soldiers
and Camp just outside of town ready to
destroy the town and take the town
the Town Council met and said well we
need to immediately give up we don't
have any kind of Defense here
we're going to be destroyed if we don't
give up
and they all agreed that's what they
needed to do
otherwise they'd all die maybe some
would be saved and be spared
and so that was their decision but just
before they decided to go ahead and do
it right then one of the old church
leaders reminded them you know guys
it is Easter Sunday
uh
let's just wait let's just hold worship
services
and leave the trouble to the good Lord
to do whatever he wants to do
so that's what they decided okay we'll
do that we're going to have worship
service this morning and
so that's what they did
so the French that were surrounding them
18 000 soldiers no problem to take this
little town
hearing the church bells ring joyfully
as they're calling everybody to serve us
concluded that an Austrian Army had come
to relieve the place and so they quickly
broke camp and left and before the bells
stopped ringing all the Frenchmen all 18
000 had disappeared
now the incident has duplicated itself
in the lives of Christians many many
many times I don't know if you thought
this through but stay with me just a
moment on this Christians
when they Ring The Joy bells in their
life
when they're facing pain
if you ring the bell
the bells of Joy when you're facing a
sickness
if you go ahead and ring the bell
when you're facing poverty
you can't pay all your bills
if you go ahead and ring the bells when
you're afraid when you go ahead and ring
the bell when you're lonely you go ahead
and ring the bell of joy not I'm it's
everything's wonderful but just I'm in a
right relationship I'm going to be in a
right relationship I am going to worship
God I have that Joy when you do that
you've already conquered the foes of
Darkness
and you already possess the field
and no enemy is quite as strong
as a person who can have faith
and Joy No Matter What Joy anyway
just have Joy anyway so receive the
fruit of the spirit in joy and seek the
sources of joy and I only touched on
these and encourage you to look at it
much deeper than I've done tonight but
it is important to realize that there
are many sources of these Joys these are
not the list that's you think I've
covered everything that has to do with
your no but joy will strengthen you for
whatever may come you see it's not this
giddiness that everybody wants it's not
the party fun it's just
I'm happy no matter what happens I'm
full of joy no matter what happens how
can you be
because I'm going to heaven because I'm
right with God because God's grace is
good enough to save even me that his
Love Lifted Me that I'm
his
now if you're not he is you don't have
that joy and so maybe there may be
someone here who maybe studied and wants
to complete their salvation tonight
that's a possibility if you need to
repent confess be baptized we'll be
happy to help you do that if you need to
come back to the Lord because you've
wondered why be happy to do that but the
truth is is that if you're a child of
God here tonight there's no reason for
you to be sitting there and grimacing
over everything that's going wrong in
your life you should have the joy of
knowing God is with you it's going to
work out somehow someway someday
but if you need to come come while we
stand while we sing
foreign
