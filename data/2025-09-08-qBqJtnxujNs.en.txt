Even though married couples,
I don't know what that's like, but even
though married couples
need and want affirmation
from their mates, you say, "Well, we've
been married 50 years," which we're
coming up on, by the way. June will be
50 years for us. So, even after 50
years, do you really need to hear I love
you or
I'm with you or I'm for you?
an old married couple were uh driving
probably to Walmart in their vehicle,
probably a truck,
and the wife suddenly said, "You know,
you remember when we used to sit close
together while we drove?" And I I'm
going to have to tell you, I remember
when my uh girlfriend sat on the brake.
She doesn't do that anymore
in a little bitty compact car. Remember
when we used to sit close together while
we drove
and the man grabbed the steering wheel
and said, "Well, I haven't moved."
It changes over time, doesn't it?
Noah was in a movie, and that's not Noah
though, Noah in the ark. Y'all will know
this. It was called The Notebook. Uh was
a film. He was a character. He was in
love with a girl named what was it? Uh
I don't remember now what her name was
Ally. Is that it? I think it was Ally in
the movie The Notebook. And he wrote her
at one point in the movie a letter every
day. She didn't get the letters, but he
wrote her a letter every day trying to
win her love back. And Ryan Goslin was
the character in that. Um but there
really is a Ryan Goslin kind of if you
will in a real notebook story. Um Tom's
River uh resident Bill
Breastman
when this was written he was 74 so he
may be gone now.
He wrote a love letter every day to
Kristen Breston his wife. She is 74 as
well. They'd been married 40 years at
the time.
More than 10,000 more than 10,000
filed chronologically in 25 boxes.
And if he's still alive, he continues to
this day writing his wife a love letter
every day. He said this, "All the
letters are signed, I love you, my
darling, with an infinity sign." He told
ABC News, "They're essentially a love
diary. For example, I could pick out a
day in 1982 and it'll begin with the
restaurant we ate in or a movie we saw
and then the reaction had to that."
These daily expressions of love began as
just notes scribbled on napkins in
restaurants or where they were having a
cup of coffee as they were growing to
love each other.
He says she was this beautiful northern
European woman who struck me like a bolt
of lightning and he's written to her
every day.
written at times multiple letters on any
given day.
He said this, "I see youngsters at
restaurants." The reason he's talking
about this, he said, "I see youngsters
at restaurants sitting across from each
other buried in their screens,
but never talking or looking at each
other." Have y'all seen that?
Have you done that?
I want them to enjoy the time they have
with each other and treasure it.
And then he went on to say, "We'll
probably on talk about Valentine's Day,"
because this was leading up to
Valentine's Day, the reason they even
did the article said, "We'll probably
have a nice dinner. We'll pass the
cravings. We're way past the cravings
for jewelry and expensive nonsense.
We just enjoy simply being together.
And then he'd write her, he's already
written her a bunch of letters.
It may seem silly and maybe it even
seems maybe self a grandisement for him
to talk about the letters he's written
his wife. Whatever you think of that,
let me tell you something that is for
him. They need to hear it.
Affirmation
is essential.
By the way, it's essential in this
little crowd.
You need to be glad to see each other
and make it clear and even tell them
why.
I think we all crave affirmation, but I
think what we crave most of all is
affirmation for from our holy father.
I think that's what we seek more than
anything else. Romans 8:16, the Spirit
himself bears witness with our spirit
that we are children of God. What more
do you want but affirmation that I'm
right with God, that I'm in the right
place at the right time with the right
attitude. What more do you want in life
but to hear well done?
I think it's what we all crave. We may
not be aware of it. I think sometimes we
think it's about trying to please our
own fathers or our own mothers. I don't
think that's what that's about. I think
that's what we think it's about because
maybe we didn't feel like mom or dad
appreciated us or spanked us too much or
whatever. But it's really about getting
that affirmation from the father. Well,
today you get to experience what it's
like. a little bit of uh giving
affirmation. I want to walk through
about three lessons. That's going to be
it. Okay. There should be no self
commendations. That's kind of what I was
talking about. Elders can't vote on
themselves. Preachers can't vote on
themselves. You can't vote on yourself.
If you're a candidate, you can't vote on
yourself. If you do, we're going to
ignore that one. Okay? We really are.
And when your name's going to be on it,
we're going to look at and say, "Scratch
that. That doesn't count." Because just
because you like yourself doesn't mean
anybody else does. Right. Right.
Second Corinthians 3:1 read a while ago
says, "Do we begin again to commend
ourselves
or do we need as some others epistles of
commendation to you or letters of
commendation from you? Do I have to get
up here and beg you to write a letter
for me?" It shouldn't be, should it? 2
Corinthians 5:12. For we do not commend
ourselves again to you, but we give you
opportunity to boast on our behalf, that
you may have an answer for those who
boast in appearance and not in heart.
Isn't that what we should do?
2 Corinthians 10:12 says uh for we dare
not class ourselves or compare ourselves
with those who commend themselves but
they measuring themselves by themselves
and comparing themselves among
themselves are not wise that's not wise
2 Corinthians 10 and verse 18 says for
not he who commends himself is approved
but whom the Lord commends that's the
one that's approved True. So this gives
a doorway an opportunity today to
commend others. Something you may never
have done on paper before.
Might be a good thing to start. A little
card, a little encouragement. Amen. On a
piece of paper or a phone call or a
visit and a word of encouragement. So
there's no self-commendations.
We must give commendations. We must give
affirmation and it should be a part of
our life because the Lord does it and
affirms you as his children. Number two,
there should be no shunning
commendations. Oh, I know we want to
feain humility.
And that's what that is, by the way. Oh,
I no.
Stay with me. Acts 18 verses 24-28. I'll
just read part of it is on the screen,
but I'm going to read a little more
here. Now, a certain Jew named Apollos,
born in Alexandria, an eloquent man.
This is being said in the scriptures,
mighty in the scriptures. Is he being
affirmed through the written word
through the Holy Spirit? I think that
may be what this is. Came to Ephesus.
This man had been instructed in the way
of the Lord. And being fervent in
spirit, he spoke and told accurately the
things of the Lord that he knew only the
but he knew only the baptism of John.
So, he began to speak boldly. That's six
things. When Aquilla and Priscilla heard
him, they took him aside and explained
to him the way of God more accurately.
Verse 27, which is on your screen. And
when he desired to cross to Aaya, the
brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples
to receive them. And when he arrived, he
greatly helped those. That's I think
that's seven things. Those that have
been ble believed through grace. Verse
28 goes on to say, "For he vigorously
refuted the Jews publicly, showing from
the scriptures that Jesus is the
Christ." Is it appropriate to commend
and affirm people? I believe you just
got proof, didn't you? That not only is
it right, it is wrong not to.
In 1 Corinthians 16:3, it says, "And
when I come whomever you approve by your
letters, I will send to bear your gifts
to Jerusalem." So, not only is it right
to affirm, it would therefore be wrong
to shun what comes from the Holy Spirit.
Do you follow me? Now, you might think
that this is a silly practice.
You may write it off as, "I've never
seen that done before." What difference
does that make? It is not a silly
practice. It is a right thing to do and
quite honestly we ought to do more of
that. We should affirm people. We should
go out of our way to affirm people
especially when we see wonderful things
within them. Amen. Amen. Walls.
2 Corinthians 12:1. I have become a fool
in boasting. You have compelled me. For
I ought to have been commended by you.
For nothing was I behind the most
eloquent apostles though I am nothing.
Now that's Paul saying, "You should have
said something." So not only was he not
foreshunning commendation or
affirmation, he was shaming them for not
giving even him more.
What I'm trying to suggest to you is is
it's more gracious. Listen to me. Uh
elders, candidates and elders, it's more
gracious. And by the way, ladies, listen
to me closely because ladies, you get
this probably more than anybody else.
Probably ladies get complimented way
more than men because men are ugly even
at their best.
Just look in the mirror, gentlemen.
Amen.
So,
women get complimented.
Don't throw that aside.
Thank them for it.
Quit being what you think is humble.
Quit shunning it. It is inappropriate to
shun a compliment because you're not
being gracious. You're being rude.
Are you hearing me? Ladies, accept it.
You're not being humble.
To be humble is to accept it graciously.
Amen. Walls.
Wow. That's women. So, it must be right.
There's no shunning commenation.
You must receive commendemnation and
you're supposed to.
Number three,
there should be no secret commenation.
That's why your name's going on these
pieces of paper. By the way, you need to
probably start folding it up if you're
through. Let me speak to you about this
third point. It's not going to be that
much longer. Proverbs 3:es 3 and 4. Let
no mercy and truth forsake you. Bind
them around your neck. Write them on the
tablet of your heart. Verse four. And so
find favor and high esteem in the sight
of God and man. Yes, we want God to
affirm us. Yes, we want to be in secret
prayer. Yes, we want secret affirmation
from the Lord. But it should not be
secret. We should be commended by
others. If we're not behaving as a
Christian in such a way that other
people's ca other people don't see it,
we're not behaving like a Christian. Do
you hear me, class? If you aren't being
seen as a Christian, we're not behaving
like a Christian.
Somebody ought to see it. Somebody, your
kids, your wife, your husband, your
grandparents, somebody ought to at least
say, "Boy, that is such a good person."
Somebody ought to be saying it.
Not just God. 2 Corinthians 3:2, "You
are our epistle written in our hearts,
known and read by all men."
Let me tell you what people know about
this church, not our advertising.
I don't believe in advertising for a
church. Now, I know the elders may think
differently, and that's fine. They'll do
whatever the elders do. I I don't have a
vote on that. Let me tell you where I
think the advertising is. You your
behavior, not your words, not your
invitations. Your behavior is our
advertising. What we do as a church is
our advertising. If we aren't doing for
others, Amen. We're not doing for
others. What kind of advertising is
that? That's the only real advertising
there is. The rest of it is self
arandizing.
a little bit proud. Don't really believe
in it. I'd rather be unknown than only
known by the things I bragged on myself
about.
Second Corinthians 4 and verse two, but
we have renounced the hidden things of
shame, not walking in craftiness and
handling the word of God deceitfully,
but by manifestation of the truth. They
ought to hear us speaking the truth,
commending ourselves to every man's
conscience in the sight of God. We ought
to be bragging about God.
Bragging about God. Amen.
So 2 Corinthians 8 verse 21 says,
"Providing honorable things not only in
the sight of the Lord, but also in the
sight of men." You know, God may think
uh these five men are great
secretly. They He may be in heaven
going, "Man, they really picked the best
of the bunch." Right?
But they should hear it from us.
There's no secret combinations. We must
publicly commend you. Okay. So, that's
basically the lesson today. Uh, I got a
little story to tell you. And that's
pretty much it. But should be no self
accommodation. So, don't vote on
yourself ever.
Don't ever brag about yourself anywhere.
Ever.
ever. I know they'll tell you in
business, "Oh, you need to toot your own
horn or nobody will toot it." No, it'd
be better if it's never tooted. Amen.
Stop the tooting.
Oh, sorry about that. That didn't sound
right.
No shunning combinations.
No secret commendations.
Nador
fores, that's the way you pronounce it.
looks like andor fos
is a renowned Hungarian pianist from
Budapest.
He once recalled how praise had made the
difference for him.
He rec recollected a day when he was
seven
and his father gave him a kiss on his
forehead
and he thanked his father thanked him
for working in the garden that day and
working so hard. Just seven.
His dad pulled him aside, kissed him on
the forehead
and thanked him.
Six decades later, he was writing this
article.
how important that kiss was to him. That
that little affirmation from his father
that you when you tell your kids
and you think they don't know and they
don't notice six decades later he's
writing about it. But then he told about
that was the beginning of this kiss of
affirmation
that changed his life. At 17 he was
living in Budapest.
Forest
was already a skilled pianist
and it was a low period in his personal
life. Been a very troubled year but he
was to play before the a renowned
pianist of his day Emil von Sauer. Now I
don't know these names but he was a
German composer and pianist and p
pianist and a piano teacher.
He was famous in his own right
and he is the last surviving pupil this
sour was the last surviving pupil of
Fran's list or Fran's lust
also a Hungarian composer and a virtuoso
pianist
sour requested now this is the story of
fors okay or forish
sour requested the young Fords to play
for him
and he did and he played some of the
most difficult works of Bach Beethoven
and Schuman. When he finished sour
walked over to him and kissed him on the
forehead.
Now he's 17.
This is what he said to him. My son,
when I was your age, I became a student
of lifts.
the guy who lived before him 1811 to
1886
became a a student of Litz. He kissed me
on the forehead after my first lesson
saying, "Take care of that kiss.
It comes from Beethoven
who gave it to me after hearing me play.
I have waited for years to pass on this
sacred heritage, but now I feel you
deserve it. So here's what happened.
There was a kiss
on a forehead of approval from Beethoven
in 1770 to 1827 somewhere in there. And
then Beethoven kids lits when he
finished playing lived somewhere between
1811 and 1886. and lit hits sour on the
forehead somewhere living between 1862
and 1942 and the sour kiss foss
1913 and 1992
that's a kiss from Beetho
when we give approval
it just comes from us
but the approval has come down
first from Jesus
to his apostles
to those who are taught to those who are
taught to those who were taught. It's a
holy kiss.
