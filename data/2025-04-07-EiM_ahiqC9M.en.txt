church has been a tough few uh weeks for
me I've uh suffered some earachches some
toothaches Uh I haven't slept
much Let's go back
there There you go Haven't slept much
Um and then yesterday we had a youth
event uh at Bush Gardens So that was a
long day And then you know the night
before you preach you're thinking did I
say am I saying the right things And you
know your brain goes you don't sleep
much So if I fall down today um just
roll me off the
stage and uh allow my wife that
privilege We know she deserves
that I wanted to welcome all of you here
I wanted to welcome our visitors Please
know I am not the regular preacher Our
regular preacher is away today and
that's what this is about I had this on
my desk on Friday and uh if anyone asks
this is where Deb and I are for the
weekend from
Rex So
uh was anyone
asking Nope Let the record show No one
asked
Rex I appreciate
him Hello darkness my old friend Psalm
88 In the Bible we encounter various
expressions of pain and
darkness From the laments of Job to the
cries of David One of the most profound
passages of lament comes from Psalm 88
where the psalmist uh Hemon or Hemon I
like to say He-Man because there's kind
of an ironic poetic thing going on here
expresses deep anguish He's feeling
utterly forsaken by God In his words we
hear the raw emotions of someone trapped
in the grip of darkness with no
resolution in
sight So the question begs why would
God put this in his eternal
word His eternal word that lasts forever
We're going to have this passage for all
time
Let's
pray Our dearest
God we come into your presence now
Father we just want to praise your holy
name Thank you for the God that you are
Uh Father we come into your presence
willingly today But sometimes it's
reluctantly Sometimes it's in anguish
It's in pain It's in anger It's in
frustration Father forgive
us But where better to go than to you
with uh with our sorrows and our
heartaches and our griefs to lament to
you Father So we just want to thank you
so much for being a God who not who not
who doesn't ignore us but who actually
encourages us to turn to him when we are
struggling And Father as we look into
this passage uh of darkness let us see
the light the light that is Jesus the
light that you have shown us the light
that you have given us We thank you so
much for uh everything you do And it's
in your son's name Jesus Christ we pray
Amen Psalm 88 Let's read
it Oh Lord God of my salvation I cry out
day and night before you Let my prayer
come before you Incline your ear to my
cry Here we go For my soul is full of
troubles and my life draws near to Shiel
I am counted among those who go down to
the pit I am a man who has no strength
Like one set loose among the dead like
the slain that lie in the grave like
those who you remember no more
For they are cut off from your
hand You have put me in the depths of
the pit in the regions dark and
deep Your wrath lies heavy upon me and
you overwhelm me with all your waves
Salah which is a pause in in the
songwriting You have caused my
companions to shun
me You have made me a horror to them I
am shut in so that I cannot escape and
my
eyes my eye grows dim through sorrow
Every day I call upon you oh Lord I
spread out my hands to
you Do you work wonders for the
dead See the sarcasm here Do you do the
departed rise up to raise uh to praise
you Is your steadfast love declared in
the
grave or your faithfulness in
Abdon Are your wonders known in the
darkness or your righteousness in the
land of
forgetfulness But I oh Lord cry to you
in the morning My prayer comes before
you Oh Lord why do you cast my soul away
Why do you hide your face from
me Afflicted and close to death from my
youth up I suffer your terrors I am
helpless Your wrath has swept over
me Your dreadful assaults destroy
me They surround me like a flood all day
long They close in on me together
You have caused my beloved and my friend
to shun me My companions have become
darkness
Wow what a uplifting scripture
Right So I want to warn you this is
known as the darkest psalm in the book
Um and I'm willing to bet most of us
have been in this place Most of us have
been
frustrated Most of us have not
understood Um I know I have and I'll
share that with you today
But this is
difficult And I'm amazed that God
himself would leave this in his word the
almighty God who could easily go "We're
not going to handle this disrespect this
this borderline blasphemous
blasphemy." He puts it in his word And
I'm I'm curious by that I'm I'm actually
I find great comfort in that And we'll
see as we go So does this darkness mean
that I'm lost In uh Jesus himself in
John 8:12 he says "I am the light of the
world Whoever follows me will never walk
in darkness but will have the
light of life
But darkness still
comes Psalms 23:4 says assures us that
when we walk through the the darkest
valley we need not fear because God is
with
us But yet like
Hmon sometimes it can feel as though God
has abandoned us and we are left in the
darkness
struggling So I'm not talking about the
darkness the unknown darkness where we
do not even know God those who haven't
even come to know him yet that they're
living in darkness they don't even know
about that I'm talking about the known
darkness the darkness this guy feels
something he's
feeling and he almost terrified
of the darkness we're talking about the
darkness we all struggle with in Psalm
88 it opens up with um oh Lord God of my
salvation I cry out day and night before
you so I'm not talking about the
darkness that we don't even know God He
knows God He's crying out to God So what
is he
feeling And he continues through a
series of agonizing statements and
questions And the psalmist wonders where
God has gone and why he seems
absent But the most remarkable part of
the psalm and others like it is that
these cries are included in scripture
God knows our despair and our pain and
even in our moments of doubt
Psalm 88 doesn't have doesn't come to a
resolution It doesn't resolve itself All
the other psalms you can read it's like
woe is me H my life is terrible Ah but I
stepped into your sanctuary and then I
understood or I I am with you always
There's this resolve that culminates at
the end of the Psalms But in 88 and and
I'd argue in chapter 39 as well it
doesn't resolve
It's left almost unanswered in this
darkness So why would God allow this
Like I said disrespectful borderline
blasphemous
potentially It tells me at the very
least he understands He
knows He knows how it feels to be
desperate to cry out to wonder if he's
even listening The psalm and others like
it reveal that even in our darkest
moments God is still present with us
offering us grace even when we can't
perceive it Think about that This man
cannot even perceive that grace that we
we know about And he's he's angry He's
bitter But our loving
father puts that in there cuz he hasn't
he hasn't left him
in God is proclaiming that he is God of
this man even though he's not getting it
right at all Speaking to God this way
what a patient loving father he is I see
a lot of comfort in that Even though
it's dark I see so much light
here So darkness can come in many forms
Often we have this outward darkness in
the circumstances of our life Things are
going wrong We all you know we all have
our complaints We all have our struggles
But if we inwardly know that God is with
us it seems that those outward
circumstances are easier to handle
We have a situation here that he man is
proclaiming that he has outward
circumstances that are struggles and
inwardly he's in despair because he
feels that God has abandoned him that
God has turned away that God he believes
that God was angry with him that God has
turned away in such moments our faith is
tested how we react in these moments can
be
revealing See church the reality of
Christianity this is the other thing I
like about the scripture The reality of
Christianity isn't always easy It isn't
always rainbows and butterflies that
we're led to believe Oh come be a
Christian Everything's going to be fine
It'll be
great I I always think of Satan seeing
us being
baptized and uh I don't imagine him
standing there clapping going "Oh great
decision Well done." Right Imagine a
target being painted on our
backs So while we're promised the light
of Christ the scriptures also
acknowledge that there will be times of
darkness You could be serving like human
in the house of David He was a
songwriter and a musician And we see in
Chronicles 1 Chronicles you could be
serving in that capacity serving
God and still find yourself in darkness
Uh David a man after God's own heart
lamenting crying out because of the loss
of his
child finds himself in this darkness
lamenting over and over and
over And God's word what I find here is
not selling us anything It's not selling
us a a like a a used car salesman It's
not selling us anything It's just
brutally honest This is brutally honest
Our lives are difficult
And I praise the Lord for leaving this
in to remind me that he's always going
to be there for
us The Bible is confronting It's telling
us the truth about our confronting
journey that is on this earth And I want
to get into that a little bit uh later
But take for instance Job chapter
1 Job is described as a blameless and
upright man He uh feared God and shunned
shunned evil That's a that's a really
amazing description of this man And it
also goes on to say that when Job's
children came to visit they would have
like birthday parties or something and
and Job would get up in the morning and
he would go and he would sacrifice on
behalf of his children because and get
this it says Job says
um that perhaps my children have sinned
and cursed God in their hearts
Job's regular custom wants to sacrifice
for his family just in case Just in
case Just in case my son sin I'm I'm
going to go and make sure he's okay What
kind of man is this This is amazing
right In chapter two we know we know
that Job goes on to suffer tremendously
And it doesn't seem fair In chapter 2 to
paint the picture on the day uh on
another day the angels came to present
themselves before the Lord and Satan
also came with them to present himself
before him And the Lord said to
Satan where have you come from I find
that quite a peculiar question God
asking Satan where have you been Right
And Satan answered the Lord from roaming
throughout the earth going back and
forth on it And then the Lord said to
Satan "Have you considered my servant
Job There is no one on earth like him He
is blame." This is coming from the Lord
He is blameless and upright a man who
fears God and shuns evil I I I wish I
hope that the Lord can describe me like
that What an amazing thing right And he
still maintains his integrity though you
incited me against him to ruin him
without any reason
Skin for skin replied
Satan A man will give all he has for his
own life but now stretch out your hand
and strike his flesh and bones and he
will surely curse you to your face Ah
the proposal of transactional
love Scratch his back and he'll scratch
yours kind of thing That's what Satan's
talking about He's just doing it because
you're nice to
him The darkness we experience is
sometimes a result of misunderstanding
the relationship we have with God We
tend to think that if we do everything
right go to church pray be good
Christians that we should be shielded
from
suffering But the Bible shows us
something different It shows us
something different in this passage also
Job was upright yet he suffered Hmon was
a servant of God yet he experienced this
overwhelming
darkness It's easy to slip into these
false expectations If I'm a faithful
Christian then God owes
me Let's be honest Some of our prayers
have kind of been like
that Come on Lord You know look at me
I'm I'm doing my stuff for you How about
you Give me D
We may not say it in those words but you
know what I'm saying is true deep down
there We can treat our relationship with
God like an a
transaction And when it doesn't go
expected we feel
abandoned When it doesn't go as we
expected we feel abandoned
Right It sounds like I'm writing a
letter to s Santa angling for a present
at Christmas time And when we don't get
it I'm like seriously
Ah my life is over Right The object of
misery in which we focus a
lens will blur everything else around
it Like being thankful Jack spoke about
being thankful a few weeks
ago We kind of blur that out when we're
so focused on the darkness on the misery
on woe is me and we forget about the
homes that we have We forget about the
families that we have uh the church that
we have the food in our bellies right
There's a YouTube video that I I watch
every now and then It's called First
World Problems I've shared it with one
or two of you Um and it just keeps try
it tries to keep me grounded really
It's about some some kids in Africa that
clearly do not live in great conditions
and they're standing by a shack with
torn clothes and and uh they say things
like
um I hate it when my charger doesn't
reach my bedside
table or my favorite one because this is
me I hate it when I say no pickles and
they still give me pickles
And seeing these
kids poor and struggling say first world
problems like that Wow Really puts it in
perspective for me Like who in the world
do I think I am sometimes O get angry
about having pickles or no pickles
Seriously But we do We get so focused on
the little things
right Perhaps
um perhaps we learn this behavior when
we are young We cry until someone shows
up or we cry until we get our own way
Isn't that right
Callum 5:00 this morning guys Remember I
told you we didn't have sleep Yeah 5:00
this morning dude's like "Hey let's get
up and play." And uh good on my wife for
holding strong
But maybe we cry until we get our own
way Maybe that's something we learn from
young But as Psalm 88 reminds us
darkness is not the end It's it's a
moment in the journey of faith A journey
that includes both lamenting and
petitioning So in saying all
that is it good to lament Is it good to
cry out to God I like this word This is
harets It's a Hebrew word clearly read
from right to left
Yep It's the first letter there is hey
and then alf then
s Uh in the Hebrew pictograms which is
some of the early ancient writings hey
they draw like a man holding his arms up
which meant behold The second letter
would be drawn as an ox head which
represents God's strength you know a
leader And then the the third letter
there r is uh drawn like a the head of a
man representing man and then s it was
drawn uh like a journey So you got this
idea behold God and man on a journey
Guess what this word is in English Earth
It's in the first first uh verse of the
Bible Earth God and man on a journey I
love that
And why I bring up this journey idea
when we're talking about
lamenting it seems to me that Genesis
uh is very basic in its uh principles of
of
humanity You
obey you get blessed You
disobey
punishment Just like a little child When
I was a little child that's exactly how
we played the game You obey you get
blessed you
disobey mom stops the car and turns
around
right And as we grow and and we see this
in the Bible like there's this this
journey that grows out and and we we end
in Revelation with this intimate
relationship with God It's the same
thing Growing up I I get older I
understand the concept of not sticking a
metal fork into the electrical
outlet because my mom said no Right No
no no Now I start to understand now I
start to have an idea that my mother was
actually protecting me when she was
yelling at me to not do that I start to
understand that love behind
it So there's this journey that I see Uh
I no longer fear my parents I have a a
better relationship with them Just like
this ends in Revelation where we have
God in an intimate rel so intimate that
he calls it a marriage So we start off
basic the Torah the law and we journey
through the Bible and we see these these
hardships and these
struggles and it's all heading towards
this intimate relationship with
God So again back to Job with remarkable
devotion Job's journey through darkness
which seems
unfair In fact so unfair that after a
week of silence and weeping with his
friends which I think is the greatest
thing they could have done they begin to
try and reason this
out Doesn't go well right Um their
silence and suffering seems to threaten
us So instead of being still they start
to try and rationalize what's happening
And Job's lamenting if you've ever read
the book of Job it goes on and on and on
and it's a long book right Job's
lamenting goes on for 36
chapters And he starts getting angry
asking questions Why Where are you Show
yourself Job 30:20 he says I cry out to
you God but you do not answer I stand up
but you merely look at me You turn on me
ruthlessly With the might of your hands
you attack me
Wow But then God shows
up And how amazing to have the one who
can give the
answers to be there He He can give the
answers but instead God's like "Oh
yeah." He says "Who is this that
obscures my plans with words without
knowledge Brace yourself like a man I
will question you and you shall answer
me Where were you when I laid down the
the foundations Do you know the
dimensions Who let the wild donkey go
free That's a fun one to me Can you pull
a Leviathan with a a fish hook Answer me
Job For four chapters this mental
spanking goes on and it's brutal
So why am I saying all this Because it
culminates to me in the the intimate
conclusion for Job Job's response was
"My ears had heard of
you but now my eyes have seen
you." Very different I I heard of you
but now I see you There's an intimacy
there
See God doesn't rebuke Job for his
lamenting Rather he meets him in his
questioning This shows that lamenting is
not wrong It is an authentic form of
worship It is our way of crying out to
God even in our pain If you read the
book of Psalms read the Bible In fact my
brother Sean he elegantly put it Psalms
it's
whiny He's right It is whiny
But who better to take those cries to
That's the lesson Turn to him The one
who wants to hear from you The one who
can handle your pettiness Now I'm not
advocating for being disrespectful to
God I'm not advocating for that because
I personally want to avoid four chapters
of really hard gut churning heart heart
piercing questions
right But cry out to him Take your fears
and your struggles even your anger
worship
him I tell you what there's a consistent
message in the Bible that God always
wins I promise you you're not going to
do anything special to overthrow
God So if you do go down this road just
remember God wins
We may not always receive the answers we
want when we want them The darkness
doesn't always lift immediately And yet
our cries still matter to God Throughout
the scriptures we see examples of people
who wept and cried out and petition God
in their times of trouble Jesus David
Peter Paul Jacob Moses Esau Ishmael
Esther Hannah Naomi Ruth Orpa Hagar Mary
Magdalene Mary of Bethany the Canaanite
woman Job Jeremiah Jonah Ezra Nehemiah
Joseph and on and on and on no on no on
no on no on no on no on no on no on no
on no
on Give God what God wants
you So that's why David ends with uh
comes to this
conclusion You do not delight in
sacrifice but I would bring it You do
not take pleasure in burnt
offerings My sacrifice oh God is a
broken
spirit and contrite heart A broken and
contrite heart You God will not despise
This is coming from a man who sacrificed
a bull every six steps while moving the
ark That's a lot of blood
He comes to that realization Oh you want
my broken
spirit to lament for what When he says
you caused my beloved and my friend to
shun me My companions have become
darkness Wow God you you've left me that
now darkness is my friend Hello darkness
my old friend
He's speaking from a deeply subjective
experience of abandonment And yet even
in his darkness God was present God is
present And even when he fel felt
abandoned God is still with us and with
him He has not
left Four years
ago I was in the ICU quarantine unable
to breathe
The world around me seemed
uh very very very dark and I felt
utterly alone
Um I remember being in the hospital room
and it was dark but the lights were on
and my eyes were open and it was dark I
felt it I could see
it It was terrifying It felt like death
was holding my hand Um and it did It
felt like God had turned away from me It
only we we get ourselves into this crazy
thought
process But in that darkness that I was
going through it was not death that
frightened me That's what I realized It
wasn't death I wasn't scared of dying My
wife will be fine She's pretty She'll
find someone
right She's
gone She's already
gone But I wasn't scared of dying I tell
you church I was so afraid of being
alone
I can still feel
that in my fear and isolation I
discovered what I truly needed wasn't
provision God gave me things I just
wanted his
presence That's all that that that Hmon
is telling us Like I just want your
presence He's he's trying to provoke God
I guess to please like be with me It
feels like you're not here The truth is
God hadn't abandoned me at that time
just as he hasn't abandoned him and or
anyone in the Bible who went through
these similar
trials So we may be convinced that God
expresses his love through provision But
what we really seek is his presence and
the ultimate expression of God's love
when God himself went to the cross He
was forsaken by all So let me ask you
this question Who was with him
when he was taking on the sins of the
world who was with him when everyone was
gone his only companion was
darkness
Objectively
wow Satan is right about us We are
self-centered and exploit others We
deserve to have God turn his face from
us We deserve the darkness But in Jesus
the true loneliness that objective
separation from God has been defeated He
took the full weight of it so that we
only feel the
loneliness Feel
it We no longer are destined to become
it We can feel it but we know that God
is still there
In the garden of Gethsemane was a place
where this darkness descends on Jesus
knowing what he has to do He could have
abandoned us He
didn't Instead he chose to suffer for us
so that in our suffering we could have
hope So when you find yourself in the
darkness remember when you feel forsaken
lament petition pray and praise God Cry
out to the one who hears you who knows
your pain and who promises to never
leave you You are not
alone He truly had to become friends
with
darkness to save
us We just feel
it I wonder what that must have been
like Hmon's sarcastic question I'll
finish with this
Do the dead rise up and praise
you Do the dead rise up and praise
you Might seem like an accusation but
the answer is
yes Thanks to
Jesus Though we experience suffering and
decay in this life we experienced
injuries and and um I don't know bad
shoulders and bad backs and knees and
troubles and cancers and all these kinds
of
things I wonder if we ask the question
are you hurting If our response should
be yeah nothing a little resurrection
can't
fix A day is coming where all will be
made new Uh you're going to you're going
to want to be a part of that day You
know the Bible says 365 times do not be
afraid You are not alone We don't have
to be afraid anymore Stand in his
presence Seek his presence Seek his face
And know that he is he is with you
always
Even when the darkness feels
overwhelming if you need Jesus we all
need Jesus
But if you don't want to be alone
anymore if you want to get out of this
darkness if you want to make things
right now is a great
